Most of the food is good, 1
Only been here one time so far but it was really good. Good appetizers, 1
First time visiting.  Food was great.  Service was ok.  Loved the green tea and the potstickers rocked my socks., 1
This has become our "neighborhood" Thai place, 1
Handsdown, 1
This place was pretty amazing! Probably the nicest lounge I have seen. It is located next to gate D1, 1
The Good:  Prettiest girls in AZ. Before midnight 70% girls in the club.  The Bad: Girls leave around midnight and it becomes sausage fest.  The Ugly: After midnight it's too packed, 1
I've been here a few times. This place is excellent.  The venue itself is fun. I like being able to watch the paella being made.  The wine selection is great. I've never had a disappointing wine.  I've had a number of different tapas ranging from the paella (great) to chicken, 1
Having just moved to Matthews, 1
My husband and I stopped here for a light breakfast, 1
It's the go-to bar after work.  Can't complain as it has friendly staff, 1
The food is always great and the owners and staff provide exceptional service and make you feel very welcome. Also, 1
Went here after visiting a Moon Valley. The prices here are amazing and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. We spent 30 minutes trying to find someone to talk to at Moon Valley, 1
I first tried this place in Portland, 1
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!! From the recliner chairs to the huge iMax like movie screen.We found this theater through fandango. I've never heard of it so I looked on here for reviews and was surprised to see the awesome pictures of reclining chairs and alcohol being sold. My husband and I just had to check it out. We bought our tickets online picked our seats (z18 & 19 last row in the back). When we walked in, 1
I returned to this place a couple of times, 1
Yep call me a SoCal vietnamese food snob... But this is probably some of the best pho in Phoenix since I've moved here! The owners are really down to earth and have great service... Even got a free egg roll! Definitely will be back to try the rest of their menu!, 1
Really enjoy the food there. Mongolian beef, 1
A great place for drinks and creative food after work!  Atmosphere: A very urban take on western, 1
First let me thank my yelp friend Kelly O., 1
I had to eat a quick lunch yesterday and the only thing in the neighborhood was a McDonald's.  Persconally, 1
I am not a tea drinker. I don't like tea in any shape, 1
There's always a wait, 1
First time here and we will be back! Incredible customer service and AWESOME food. We had heard from many friends about their pizza. All was true. I do believe we have found the best pizza in Charlotte!  I am a strong believer in good customer service and our experience was above and beyond. Keep it please. It is what sets you apart. Other restaurants should take notice., 1
My wife and I went here for lunch a few days ago.  I tried to be super smart and healthy and ordered the Chipotle Ranch salad, 1
Absolutely wonderful. Obviously expensive but worth every penny!, 1
Normally I would steer clear of chain restaurants like this while on vacation. I can visit Buca di Beppo at home, 1
If you're seeking some delicious, 1
Location is great! Check in was not so great...it took 1 hour to check in. Maybe because it was Memorial Day weekend, 1
Stopped in here for some camera assistance during the protest.   They were so busy they forgot to lock the door at closing and people were still coming in.  They were very nice about it, 1
After scanning Yelp's reviews of this place, 1
Being that my boyfriend is a vegetarian, 1
I came here for a birthday party today and was thoroughly impressed! I can honestly say it is one of the nicest parks I have ever been to. There were baseball fields, 1
I cooked the best pork roast ever tonight. Fantastic cut of meat. Thanks Adonis., 1
The only Tilted Kilt experience I enjoyed. Our server was a sweetheart and wasn't trying too hard to flirt in order to get a good tip. Food was excellent: GET THE PULLED PORK SANDWICH. Nothing amazing enough to get 5-stars, 1
This is the most beautiful hotel I've ever seen.  So much to see and do here.  It's almost overwhelming.  Filled with statues and fountains.  Makes you feel like you've stepped into an actual palace.   Fabulous, 1
Five star burgers. Just go.  Asian fusion theme with super quality ingredients and prices are amazingly reasonable for the quality provided, 1
I have visited Vegas about four times within the past year and Jason at Hot Shot Vegas has helped make our experiences unforgettable!!! Seriously! Every visit myself and my group of girlfriends get treated like QUEENS! Each and every trip Jason has been my go to contact and has not let me down!  He has been very fast to respond to our request and has helped make all of our Vegas dreams come true! I recommend himself and the company to anyone in a small or large group. He really enjoys what he does and is great at it. Looking forward to my Vegas trip this weekend!, 1
SO DELICIOUS! This place has yummy breakfast. Its the first place in Arizona where I found good Eggs Benedict. Its a nice and quiet place for a late brunch. My husband had the country fried steak and eggs that he loved. The potatoes that come with your meal were excellent. I'll be going back. The reasoning for the 4 stars is that we sat and waited for along time for our drink order to be taken. The waitress the whole time was behind the bar counter talking to another waiter about some girl problem he was having. See thats how quiet it is in there I heard their whole conversation., 1
I was really surprised with this place. We stopped to give it a shot since we pass it everyday. The food was delicious. The se\u00f1or taco burro was HUGE and I don't mean chipotle huge I mean 2 chipotle burritos huge. The flavors were perfect. I can't believe I didn't eat here before now., 1
Bei einer Radtour vor ein paar Wochen den Kofler ausprobiert.  Gegessen habe ich Bibelsk\u00e4s mit Kartoffeln. Gute fand ich, 1
Chima is an excellent place to go for a night of protein gluttony. This is a classic churrascaria where gauchos walk around with various meats. They offer various cuts of beef, 1
Zuma is our go-to place on Mill when we want a cheap dinner and drinks. The food is decent for bar food and the menu is quite varied with burgers, 1
If you want to be met with friendly service and a staff that is extremely knowledgeable then this is the place to go.  Not is this store clean, 1
This is my favorite of only two dispensaries I go to in the Valley (and I frequent this one much more). The quality of their meds tops anyone else's - believe me, 1
A friend and I ate dinner at Sky tonight and left impressed! The decor is inviting and laid back with good ambient lighting. We started with the server recommended appetizer of King crab with avocado sushi rolls. I'm not a big fan of sushi yet, 1
Oddly, 1
Totally awese.  I ordered my wedding cake from out of town without ever sampling, 1
Had a 3 piece dark with dirty rice and a sweet tea. The chicken was hot and crispy, 1
Give this place a try....you will love it!  I just recently moved here and its always hard to find a new business for all your needs.  Thanks to other customer reviews on Yelp I decided to try The Birthday Suit.  I was able to make a same day appointment with Stacey.  She is wonderful, 1
You will get value meals.  Unhealthy as in all American Restaurants, 1
We had a party of 30 and the staff was very attentive and did not fail to entertain!, 1
You can't go wrong with their appetizer and small dishes here. We particularly like rock shrimp tempura (crispy outside and extra soft inside!!), 1
Went last night because it was the only thing open in the hotel. I ordered the prime rib French dip and fries. I also tasted the fried chicken. They were both outstanding. Honestly the fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had which shocked the hell out of me. The restaurant is laid out kind of strange in terms of tables and decor, 1
This place always makes us happy. Simple, 1
So decided to watch this show. MGM is running a winter promo where we got second row seats for around $99 a person. Not bad. We entered a bit late to the show but had a fantastic experience.  I don't want to say too much to spoil it but the theater setup was pretty amazing. Though I would not really recommend sitting too close because the pro is that you get to see the actors face and all the details. but when they are flying above you, 1
It's been a while crocodile!  It has been a good few years since I've popped in here, 1
Wow.  Wow.  Triple wow.  My favorite designer at amazing prices? Yes please.  My only question - Why aren't you closer to me??  Beautiful $800 suits for $350. $200 shirts for $80. The quality of the material and products at this store is unmatched by most retailers these days. On top of that, 1
The medium cut smoked meat sandwich on rye is very good.  It tastes like an extra meaty and flavorful pastrami sandwich.  Unlike Katz's, 1
YES YES! NY Pizza for sure! Upon entering I was greeted by a very nice straight forward lady. I made it known that i was visiting from NYC and i heard great things about this place and she said (very confidently) you heard right and you wont be dissapointed. Oh boy was she right! One bite and i was back in Manhattan! Too bad i been eating out of the other "NY" places around here this whole time :(.  So good! I wish you guys the best! So mad I only ordered 2 slices., 1
I had a very good chicken salad from there today, 1
What a busy cafe/bakery!!  LOVE the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain~ What a beautiful design!!   Always crowded but it is fun to wain in line and check out the merchandise or pastries.   A little bit pricey... but it is in a such a beautiful hotel, 1
Still great after all these years! Now even better that they are open 24/7. Menu has not changed a lot, 1
We bypass Nakama to come here. Great food, 1
A Wonderful place Downtown. Owners always onsite and very welcoming and warm. True Brave Souls to provide something cool in our area that is up and coming. They have a great restaurant where you can actually have a conversation in these great booths, 1
Basic four star mostly due to the location.  The view is fantastic and the food is fairly good but nothing you will remember.  We had the Chef's table...note it is not a true chef's table kitchen side, 1
First timer!   Meats were fresh and plentiful. kalbi ribs and ribeye were excellent. Next time I come, 1
You really cannot go wrong in a restaurant based upon everything and anything chocolate. From the moment you walk in, 1
Our service Austin was amazing!! Never would I imagine having such great service at an IHOP. He was super friendly, 1
Who still has a video player??   I do, 1
The Walgreens I've always dreamed of... Lol.. Ever since They did a remodel this place is excellent!! It's the Costco of Walgreens. There are aisles upon aisles of stuff and they're open 24 seven. Fresh food brought in daily like at QT. Photo products also 24/7. Friendly staff and Super clean store.. During regular hours there is also a take care clinic. Nice!!!, 1
I hadn't been to Tao in a while and I didn't think I'd enjoy my time here, 1
This is a first time appointment for me - so based on this one experience alone... They we're very professional in taking the appointment, 1
The service is a solid 5 stars, 1
I like the concept of this place...brings you back in the day! The burgers are good...a variety of choices - good combinations. The fries are realy good - Suzie Q fries. Pretty good for a burger joint!, 1
This place is amazing. I'm just a bit sad cause they only have one location. I love the location though. The first time I went here was with an old friend. They told me it was good. So I met up with them. I love the atmosphere here. It's so relaxing and calm compared to any other burger joint.  I took my boyfriend here for the first time and when he took a bite into his blue cheese burger he seriously had an erection and his eyes were watery cause he fell in love with this place. The service here is good. From all the times me and my boyfriend went there, 1
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I guess I took it for granted as it was my first non-RA sushi experience in Arizona.  I love Zen 32, 1
The wait is over...  The new BB10 is here.  Hub keeps you in sync with all the latest messages in a single inbox whereever they may come from.  Flow allows you to move data from one application to another.  Peek allows you to look at another app while staying in the original app.  Balance allows you to keep your personal and enterprise information separate on your phone.  BlackBerry 10 is here now and I am so happy I got to play with the new phones, 1
It's not officially a trip to Vegas for me if I don't have a meal here. I have entertained clients (sometimes twice in one day) and have been there more times than I can count with my wife, 1
Best Vietnamese I've had, 1
Great Mexican food!! Very  Good chips and the flavors are great! The atmosphere is very nice. Drinks pricey ... But that's everywhere on the strip.  I like the black beans they use . It's also little more healthy than traditional  Mexican food., 1
I'm not a big fan of LVAC, 1
EASILY my favorite Mexican Restaurant in PHX... hands-down. We've been here several times and I have no idea why I've waited until now to tell the world how yummy this place is.   It's VERY small and can get busy, 1
Nom Nom! Awesome Pho and Spring Rolls! Prices are great and staff is super friendly! Stop and try if you're a Pho fanatic like me =), 1
After a recent visit to Ling & Louie's Asian Bar & Grill ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/ling-and-louies-asian-bar-and-grill-scottsdale ) in Scottsdale, 1
I love Venezia's, 1
I love the calzones here.. Just order a small and it will feed 2 people.  A-MA-ZING, 1
We went here on a birthday splurge, 1
I go here to pick up specific indian veggies that are not available at the regular grocery stores, 1
This was a GREAT time.. We had a business event at 'Rain' which was ok, 1
If you want a legit college town experience go to Peter's Pub.  If you're out of the college scene (as I am) you can still enjoy Peter's for lunch.  If you're in college, 1
Everyone calls this the back east in n out Burger. I thought it was a very good burger a little more than in n out but worth it. Fries are good and they give you A LOT of them in the small order., 1
Best dog park in Mesa... large area for dogs to play in.. tons of free poopy bags available, 1
It is good to be able to go to the mall and find what sporting equipment or athletic shoes, 1
I absolutely love this place. My favorite bakery !! Love the cream cheese buns and the coffee buns. It's so cute and comfy here. I come often to do homework. I love the Korean language spoken around me and the music., 1
My fave place on Mill Ave.They have great happy hour deals and it's fun to sit out on the patio and people watch.  The sangria is light and refreshing and I would definitely recommend the Mediterranean plate...it's delicious!, 1
Super good chicken and waffles and ham eggs Benedict. I always love fresh squeezed OJ.  I love the ambience, 1
If you love seafood and you are in Vegas, 1
Very good dumplings. Suggest getting them fried., 1
Things I love about Hooters: 1. Wings.  2. classy decor, 1
I just want to say I had an issue with the heat a few months ago, 1
I had read reviews about Ichiban and Fugu having both authentic Chinese cuisines in Madison.  I recently went to Fugu so I had to go to Ichiban.    The staff allowed us to peruse the menu for a while before taking our order.  It's huge and many things sound yummy.  We spent some time trying to get a look of other's meals without being too obvious and rude.   I decided to order 3 ingredient potstickers for all of us.  I love hot and sour soup so I ordered their sour and spicy seafood soup for myself, 1
The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the waiting time.  Be ready to stand in line for around an hour and then wait like 1/2 an hour more to get your food.  Everything I've tried here is amazing.  If you love Seafood, 1
Great ambiance! Corn were awesome! Drinks are great! Seating is mainly for large groups. Service was okay. Would go again and with a larger group of friends., 1
I was on this side of town and remembered this place was opening and decided to stop by and check it out. I sure am glad I did. I am also glad I had my coupons in my purse! This place is friggen amazing. There are so many neat things here. My favorite is the live bee hives they have. You can dispense your own honey! And its actually pretty cheap. And oh so yummy!! They also have a great bulk food section. I had a full shopping cart and my bill was 70 bucks. Such great prices. I will be at the one in Henderson every week or two doing my shopping since its much closer to me., 1
I like the clothing here.  I'm not a big fan of having a store's name plastered across my body in 4" lettering.  They do have some of that here, 1
Stubborn knots? Achy shoulders? Throbbing sciatica? Yeah, 1
I'm not a huge fan of IHOP and I've had some shotty experiences at multiple locations across the country.  This one on Craig Road next to the Howard Johnson is alright in my book though.  Service was friendly and the food was not too shabby.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  It was supposed to come with honey mustard but they brought me ranch dressing.  Whatever.  I don't care much for ranch but I was not going to argue over it.  I don't use much dressing for my chicken anyhow.  My mom ordered the pumpkin pancake combo with hash browns, 1
It's about time i got this review posted considering I have been eating lunch here at least once a week since I was told how close to work this was.  The food here is really good and fresh. I am a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine and I was surprised they had one of my favorites, 1
My biggest complaint is that they are not open on Monday.  Seems I always crave the sol on mondays.  They have an excellent selection of combos to choose from.  Quick service, 1
I really like this joint, 1
Absolute delight.   I was pleasantly surprised by the food they serve. From the outside, 1
This is definitely a chick-oriented bar. Hilariously creative decor (lots of shiny red leather, 1
Called places to get my battle axe laser engraved on especially a difficult item such as an axe, 1
Great price and great service.  Would recommend to everybody.  Same price as those haircut chains but much better haircut and you finish with a straight razor shave on the neckline. Just moved over to this side of town and Jimmy gives the best old school business cut., 1
Stopped in here for lunch today, 1
Vanessa has been our pet sitter for the last two years, 1
The gelato is delicious, 1
Let's get right to it.  The smell of GRILLED ONIONS hits you before you even touch the front door.  That is the definition of a Chicago dog/burger joint.  That IS Maxwell Street.  That IS Chicago.  The Food - I ordered the fire dog, 1
We have been going to Firebirds for years.  Used to be there was never a wait, 1
Unsurpassed !!!!    Our Dinner in the new "Praying Monk" dining area of Elements was fantastic... the view... spectacular!!   The new dining area is awesome... more intimate and less "active" then then the main dining room, 1
I had an unexpectedly lengthy layover at the Charlotte airport during my recent venture to the midwest, 1
Great little bakery hidden in a run down looking strip mall. Don't let the location fool you. This was my first visit, 1
Had another great meal...we sat at the bar. The ambiance is cozy and dim. Nice televisions playing sports. I always build my own pasta: half marinara/ half Alfredo, 1
Dr. Swenson really surprised me considering he actually took the time out to listen to what I (as a patient) had to say. I rarely have that experience like most patients. The staff and NSFMC are very kind and patient too. If you do not have insurance, 1
Great Service.  Only $17 for spa pedicure- I did $5 for callus removal, 1
My husband and I were walking around downtown Chandler, 1
Feeling a bit under the weather from Friday night, 1
Friendly staff and good happy hour prices. Love the setting. Family style bar and a bleached brick wall along with the "vintage" Tim roof make this a pretty cool place to hang out for the evening. Live music on the weekends. Very popular at night. I hope this place makes it. With the Perfect Pear across the street, 1
I cannot believe this place closed )):, 1
This is a great place to get all you can eat fish fry. A very casual place with great service and good food. I will definitely return!!!, 1
I looked in Yelp and found great reviews about it, 1
I love Zipps! I have been going to Zipps for years mainly to watch sports on one of the many televisions they have playing or for their amazing wings and Happy Hour. The wings are better grilled too so try them that way!, 1
If you are looking to rent a bike, 1
Excellent catering service!, 1
I'm giving these guys the max (5 stars) because I go here at least once a week and the food is always great - at an incredibly reasonable price. The menu is very varied, 1
Make the effort to walk to the Palazzo Grand Lux Cafe. Less people and cleaner than the Venetian one. Just walk past the Palazzo waterfall and before you hit the escalator make a right.  Can't wait to go back. Great service and wonderful food. Nice plating and clean. This is so so so so so much better the Cheese Cake Factory. So much better!  Loved all of it:  http://www.grandluxcafe.com/menu.htm  Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya  Sauteed with Peppers, 1
I follow the Yellow Brook Road. On Friday night it led me to the South Point Show Room/ Malibu Club (from this point on referred to as the South Point Show Room)    A show room is as good as the entertainment. When classic rock tribute band Yellow Brick Road performs on Friday night from 10:30 into midnight, 1
fall in phoenix was made for the main ingredient.  who doesn't love an all day happy hour sunday/monday patio situation? a little hip hop, 1
Love this place! Entrance is 3 dollars but every thing else is 2 dollars. Beer, 1
Great food. I have been coming to this location and the one on Marks for years. Love the choice of music (Beatles, 1
I visited Lux for the first time with a friend for coffee and breakfast. The atmosphere was great! The place has hipster vibe as well. It is also has plenty of space to sit inside and outside.   The coffee was everything coffee should be. I ate a blackberry orange scone - delicious!   There's much more to be explored about this place, 1
We've been fans since Joe's opened. Best BBQ in the valley. Pecan-smoked meats are sweet and succulent. Hungry first-timers should check out the Sampler Platter. If you're lucky enough to arrive on a rare day when they have their rib-tip sandwich available, 1
This is my favorite spot in AZ for a mani/pedi.  I walk in a chipped, 1
Went here on a Monday night for dinner and drinks.  We arrived in time for happy hour, 1
Although it is a popular night/after work spot, 1
Its a bit different from what most people think of when eating burritos.  Not a bad thing at all since the food is tasty indeed!  This is the first time I've had New Mexican food.  The portions are large.  I had trouble finishing my meal let alone the side I foolishly ordered.  My only complaint would be that since the food is a bit different than expected, 1
Robert Ledbetter And the first option mortgage team are awesome they made the process of buying a new home a amazing experience they made everything so easy and enjoyable they are super professional and I would recommend them thanks rob for everything you put Chris and I in our dream home and we couldn't be happier, 1
I tried Rosati's for the first time recently after hearing great things about it for a long time.  I got the Hawaiian pizza with the crispy thin crust and some chicken strips.  The Hawaiian pizza comes with Canadian bacon, 1
This old world establishment is perfect for a hearty, 1
Enjoyed an outstanding meal here last. Server, 1
Absolutely the best buffet in vegas.  There is no other buffet any better anywhere. this is the only one I'm willing to go to in Vegas., 1
We sadly needed Dr. Fixler's services this morning & I am very happy that I stumbled upon Happy Endings when researching my poor girl's end of life experience.   I emailed late last night after reviewing their very helpful website about Abby's condition and received a call from Alicia first thing this morning. Even earlier than I had expected. She was very helpful in promptly scheduling our appointment & gave good advice concerning our kids & other dog.   Dr. Fixler & assistant (in my grief I didn't properly catch her name) arrived when expected & gave me a call 10 minutes prior to arrival. Dr. examined Abby & set our minds at ease regarding our decision. He fully explained everything and gave us the time we needed.   I am so thankful Abby was able to spend her last moments at home & be comfortable. Everyone at Happy Endings is incredibly compassionate & professional and I highly recommend them. I wish I could give them 10 stars., 1
This gas station/mini mart is very convenient. I don't buy gas here the prices are always high. Maybe because it's on a major intersection, 1
First time into this place, 1
I've stayed at the MGM Grand 3 times in recent memory. Once in their regular grand room, 1
So after 16 years I decided to get another tattoo to cover up one I got when I was 18.  After doing some research and finally deciding to go to FU's I was introduced to Hans.  Upon first meeting him he didn't strike me a what I had in mind as a tattoo artist. But after talking to him and telling him what I was looking for I had set up my appointment for 3 weeks later. Hans told me he would draw something's up and have them for me the day of the appointment.  Upon arriving I was told he was running behind and wasn't sure how long it was going to be.  But hey the man is an artist and I really wasn't expecting him to be as excited to start as I was.  After the shortest wait I've ever had for some one who was running behind which was a whole 3 minutes. I was then a little surprised and worried when he told me he hadn't prepared anything and if I could show him a picture he could draw something up.  Now I was thinking uh oh this could be bad but remember I did say Hans was an artist and his is where he proved it or real.   After taping a pic to a arm rest he went to work by drawing a sketch on my arm for 45 minutes and when I saw what he had done I was more than impressed.  I made one minor change and Hans went to work.  I sat there for he next 4 hours looking around at one of he coolest places you old choose to get ink done.   From the chair at the front window I sat there and watched countless people walk up and down the streets of NoDa while also checking out a Kelly Slater ESPN special that was playing brought the window of Cabo Fish Taco.  I have to say from the view and just listening to the people that work at FU's my experience was definitely enjoyable. But as for Hans I'm truly impressed he is the man.  My quarter sleeve cover up is amazing and I will most definitely be getting my future work done by him.   If your in Charlotte and looking to have something done call FU's and ask to meet with Hans because he is the man. Oh yeah and if you were wondering it only cost about half of what other shops in the area were wanting for a similar piece and time., 1
I'm told they are expensive and there are other places that are better, 1
I came here on a Sunday for lunch. The wait for our party of 5 was around 20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering there were shops nearby to visit in the meantime. Our server was very accommodating and had all sorts of things to recommend. He brought out free popcorn for us as starters. It tasted very interesting, 1
Excellent quality and quantity and great bang for your (cash only) buck!  I order Gail's Eggs every single time I come here but have sampled husband's pancakes, 1
My fellow Yelpers didn't steer me wrong again, 1
The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, 1
Salsa and Chips are HUGE....Great location, 1
After trying the sundance special for the very first time, 1
Been here TONS of times. Always solid. Everything always tastes fresh to me. I could fill up on their jumbo scallop nigiri and call it a day. It literally melts in your mouth :)     They have an extensive Japanese food menu and LOTS of specialty rolls and 4 pages of appetizers! Don't miss these because there are some gems on there like the firecracker.   The decor is very cool (don't miss the bathrooms) and they have outdoor seating which is really nice when it's not too hot. If you haven't tried it, 1
I have been to Five guys in 3 different states now and I still love it. I am originally from so cal and I grew up on in and out. I only tried 5 guys because Obama went...and I ended up falling in love it. Their burgers have a lot more flavor and are just great. I actually prefer in and outs fries though. Anyways, 1
I came here from my friends recommendation. That and we both love sushi. Now I've never done sushi in Vegas before, 1
This place is always so good. We shared a plate and it was more than enough food. The portions are generous. Our waitress, 1
Used to be a bit of a dive when I used to shop here for cheap groceries several  years ago, 1
Like other reviews says this Chinese Restaurant has a DRIVE THRU !! I've never seen a Chinese restaurant has it, 1
Second time coming in and Anthony does an excellent work in fills! Best fills I've ever gotten. Also Kevin is such a welcoming owner! Definitely coming back., 1
Always a good cup of espresso iced coffee., 1
The best. Well updated. Never fails. Chris is the best promoter in town BAR NONE!, 1
THey make an incredible martini.  The food is very good.  It is not Capital Grille.  It is not Mortons.  It is a good, 1
Dr O is the best, 1
i walked in slightly moody and bitchy; and walked out refreshed and happy. my friend and i decided we were in some serious need of pampering; so we made appointments for facials and pedicures. the salon is kinda out there but well worth the drive. it was very clean and everyone was really friendly.   i started with the basic facial. holly took very good care of me. i kept dozing in and out of consciousness. :) it was towards the end when she was massaging my head and temples... ya almost knocked me out. :D  after my facial, 1
If you're going to Vegas to have a good time, 1
I hate that I can't give Gordon Ramsey Steak 5 stars!  My wife and I planned our Vegas trip 6 months in advance and the number one thing I wanted to do was eat at one of Gordons restaurants, 1
I used this bakery for my destination wedding in Vegas. I was planning everything over the phone for the wedding and they were very accommodating. The woman I spoke to was able to give me great suggestions as far as the flavors they carried. The pictures on the website were helpful and I chose a cake from the bride on a budget section. I chose the Gerber daisy cake. She suggest the Bavarian cream  filing and said that was their specialty filling. I chose one layer chocolate, 1
Lunch buffet was only $9.99! The best quoalit and great selection.  I want to try dinner soon.  Love it!  :), 1
Basil ice cream and mango ice cream!  Mix them together and you have something crazy good on your lips.  I also got the espresso and vanilla bean mix.  Topped that off with whipped cream and cookie chunks.  Try their toasted marshmallows and bacon brittle for a different tasty experience., 1
Holy shit fuck this place is amazing! Hands down, 1
Delicious sushi! Lots of variety. Good drinks. Great for lunch and dinner! Full bar. Also they have coupons time to time on GroupOn. Would recommend., 1
This is convenient if you live in the area and are too far away to drive to the closest Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. Keep in mind while their store isn't entirely organic or natural, 1
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Service was outstanding! Great ambiance! Fantastic views! Very chic/retro and approachable! Great Wine List! WOW! The food was so outstanding that we cannot wait to get back there! Staff was very attentive without being invasive!, 1
Aria is my new official favorite Vegas hotel & casino.  Spent the weekend here with the wife and another couple and have a fantastic time.  The hotel itself is gorgeous, 1
I've been in the Phoenix area a few months and my friend was insistent that I had to check this place out.  My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch, 1
5? yeah 5!! Ok, 1
LOVE me some Cold Stone!  My new latest fav is Devil's Brew which is Coffee ice cream, 1
I ADORE this place!! It is right by my house, 1
Good beers and service. I love the stuffed mushroom appetizer so dee-lish. They have a gluten sensitive menu you too. The California chicken sandwich is my so good!! Grilled chicken with avocado and green chilies with pepper jack on sour dough. I know it's a chain but this location has a locals feel. Good eats with TV's everywhere. So no one will miss the game., 1
Good cheap eats! Fast Service !Love the Lime a Rita's !!!!, 1
Last time my Dad was in town, 1
I want it to give this place 5 stars but the only thing that keeps me from doing so, 1
Very much enjoyed my dinner at Carpe Diem.   I had a tasty scallop dish albeit a bit small portion wise and two delicious starters - the tuna and calamari. I was happy in the end that I did get appetizers or my meal might have been a bit small. The real stand out was the fresh bread- wow delicious..I literally couldn't stop reaching for another roll - even after I was full!   Our server was friendly and attentive- he recommended a nice chardonnay for my dinner and was pleasantly surprised it was in the $8 range.The atmosphere was a little stark- nicer for a quiet date than a girls night.   Overall id say bring your wallet- my meal with two drinks and an appetizer was about $60. I would absolutely visit again since everything was really yummy!, 1
Before Lucille's BBQ came to AZ we use to frequent this restaurant in CA.  Decor in Southern Style and always great prompt service.  They start you off with biscuits and an apple butter, 1
My wife and I had lunch here.  We started with the beef & blue cheese portabello mushroom. Extremely liberal with the beef and it was very delicious.  I ordered the Angus Beef burger with Provolone cheese on a cibata roll. Absolutely one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. Popeye's friend Wimpy would gladly pay on Tuesday, 1
I just opened an account at this bank after many years of banking with one of the national large chain banks. MidFirst reminds of the local community bank your parents banked at where customer service is key and the needs of the customer are a priority.   The product offering is highly competitive and I earn a very competitive rate on my checking account compared to other banks that require a significant amount on deposit. Additionally, 1
Food tasted good but service was not.   This is our fourth time in Vegas and we were meeting our friends from halfway around the world so we decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner here.   From researching online we saw that Andre's had great reviews as well it was located in the hotel we were staying at.   Since our friends could not understand english we asked the waitress if she could be patient with us first and foremost and if she could slowly explain some of the dishes they were interested in. She gave us a weird look and then explained pretty quickly using "food language" that people weren't normally associated with hearing esp those still learning english. OKAYYY....   Anyways we ordered the  Lobster Bisque Prime Angus Ribeye Rack of Colorado Lamb Celery Root & Truffle Risotto and 1 Banana Caramel & 1 Chocolate Souffle  and everything was very very delicious!   Here is a tip, 1
My niece who is a student at ASU, 1
Loved it!  Wonderful place, 1
Moved from Gilbert and ordered Chizona's on moving day!  Pizza was delicious and fresh, 1
We have been to the week-old Villa's twice now, 1
This place has the CUTEST little cakes.  Cute enough that I was stupid enough to walk over from the Palazzo at 10 in the morning on a Saturday just to pick one up for a birthday girl.  They also have cute truffle boxes.  It's like a step up from Godiva.  Cute, 1
Member here for 10 years total--  I love clean! I love being able to walk away from noisy kids and go into another pool since i am a swimmer I like choices. Cool people -- members keep to themselves dont try to interfere with your workout with chit chat  I LOVE THIS !! We are busy working out no talking needed ! Great classes!  Great equipment and you can use other clubs too with their membership win win  But umm yeah don't join K? It is hard enough to find parking as it is !  I went astray for a bit I will admit tried the Princeton Club to see what I was missing out on all the hoopla. What I found was old band aides that did not seem to move for days left around the pool and inches of standing water where you are supposed to wring out your suit NASTY !!  I found my way back and like the Prodigal son who returns home after making mistakes I am back and I am happy!!, 1
As a new patient, 1
I didn't see much of the restaurant, 1
Old Las Vegas signs have a home! Great place to get some of Las Vegas' history. Our guide was super informative, 1
*Disclaimer... I will try to keep the editorializing to a minimum because I know a couple of the staff here, 1
This place Is not as a good as a lot of the the Chinese super buffets but  they had 90+ items and everything I ate was good. All the food was was at the right temp. and the service was fast and friendly. This place gets way to many bad reviews so I am giving them 4 stars instead of a high 3 just to help them out.This is a buffet I would return to. So yes I am a fan.(chinese donuts real good)., 1
This is a great market, 1
Love dutch brothers coffee. Quick and super friendly service. We love the annihilator, 1
This place is great. I ordered the loco moco.  The meat was very flavorful along with the garlic fried rice it came with. I also ordered the short stack of hazelnut pancakes. They were fire as well!  My girlfriend ordered the adobo fried rice omelette and it was very good. I tried this dish at Aloha Kitchen and the one here at Babystacks puts the one at Aloha Kitchen to shame! The rice was flavorful and not dry.   Definitely coming back to this place when Im in town!, 1
Dim sum served all day in Summerlin? Yes please! All the dim sum we ordered - chicken shu mai, 1
Burger21 was a great experience. You can taste the freshness in the meat with every bite. After talking with the owner for a few minutes you can tell his passion for food and burgers. They have a vast selection of burgers, 1
Amazing therapist and a very kind person.  He's so talented. On top of being a wonderful therapist, 1
When it comes to Krispy Kreme there are a lot of mixed reviews out there. Generally speaking, 1
The drinks there were pretty good but it was a pity the crowd was not there!! Perhaps it was the long weekend that made everyone go out of town cuz counting our party at the lounge, 1
I love Chipotle. I know it's a chain and all, 1
Great place!  They really take the time to make sure you are happy before you leave, 1
I came here last night before walking over to the Benedum to see Alton Brown.  We arrived at just the right time around 4:30 and were seated without a wait.  The restaurant filled up quickly and a line formed for tables.  I wasn't feeling pizza (didn't know this was possible) but I'll definitely try one of them when I come back.  I ordered lasagna and enjoyed it but wasn't blown away.  They had an impressive draft list of crafts, 1
Definitely a place that you want to go to if you just want to sit, 1
This is a cute little pasta joint.  Very New Yorky feel minus Don Corleone :)  I had their pasta pollo which was delicious!  Drinks...well they are what they are... I'm not a big fan of mixed drinks except maybe a Irish car bomb Ouch!  However, 1
They have some SERIOUSLY delicious vegan pizza (with or without Daiya cheese) and vegan ice cream! Pop-Up Pizza is also easy to find, 1
The price is right!  The staff is attentive and caring.  Tina does an excellent job on our dogs and also has helpful tips with our dogs.    Mickey has been going here for several years and goes in looking like a pound puppy leaving looking like a show dog!  Minnie our newest addition has gone in a few times and each time she looks fantastic!  They even put a feather in her hair and she's gotten alot of compliments!  Dogs should'n't be caged and the cubbies that they have--I feel make our dogs feel more comfortable when they are a little shaky from being left in a somewhat foreign environment.    A++++, 1
I love this place. The food is always great. Amazing Pizza. Service is exceptional. It's 24 hours and I find myself stopping in on my way home from work for food and drinks. Very comfortable atmosphere with lots of games, 1
I love this place... I wish i could make it there more often! Turkey club is my favorite :), 1
I love Tott's. The atmosphere almost makes me feel at home and the guys always working the counter?-- An absolutely wonderful man who always talks to everybody and walks around checking that everything's okay. It's worth it to go just to see his smiling face! But then again, 1
This is mine and my wife's favorite Mexican restaurant to eat at!  Their chips and salsa are too die for and then we get a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style.  It's the best place in the valley and won't disappoint!, 1
The decor in this place was super cute. We came to the relization that coffee shops have the best customer service. Our waitress was excellent. It was a very homely enviornment. Yes, 1
This has been my favorite club by far in Vegas. Granted, 1
Excellent place and highly recommend! Wonderful personal customer service! Super friendly and endless selections and flavors! You owe it to yourself to check this place out!, 1
I can't say enough good things about Annie Singer over at Forever Grand Wedding Chapel at the MGM!  She was wonderful to work with and made our wedding planning stress free!  Our family and friends really enjoyed the ceremony and loved the chapel.  Thanks so much Annie!, 1
So I had to go to the hospital today for a procedure. I got up early and was hungry. Not peckish but hungry. So I decided to go to La Banquise for some poutine. I've always had take away there and have never eaten in.  I arrive there at 6 am. There is only one other customer. There are about 14 staff members cooking, 1
Our first night in Vegas for our Gal Vacai led us to get all dressed up and walk over to Tao for drinks, 1
Best little sandwich place ever!! I stop by and get the sparky at least once a week. Quick service delicious food, 1
Always yummy!  very polite, 1
Went for lunch on my way to Sprouts.  Tyler greeted me with a business card (RicE to MeeT YoU), 1
Lovely. Local. Friendly. Fresh.  This is how I would describe the Grove Cafe, 1
The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times., 1
Lancaster's BBQ is a nice place to eat in or take out and the staff are always friendly.  I have enjoyed the catfish (one of my favs), 1
We called late on Xmas eve and they were going to close early, 1
I've been here twice now at different times of the day, 1
i dig it, 1
Here is the skinny, 1
Returned for lunch today, 1
I love coming to Lenny's for two reasons. The first reason is that the burgers are awesome and the second reason is that it is right by my work.  It is easy to get in & out of and the service is quick.    It is a really cute little burger shop in downtown.  You just go to the cashier and order your food and then a couple minute later your food is ready.  My favorite burger here is the bacon cheeseburger with fries.     Happy Yelping., 1
The Bobcats are an up and coming team. Although they haven't had a great season, 1
The atmosphere was excellent, 1
I have mixed feelings about this bar.  It's crowded.  It's commercial and corny.  The sexual innuendo is sophomoric.  But so what?  It's fun!  Join the other drunken crazies and sing along.  Tip the singers, 1
I've eaten here more times than I can count, 1
Although a huge fan of bloody food. I have to say, 1
I Just noticed this place for the first time about a week ago and put it on my to-do list. I'm thinking this location is fairly new.  So I order a slice and a salad.  Very Pleased, 1
We came to Montreal for a conference, 1
Never had a bad meal here.  Hotcakes are delicious, 1
Wow! As good as the Paris location. We ordered the 10 course Prestige tasting, 1
The first "people love us on yelp" sticker....  after waking up to no coffee (which for the plus one and I is a huge FAIL) I typed in best brunch Scottsdale and fell upon a review that said essentially a lot of really great things but "strong coffee" was what I saw staring at me...   SOLD!   This place is super cute. Country Modern feel.... folks are friendly and it feels like you are in the country...but everything from the lighting to the black chairs is mod... LOVE IT. They are kid friendly, 1
We went to Marbella because we are locals and just happen to see it while driving by, 1
My wife and I have visited a couple of times, 1
New building...very open, 1
Great food for the price; we use Rocco's to obtain food for casual parties at home.  I love the Stromboli, 1
love the place, 1
Tina and Dina are the best! Thank you for being the awesome women that you are. Outstanding service., 1
I have been on two trips to Top Top now, 1
I went to Chima for the Queen's Feast, 1
I usually come here whenever I visit Arizona and I love it every time.  There is always a lot of people and good times.  I like how it is open air and Mexico themed, 1
I go to Vegas maybe 4 times a year and always come here everytime. The drinks Are good I have ordered steak, 1
Wow I almost fainted!  A best buffet place I went to during my trip to Las Vegas.  Food is delicious and looks good too!  Worth every penny eating there.  Crepe station is awesome, 1
This mall is huge!  They have tons of shopping options, 1
Is there a 10 star option?  Came here with a friend and we were staying on the strip and this was a refreshing atmosphere and pricing from our other options at the hotel spas on the strip.  I had Janice as my technician and she was from Scotland and she was super cute and super friendly and very thorough.  I had a shellac manicure and just a basic pedicure which I feel like when you get basic anything at a salon your service is pretty crappy because you didn't get all the upgrades but not here.  Janice was just as attentive even though I got the basic pedicure.  She talked to me the entire time, 1
These are the best burgers I've had since Umami. In fact, 1
Very enjoyable lunch after a long morning of traveling. After an early flight from Oregon wanted to get out of town a bit for a more low key introduction to the local cuisine before heading North. Great location, 1
An older course with large trees, 1
YO ur korean stayin in vegas for few days n u kno u need korean food, 1
I was craving some authentic Chinese food while exploring the Bellagio, 1
I was in Phoenix for business and wanting to relax so I came here because it was close to my hotel. I am a stickler about mani-pedis to the point where I don't get them anymore but had no choice since my nails looked tragic. It was totally empty and the women that did my nails were amazing! Paid very close attention to detail and couldn't be happier. My only complaint would be that their polish colors aren't the best but I found some good OPI I liked., 1
Great Pizza and wings special., 1
What a gem for the mainland! I love their specials they have throughout the week. Dana and his crew definitely got everything RIGHT with this place. The decor, 1
Radish, 1
Love this place.  Great sandwiches, 1
There are few places anywhere that you will find a curry for \u00a33.50 but right here at the Mosque Kitchen you can eat your heart out for next to nothing. I love the canteen feel, 1
Hey! Just went to Padres last night for a margarita. Went with a couple of friends, 1
I've heard about this Burger Bar last year and wanted to try it since we were in Las Vegas for the Labor day weekend and to celebrate my friends birthday. We had a party of 7 (5 adults & 2 kids) on Sat. night for dinner at 7 and was seated less than 5 minutes with no reservations!! Wow, 1
Best donut and clean place, 1

I've been to Maggiano's a number of times, 1
BBQ sandwich and french fries were great. The tea was just good. Service was very friendly. Will return, 1
Went for lunch earlier in the week. Love that they serve the Restaurant Week menu at lunch, 1
I had to write an update to my review of Holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  Everything from start to finish was amazing, 1
Pikolo. As the name suggests this is a tiny place.   + Consistent coffee, 1
The Spicy Basil Noodles with chicken was delish!, 1
Good food! Nice atmosphere! I love this place., 1
They have great pizza for a reasonable price...we always get the sicilian pizza because I have 2 teenagers that love to eat pizza. We always have plenty left over. They also serve beer and wine for a good price....a "mug" of wine for $5, 1
Excellent sushi here. All chef at the bar are Japanese too.  They have traditional Sushi and also creative menus upon request.  I recommend you to sit at counter. Very nice chefs can explain you about where the fish comes from, 1
Insert Coins is located in the older part of Vegas, 1
I really do save my 5s for OUTSTANDING restaurants.  But WCG deserves a 4.7 or so.  Absolutely delicious and I cant wait to try something else.  We skipped appetizers to make sure we had room for dessert.  I got the bacon burger (over the steak sammich) as the waiter said the burgers were great.  And he was right.  Very fresh, 1
I got the 3 meat plate. I had the pulled pork, 1
I ate here number of times and I never had a bad experience. Their breakfast are the best around. Only once did I ordered a dinner meal (it was OK), 1
I'm a little biased because I used to work here a while back. But think of it as an insiders report I suppose. The chefs in back are amazing and they all work extremely hard. They are really great with working with allergies and making sure your food is up to par. I don't know about you but I don't know to may places that offer good gluten free, 1
Great service. Cool atmosphere. Trying the Sage chicken as featured on Man vs. food. Highly recommended by the staff., 1
Wow!  Loved it. Tuna nachos. Sweet potato soup and Mesa burger made for a wonderful lunch. My wife and I left very happy!!! Thanks Mesa grill., 1
This is a great staple of Tempe.  I try to stop by here before spring training and Diamondback games.  If you're looking for a grill dog I would say this is the place to go., 1
Let me preface this with I am not a steak eater at all. I can blame my mom, 1
Having lived in China for a year, 1
I visited for the first time this week and tried the Black Bear latte. Delicious!  The atmosphere reminds me of the local coffee shops back in the Midwest, 1
I come to this place about once a month, 1
This is a very nice and clean coffee bean & tea leaf store, 1
I just bought my 2nd car here and have had great experiences both times. My sales person was Chris Stone on both cars (one new and one used) and he has proven to be knowledgeable and helpful. I am not familiar with the service department there as I have not had any work done there., 1
It may be cramped, 1
The best gym in Las Vegas. Been to all them this has helped me become better than I've ever been., 1
Das all you can eat hat mich noch nie entt\u00e4uscht, 1
Scored a Bally Marconi Men's oxford shoe for $7 at this location. Shoe had no scratches and minor scuffs.  I check this location, 1
don't make a reservation.  don't dress up.  and for fucks sake, 1
With the string of gorgeous weather recently, 1
Eye appealing workers, 1
This is a lot like the other Starbucks' you have been to. Coffee: Yes, 1
I really enjoyed the soda shoppe atmosphere of Pike's.  We brought some friends here just for dessert and I thought it was so cute!  I had a craving for something sweet and this place was exactly what I needed.  I got a great feeling the moment I walked in the door and could see most of their desserts on display inside a glass counter.  And they sell cupcakes if you're into that fad.    We were seated right away and our waitress was awesome.  She was so sweet and very quick to bring our drinks and subsequent refills.  I ordered the chocolate, 1
coffee, 1
When we order Indian, 1
Came here on a normal weeknight with my buddies.  I looked at the menu, 1
Swung in 1am for a relleno burrito. Amazingly, 1
Hidden away in the Soho Lofts building in downtown Vegas, 1
I was really excited when I saw that Big Daddy's would be opening up by Shea and 101 ever since Bad to the Bone (at Scottsdale Promenade) closed a couple months ago and Scottsdale was lacking a good BBQ place. We tried this out on Friday and it blew me away.  When you're walking up to the place you can smell the wood fire and deliciousness. The decor makes you feel like you're down South enjoying some home cooking. The dining room style of picnic tables and the open air seating is very refreshing and even when it's night and still 80 degrees out, 1
If its cold, 1
The food is great here. Have yet to have something I didn't love. The pizza is perfect!  Can't say enough about the steak bomb, 1
I'm actually wordless in trying to start this review. I love everything about this hotel! From the pool, 1
We had a quick meal at the one in Planet Hollywood.  It was a good sandwich at a "normal" price.  So many places in Vegas are overpriced for what you get, 1
There is a line outside the door every day at lunch time. When I walk in, 1
A fairly easy airport to navigate through.  The southwest terminal can be super crowded during peak hours and peak seasons but I've enjoyed my time spent here at this particular air port.  Another great thing is that the Strip is about 3 miles from here so getting to and from is a relatively cheap cab ride and a short drive if you have a rental car.  The food selection here is decent also., 1
I found this gem on Yelp (go figure)and have taken numerous shirts, 1
This place rocks! I got the Gyoza and Oyako bowl for lunch  on Tuesday and I was immediately a fan.   The gyoza is deep fried deliciousness and comes in pork or shrimp (I think? I opted for pork) and it is BOMB!   And the Oyako was amazing, 1
Came here after reading yelp reviews and was happy I did. Great local beer selection and amazing bison burger. Back porch is relaxing place to hang out on a summer's afternoon. Service is a bit lacking in terms of warmth/friendliness, 1
I had to run here on lunch to get my oil changed and 2 tires replaced before i left on a trip the next day to Flagstaff and i couldnt be happier.  The people i spoke with over the phone were very accomodating gave me a great price and most importantly got me in and out on time to work.  I really must say i will go back here again when i get my brakes done, 1
Was here on Sunday of Labor Day weekend for Nicky Romero  [+] my favorite part about it are how the wristbands and reentry work [+] reentry is very convenient and not crowded with a line; you reenter where you exited [+] I LOVED being able to walk in and out of Tao to go to the Venetian guest pool before reentering Tao again  [-] very, 1
We LOVE this place!! I've been twice and both times were an absolute blast! The instructors are great and Brad (the General Manager) was very helpful with the reservation process. I made reservations and then had to make some changes and they were very accommodating! My only suggestion is to bring some bottles of water for after your "flight". You walk out and are VERY dry mouthed! I think for the cost, 1
Most of my friends know, 1
If you are in the Monroe street neighborhood, 1
We had a GREAT dinner here! Service was impeccable and it was just an all around nice experience. I was in the mood for some Italian and we checked out this place because we were shopping around in the Forum.  We chose to be seated at the bar, 1
My boyfriend and I got the opportunity to spend NYE at the Foundation for 2014 and it was the best New Years celebration yet! They have a spectacular view of the strip, 1
We tried FROST fir the fist time on Friday. It is hard to figure out what you want when the line is right in front of the case, 1
This is under new management!  I love these ladies!  I am not an easy customer to please.... but these ladies are just top notch! After reading the horrible reviews I was so worried about walking in here. But after seeing the sign that it was under new management I decided to try.. First my mother came in to have our eye brows waxed. They did an amazing job. Less than a few days I was back in to get a full set of nails! They were amazing!  The rhinestones stayed on my design and everything. Then the next day my mother, 1
I had heard good things about this place before I managed to go to it. My best friend would come to Edinburgh regularly for the rugby and would rave about the mussels in this restaurant. So I checked it out!  The atmosphere is really laid back and really comfortable. It's the sort of place you don't need to get really dressed up for, 1
When I am on the west side of town this is usually the place my friends and I head to for a sushi fix. Normally we get the all you can eat option and consume more food in one hour than previously believed humanly possible.  I noticed some of the other reviewers have said they felt pressured to finish their meal in an hour, 1
Fire them all you want to, 1
Avant m\u00eame de changer de cap compl\u00e8tement, 1
I need to preface this review by saying I love Mexican food. Anytime I have a choice of where I want to go out to eat, 1
I've been looking for a self doggie wash on this side of town for a long time and finally found All About Paws. Their self wash area is amazing. Everything you need is provided which is really nice. And the owner is super friendly, 1
Attentive staff great food great location in downtown Phoenix., 1
The sushi staff is well trained and the fish is great...especially for the price.  The tako and uni with quail egg are my favorites.  Well done chefs!, 1
Great Chinese food restaurant but a Michelin star?  Not sure about that.  The space was beautiful, 1
Ate here on friday 10/4, 1
I seriously can't believe people have given this less than 5 stars. I'd give it 10 if I could! We asked a shop owner for a great mexican restaurant and he recommended this one, 1
I grew up in the midwest, 1
I followed Jordana to R Salon when she left Snapdragon. She's awesome! Her cuts never disappoint. She's meticulous and always makes sure you leave happy., 1
My mom and I came into cornfusion a few days before my wedding to check the place out. The service was great, 1
Super friendly. Super affordable. Super clean. and I am picky., 1
I adore this place, 1
I can't believe this worked!  I'm thrilled at how well!  We were in Vegas over Memorial Day weekend to get married and had about a dozen guests.  I wanted to arrange a fun night out, 1
July 1, 1
Just had my E-350 van cleaned by Jay. I could cry I'm so happy. With five kids and what they had done to it I didn't think it was possible for the carpets to get that clean. It's like I have a new vehicle. Good price and excellent service. Will definitely be calling again., 1
So after a year hiatus due to the unfortunate experience we had, 1
La Tasca kinda gets a bad name, 1
Hooters ist eine Bar welche vor allem durch die Bedienungen hervorsticht, 1
I found this place on the way home fro a Charlotte Knights game. It was pretty late, 1
The BBQ is great at this place. Pulled pork, 1
There are slight differences in the menu from the Mt Lebo location and the Downtown.  But in general, 1
Came for Sunday brunch with a friend, 1
I just spent the evening with my new grade level teaching team at the Glendale Melting Pot for a year end celebration. What better way to end the school year than with a bunch of melted cheese and chocolate, 1
Thank you Fuego for continuing to serve outstanding food! I came for dinner on Saturday and had the short rib and I ate myself in to a coma.   The food is fantastic, 1
I bought a Groupon for a microdermabrasion. Sugar is very attentive to details and gets every centimeter of your face. The facials are customized to your needs.  Unlike most spas I've been to where they walk out of the room while your mask sits, 1
This place was amazing. Our waitress Gina knew EVERYTHING about every item on the menu. The pizza and salad was fantastic and everything that came out looked incredible. I wanted to come back a second time but didn't have time. I'll make sure to come back next time in I'm town!!!!, 1
Their sweet potato fries and the jalapeno jam... to die for. In all honesty, 1
After reading great reviews from yelp and friends I had to come over here and try it for myself! This was the second time I came here, 1
As far as subs go, 1
Zacks - good ole fashioned hamburgers. You cant beat the burgers here... as well as the prices. Good family run place that cares about the service/product they give. I always order the cheeseburger and fries, 1
My new favorite breakfast place in town. I like that you can go healthy with bananas instead of potatoes and egg whites in almost any of the dishes.  My favorite healthy item is the power wrap with chicken, 1
OMg.  The Capastrami.  Just typing it makes my mouth water.  The Capastrami IS SO GOOD!  My friends were TOTALLY RAVING about it, 1
$14 your first ride and $7 for a second.  Expensive but sooo fun!  I went twice and each time was just as much fun.  It shoots down really fast and does this huge loop and turns sideways and you get to see the strip and all the colors blend together... a really good roller coaster and it was not really short!  Try it!, 1
Once again!! An amazing experience. We came to metro with friends visiting from out of town and they LOVED it!, 1
My new favorite breakfast spot.  The breakfast burrito crepe is a must, 1
My husband and I needed a place fast after the short sale we thought we were buying fell through.  Donna got the paperwork done in 1 day and we moved in 8 days later.  What a pleasure it was not to have to stress and wait for paperwork, 1
love there juices.  a little overpriced but worth it, 1
Pros: Quick, 1
Great Studio with a great staff!! Very friendly and productive atmosphere!! Music and Dance lessons are offered, 1
Stayed at this place quite a few times over the years. Everytime I'm in Vegas for work, 1
We'd had a dinner reservation for the 4th of July at another restaurant but since we were running late, 1
Highest 4 I can give.  Why not 5 you ask??  CHOMPIES!!  But around the North Valley...Z's!!  My Wife (Very PICKY wife), 1
Awesome. Fish Tacos are the best in the city. The rest of the food is addictive and healthy. I eat there all of the time. The service is typically great and the place is very clean., 1
I am a total tattoo snob. I earned the right...I wrote a book about tattoos and edited a tattoo magazine for a couple of years. The tattoo artist who finished the Medusa on my arm lives in Houston, 1
My Favorite Thai restaurant in vegas. Really like the service and the food here. Never disappoints. Love pad thai over here., 1
This place has some great food. Try their buffalo chicken pizza. So good and has a little kick to it. I have always had good experiences here. The owner also gave us some free drink for no reason. Great atmosphere and even better food., 1
Amazing.  A foodies paradise!  I'm trying to eat my way across the menu - it will take a while since there are so many interesting dishes.   Hand made 'Frescas' - different fruit flavors daily.  Get one, 1
Two words... ALEX ROCKS! I came in today to get a memorial tattoo. I came in with a different idea then we had talked about initially. He was very nice and changed it up for me!  The whole time I was getting my tattoo, 1
I had the chance to visit Rudy's on a few occasions while visiting San Antonio so I was excited when I heard they opened an AZ location.   My only wish is that it was closer to my home.    My recommendation is to try a little bit of everything.  Brisket, 1
Sakana is simply a great place to eat.  It's small and is always busy.  The waitresses and sushi chefs greet you at the door when you arrive and thank you on your way out, 1
Great prices and even better staff. They were so helpful. I'll definitely be returning to the store- huge selection of clothes, 1
DTP is an excellent Crossfit gym for people of all fitness levels.   I have been a member of multiple Crossfit gyms in the valley. While there are many good facilities, 1
Never thought I'd encounter a hole-in-the-wall Scandinavian restaurant, 1
A lot of antiques shops can from the exterior seem a little oppressive, 1
This place is way awesome! At first i was thinking to myself SILVERTON? really? but i gave it a whirl and decided to go to TWIN CREEKS.. I must say this is one of the best steak house ive been to in Las Vegas! A favorite of mine the tomahawk T-bone is grilled to perfection at your choice. And the sauce was perfect! If you did not want to pay for a pricey meal relax in their lounge area after 8pm-close and enjoy half off tapas and martinis. I would suggest getting the stuffed mushrooms and the calamari and their sliders are way awesome! i must say for a restaurant being in the silverton i was pretty impressed., 1
A throw back dining establishment great food and atmosphere. Casual and fun it is so much more than dogs. I ordered chili dogs and fries., 1
The most esthetically pleasing tacos with a delicious list of cocktails.  Perhaps a bit overpriced, 1
Ok This is my first yelp review so bare with me...so this was my first time here @ Gordon Ramsay Steak and in Vegas for that matter... I have to start with my reservation was originally for 5:45 but after walking around for hours in the casino I asked the hostess if she could get us in early which was right around when they opened @ 4:30..  She was very nice and gave us a table.. Inside is very nice very clean and I love the way they set up the booths which is where we were seated.. They are set up so every other table is well like this ~~~~~~~~ Anywho, 1
Just had a crown made for a fractured molar.   Also had my first appointment with them for a cleaning last week.    Totally impressed with  their entire operation.  This may sound like hyperbole, 1
There are lots of reasons to come here, 1
We went to see Oliver while we in Edinburgh but did not dine before the show.   We walked out of the playhouse and directly across the street was Giuliano's.  At first, 1
Burgers here are excellent.  Split a bacon cheese burger that was nice and rare in the middle.  Good quality meat.  Crispy bacon. HUGE burger.  Very good crispy fries.    Also split a hot dog - which was a GIANT Nathan's dog.  It was wonderful, 1
This burger bar, 1
i love the nutella crepes and their macaroons...  the cakes that are on display are so beautiful!  the chocolate fountain was really nice.  the wait line was so long, 1
Pretty good healthy wraps and salads for a chain store., 1
Excellent service! Great fries! Love the protein style!, 1
Food was delicious and at a decent price. We shared the lunch special with an appetizer and had leftovers!, 1
If you are Las Vegas bound and want too see the Grand Canyon the best way to go is by Helicopter with my peeps Maverick Helicopters!!! Stamp by "MrVegasVip", 1
This sweet little shop has more antique-y inventory than new and that is perfectly fine with me. And the pricing is out of this world reasonable. Now knowing that it has been there for 8 yrs bums me out. How did I miss it?  Little shops like this get me all giddy inside. My candy shop of sorts. Vintage, 1
The birthplace of Harry Potter!  One of the highlights of our trip.  We went expecting to get just coffee and ending up eating lunch there.  Mom and I were both more than a little impressed.    I had a cafe mocha, 1
Had an AWESOME lunch at the Istanbul Grille.  It was our first time visiting, 1
Dave's had a metric tap I had been looking for when the other's didn't - Ace, 1
Came here this morning for breakfast with my friends! I'm in Vegas for the next month and was looking for something close by the house we are staying at.   Mr. Mamas is right down the street and I can't wait to go back! Their breakfast menu is very similar to most diners, 1
something are priced high others not. good if you want a funky addiction to your wardrobe, 1
Shibuya's vegetarian tasting menu is among the best, 1
I bought a dozen cupcakes last week to bring to a party. One person was strictly GF, 1
I am there nearly every night for the 8:30pm show.  Everyone on our tours is impressed with the Sirens show.  Even more when weather does not allow a show to happen, 1
Sunday night, 1
A perfect example of why Yelp sucks the soul out of me ... if this place can't get five stars then what can? It's cool because it's impossible to find in a city that outrageously promotes itself ... and much more importantly, 1
Love this place. Wish there were more locations in So. Cal or anywhere else I visit. I don't usually favor sandwiches but when I do, 1
I liked this bar/dance club.  Free pass and good house music.  I know going in there on a Monday night isn't going to make the place busy, 1
I love Randy's!  I grew up in the Midwest and places like this are plentiful.  Here in the valley, 1
One of my favorite restaurants...I love the interior, 1
The Chicken and Gyro meet are great, 1
I'm not sure I even realized this was here before tonight.  Thank goodness it is!  From time to time you just gotta have some DQ.  The kids behind the counter were pleasant, 1
This is a great addition to the restuarants at the Palazzo. Feels and tastes like NY pizza. They have a good wine list, 1
I usually visit the Manhattan Beach store, 1
2 for 1 drinks! Great service from a very friendly and fun bartender last time we were there! Been here many times before and we'll continue to go back. We like it when school's out so you don't have all the college kids crowded into the place., 1
This place never disappoints! The owners are super chill - Kalen & John, 1
I planned on seeing a movie the first time I went so I had a super good first experience at Filmbar.  We arrived about 30 min early to sit and have a cocktail or two before the movie started.  Place was pretty empty until around 10 minutes before the show started.  I like the local selection of drafts beers available at a reasonable price.  I also noticed a selection of different wines from behind the bar.  Place felt very artsy and chic perfect  for a date night.   We moved from the bar area to the theater and right away felt so comfortable.. Had my beer in one hand and sat down in some very comfortable leather seats.  Which makes me wonder why these fancy dancy big theaters don't have more comfortable seating as well? I see they do show Rocky Horror Picture Show once a month, 1
Off the strip but totally worth the walk.  Friendly staff.  Great prime rib.  Beer was good.  Prices were great. Can't beat 13.99 for king cut prime rib with a beer.  Drinks in the casino were well portioned., 1
Now I'm talkin' big salad! Always get to go, 1
Spectacular service and great food. Their filet migion was amazing and cooked EXACTLY how I wanted it. The bar also did a great job with my kettle tonic. If possible, 1
They have a good selection, 1
The pulled pork was good, 1
This is one of the best sushi places I've ever been to. Amazing fresh selections and awesome service. Great variety of drinks. Probably my favorite place to eat in Vegas  Eat the okada roll!!! There was nothing quite like that. The kobe beef was phenomenal. I had one of the best meals of my life here., 1
We have a serious lack of any Polish places in Vegas, 1
Read about the vegan friendly menu so we decided to check this place out. The wait staff was great and the food was fantastic. It is a bit pricey but it is also worth it. We will definitely be back, 1
Having my party here of over 100 ppl. My mother and I came in to eat dinner to get a feel! Well what must I say? I absolutely loved it. I have on every state in America, 1
Tacquitos weren't my favorite but the tacos and flauntas were really good. My service was great and very friendly staff. Will definitely be coming back for Mexican food made by real Mexicans., 1
I've been going to AAB&C since they were at 7th Street and Camelback next to that bar/grill (Hanratty's I think it is).  Alan is by far the nicest guy.  And what a memory!!  I went there many times in the past and stopped collecting for a few years.  When I eventually did come back, 1
Their seafood is really fresh. I like to get their Pearl Clam for $12. It's enough to split with another person. The scallion just brings out the freshness of the clam with the juices of the sea. I really like their combos as well.  I can get some duck, 1
Khoury's I make my family come here every time I visit them.  You are by far one of the best med food places I have been!  Food:  Amazing!  They make their own pita bread (you can see it rising in the oven), 1
My husband and I are new to the Charlotte.  While there are numerous places to eat, 1
This place is great.  They have so many higher end clothing items at reasonable, 1
I don't know if you can ever give a surgery 5 stars, 1
Yet another Mexican restaurant my mother dragged me off to. I thought it would be nothing worth writing home about....  ....But now I have found a Mexican restaurant I actually ENJOY, 1
I love the loft. The vibe rocks. The owner is really nice and so are the bartenders.  When I lived in Charlotte, 1
Tasting Platter (Plateau D\u00e9gustation) : well worth it but they don't let you customize "Styles" (flavors) for the predetermined meat selection.   Don't recommend the ramen. "Japanese style" uses linguini for noodles and lacks taste  Very small restaurant causing long wait times, 1
This 5-star review is STRICTLY for their jalapeno cornbread.  Can't rate on anything else because I've only had the cornbread brought to me by a coworker.  HANDS DOWN the BEST cornbread I have ever had in my life.  The combination of sweet and spicy is incredibly amazing.    I don't know about the other stuff here but I would come here just to eat the cornbread...mmm., 1
My parents and I had a delicious meal here!  I must confess the 28' crystal dragon on the back wall of the restaurant is quite captivating.  It's actually the reason we decided to dine here.  The restaurant is on the smaller side and opens directly into the casino.  However the service and layout provide a pleasant experience.    My parents aren't huge fans of sushi (ok, 1
My favorite restaurant in Madison, 1
Good NY style pizza. Good garlic knots. You should eat here., 1
The food is delicious! Also the ramen noodle spicy level is just delicious! It's a good place to go with friends and chill. Good music., 1
Who cannot like what the USO does?  This has got to be one of the nicer USO areas I've utilized in my 24 years of military service. IMHO.... this USO lounge area is way better than the US Airways "Premier" lounge area down the hall. I left there and came here instead.  Extremely courteous and helpful volunteers run the immaculate spacious area. It's a very clean and well stocked area of food and drinks., 1
Having the breakfast special. which come with two eggs, 1
Consistently good food and service...try the southwest selections or one of the Benedict's, 1
By far my favorite dive in Scottsdale! Morgan and Wendy are the best bartenders in town. If you're in Scottsdale, 1
Had the Roasted Bone Marrow Luge. Fabulous taste and texture. The service was second to none., 1
The Skinny: innovative flavors and options --- panini ice cream sandwiches anyone? I need to come back (5) Service: friendly and helpful - more than willing to provide you with samples (5) Value: steak and eggs with pepper sauce.... what???? 'Nuff said. (5)  We came in because it was my birthday and the goal was to have at least 3 desserts today. I had just finished a fondant (ie, 1
We had a small wedding reception at Serendipity 3.  The food was great - we opted to go with buffet stations and there was tons of wonderful options.  Everyone was incredibly impressed with the crab legs and pasta stations.  We also had a cake through Caesar's that was beautifully light and delicious.  The ice cream station was a huge hit as well.  The servers who worked with us at the event were prompt, 1
4 stars from me as we had an issue with the sommelier, 1
Music Vibes pretty cool. Staff chill. Kind of once in a while place. However I love the decor will definitely come back with a gang if girls here, 1
Our room was on the 22nd floor with Wynn view. As a photographer I could take pictures of Wynn dawn, 1
I had meetup group event there with my Sushi Group on 22nd of Nov. Table wasn't ready for the moment..when I already made a reservation..so I was kind of upset a little at first. But they made the table soon enough and kind of understood the only one waitress was working..because it was on Monday. When we start ordering the food..it was quick and good. Waitress and Sushimans are really kind. I can't believe we were there for 3 hours...lol :P  Even tho there was time limit..they didn't kick us out..:P  I can tell that they were trying so hard to give us better service since it's a big group of us. I really liked food there and had great time with everyone!, 1
The food is delicious and made with high quality ingredients.  I love the creative atmosphere and helpfulness of the staff!  A+ in my book!  I will be back next time I'm in town, 1
The In-N-Out of mexican food..  They wear gloves when handling your food you paid for, 1
The hilton is a great place to stay. it's north of the strip, 1
I have been taking my dogs to Misti Sue's Grooming for 10 years now. Misti trained my airedale on her table from the time he was 6 mos. old. As you know that breed is phenomenal but quite a challenge. Nevertheless, 1
Staples has a great supply of school supplies, 1
I usually find items here that I love to death for a very good price. Associates at this location have honest feedback and are fun to talk to about fashion and retail business. I've been a regular customer for nearly ten years and will probably shop here for a long time to come., 1
This is real coffee, 1
Ate there last night and it can best be summed up with.. OMG, 1
You really can't go wrong here. The food itself isn't so outstanding, 1
Sometimes a person just needs a number 1 with a chocolate shake. Later that person needs to run several miles and have a salad, 1
As far as people watching on the Strip is concerned, 1
Gotta say, 1
Been to Brat Haus at least four times now and each time there is something new to love.  first time -- sat in the Bru Haus with friends and tried some beers we had never had, 1
Consider this a real salon.  A place that you would wear makeup and decent clothes to.  I showed up in my most unflattering work outfit and I was feeling a little more than uncomfortable.     Thankfully, 1
I actually like this place a lot. The portions were generous and the food kept well in a to go container. My girl had a Groupon, 1
Can't really go wrong with chips and salsa, 1
Pretty awesome and fun :) took my mum there and she was pretty much dancing on the chair.   Talent explodes here and you truly feel the love :)  Highly recommended., 1
Delicious! Yummy! My new favorite!, 1
This Filiberto's is one of the best ___berto's in town.  In particular, 1
I am so full!  I had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with sliced pork.  I also ordered kaedama (extra noodles), 1
I had an issue with my AC unit that was connected to ventilation with my swamp cooler. One summer the AC stopped functioning and my house got very humid and I couldn't get my house cool. I tried a few 'popular' valley air conditioner repair companies and was sorely disappointed at their ability to fix my issue. After a month of headache, 1
Jason has been cleaning our car and the cars of friends for years.  I was sitting here writing reviews and I could not believe that he did not have a Yelp review, 1
I love the relaxed vibe of this place, 1
ive had retro bakery cupcakes twice and i love them.  they are delicious.  both times they were delivered.   its $49 for a dozen delivered but i think its worth it considering the ones over at the cupcake place at the venetian are about $4 each anyways.     the cake is super moist and the frosting is not toothaching-ly sweet.    the only issue i had was with delivery.  i thought they could leave it at bell desk but when the day came, 1
Guy hits it out of the park with this one! I have been there several times now and each time was as great as the first. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and toppings are on point for each variation. The truffle fries are to die for! Unfortunately I have never tried a dessert there because the entree and appetizers are such large portions there is no room. but one of these times I will skip the appetizer and get a dessert. Keep up the great work Guy my family and I love it!, 1
Came with my bestie a the kids had a blast.  Fresh food and nice young staff!   Not to bad...day after Christmas fun!, 1
I have loved The Judge ever since I drunkenly stumbled across it looking for a shortcut to Princes Street one night.  It's down an alley on the Royal Mile, 1
After booking a room for my birthday celebration, 1
First off you must consume enough sake and beer to warrant a visit to the restroom. That way you can pass through the sexy, 1
The staff is always friendly to me and they seem to really care about their job. I do like the bright interior and the music selection they play over the sound system.  I admire the fact that they try to provide food that is local and organic because it is consistently fresh and absolutely good. My favorite  is the egg salad sandwich on multi-grain bread. The pastries are also a winner and wonderfully fresh, 1
They have great food!! I ate here 3 times and tried different things every time and everything was so great. (loved loved their duck with drunken noodle)  I reduced one star because  1) little portion - 3 girls, 1
steven gave me a new set the other day, 1
Why have I never gone here before?! Descent price all around from ticket to snack bar. Place was clean and well taken care of. Employees were pleasant and helpful. The chairs..... Absolutely the best way to watch a movie even though I did fall asleep for about the first 10 minutes. Definitely will return again, 1
Old school, 1
A few underwhelming experiences of egg rolls that tasted like mushy wet newspaper, 1
Caffe Daniel is the neighborhood Italian gem that I've been searching for in central Phoenix for years. The food is fabulous, 1
I usually eat healthy 99% of the time but when I do indulge it's usually because I have some sort of emotional connection to said food and this my friends is the BOBBIE.  The sandwich has a special place in my heart. Coming home after school or from playing in the park my mom would sometimes bring home this magically, 1
The BEST salsa lives here!  The restaurant is very clean, 1
mmmmm pie! it was nice to go with a group and get a few slices to split between all of us. Some were more creamy/chocolate lovers while others liked the fruity stuff, 1
I see tons of great reviews for their waxing services, 1
SanTan Brewery in downtown Chandler is a great place to enjoy fantastic beer at low prices. Opened in 2007 and located in historic downtown Chandler, 1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this mountain! Parking for both trails i've hiked on are a little tight. Echo Canyon Trail off of Tatum & McDonald is pretty hard. The parking lot used to be super small and if you had a bigger car then your luck of finding a parking spot was very slim. I've hiked that trail twice and I will tell you now if you're just getting into hiking I don't recommend hiking Echo Canyon trail! There is a ton ton of steps to get up the mountain and then when the steps end it is all uphill where you have to climb pretty moderate/small rocks to even to get to the first look out point. Getting down is even harder. The parking lot is currently being worked on so you can't even hike that trail right now so hopefully when they're done with all of the construction the parking lot will be bigger than before! The other trail, 1
Of the M&Ms and World of Cola, 1
How refreshing !!!  I had heard "chatter"   about this place and ran into it BY ACCIDENT.  I walked in and was pleasantly surprised.  Hardwood floors, 1
I am counting the days until my return to vegas (6 as I write this) one of the reasons I'm so excited to go back is a trip to Vosges.  As far as chocolate goes, 1
Genaro's puts a good twist into the ethnic restaurants in the Charlotte area. Best way I can describe Peruvian food is to combine Mexican, 1
Why did I wait so long to write this review.. I don't know. I haven't walked the breath of this wonderful piece of nature and urban mix, 1
Ever since I watched that movie Serendipity... there was a scene in the movie where they ate at a Serendipity restaurant in NY and had the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  I told myself if I ever go to NY, 1
I come here when I don't feel like driving to Sephora to pick up basics.  The store sales staff has been hit or miss as far as how helpful they are.  Overall the store has always been clean and I have been able to get in and out with the things that I need., 1
I purchased my MDX here over a year ago and can't say that I've ever had a nicer car-buying experience. Everyone from the salesman to the finance guy to the cashier at the service desk was so friendly. I go back to get my oil changed there and it is seriously the most pleasurable oil change you'll ever get., 1
Ordered an iced french caramel latte which was delicious but strong! (not necessarily a bad thing). The barista was very laid-back, 1
The food was absolutely delicious. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Very nice setting. Would recommend, 1
Great breakfast selection and a well sourced local and wholesome use of ingredients. The "Callejero Style" corn on the cob is one of the best items on their menu. The mesquite grill always delivers fantastic smells and titillates your taste buds. The Chilaquiles Verdes is my favorite breakfast selection, 1
Amazing minor/spring training field. I wish parking was free since there was a lot of space. $7 cold stone for the win., 1
This is the best Hampton Inn that I have ever stayed in. We love the magic behind the mirrors in the bathroom. The management and the staff are fantastic also. If any of our family comes to town, 1
My favorite ice cream shop, 1
We typically go for the brunch which is always fabulous. I love that they bring coffee that is French press in it's own metal carafe. Service has always been attentive and the food quality is top notch.   Not sure about some of those who've had negative experiences, 1
This is my favorite Sammy's location in town. Even after moving across town I will still make the trip if I am in the mood for it. Has a nice atmosphere and great customer service. Management has always treated my family excellent, 1
I love looking at Christmas lights.  Actually, 1
Best place for cheap craps.  The dealers are fun and friendly.  Drinks take a while to get., 1
We've lived in the Vineyards for almost 4 years now and we have really enjoyed it. Now that the boat ramp and docks are currently being built and are scheduled to be ready for boating season this year, 1
My favorite place for a date and conversation. The decor is unique since it was a restored post office. Lots of lounge and table type seating.Try the bruschetta board! I always order the sweet tomato jam and sheep's milk, 1
We really enjoyed ourselves at RSVP. The place is new so the dance floor is not overly crowded. The decor is very chic, 1
I LOVE this bar and I would go again.  The staff is super nice, 1
Service has improved significantly since my last few visits.  Wait time is shorter, 1
I go to Five Guys all the time. I like the regular fries and my girl likes the cajun. We asked the cashier and they were very nice and let us know you can order some cajun seasoning on the side and apply it to your liking. Hope this works for you!  Five Guys is the best! I used to think In-N-Out Burger was the bees knees but my opinion changed as soon as I was introduced to Five Guys. Anyone who is unsure about a new chain in this area should really take a friend (or two) and try it. You won't regret it!, 1
Cor. I tell you, 1
An intimate, 1
Do yourself a favor and get the chicken and waffles!   I've been here a few times now, 1
Its the best pho in k.w, 1
Hello Gradys!!  I am so glad Daren told us about Gradys. We ate there today and had a great little lunch. While the atmosphere is sparse and its a strip mall location, 1
After staying at the Luxor for 3 nights, 1
Say what you will about Target, 1
Amazing. If you need your roasted duck and bbq pork fix while in vegas this is the place to be.  Good, 1
After a ridiculously horrible experience at another local Gun shop I decided to check out DMPF. I was warmly welcomed and the staff showed genuine interest in answering my questions and taking the time I needed to help make an informed decision with my next firearm. .       They are ALL about customer service first. Sales will ALWAYS follow that in any business.  It is worth the trip to visit their shop!!, 1
Love cherry on top! Super friendly staff. Delicous yogurt flavors & toppings. Our fav place for yogurt in town!, 1
All Hours Plumbing saved my weekend. 2 broken toilets and a broken disposal the day after Thanksgiving!  Yikes!  Very courteous on the phone and had the guys out within hours. They even had to run out and get a part. Reasonable rates and very professional. They will be the top of my list to call for plumbing next time., 1
We stopped by last nigt and picked up a 20in. Half chesse and half pepperoni pie and a cheese garlic bread blossom. It was our first time ordering food from this place not knowing anything about this pizzeria. I don't even know where to begin, 1
I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, 1
Great food.  Great Burgers.  We always sit in the bar.  It's very typical McCormick Ranch where everyone is very old (Think Busters...) but the food is awesome.  Great beers too., 1
The only reason this is not a five-star rating is because there is an instructor that only focuses on the 'discipline' of yoga and singles out less advanced students with use of the words like "no" "stop" and "you're wrong"  HOWEVER, 1
Love the new space, 1
I thought  the setting was gorgeous! Outside area surrounding the pool where u can take a break.  Not a lot of dance floor space and the sound system is not that great. I guess I'm  spoiled on function one ;) But the staff is SO nice and so friendly! Even when they were chastising me for wearing shades indoors they were nice about it. Not like those DICKS at marquee. I hate that place.  But I digress... beautiful girls dancing. Overall I loved surrender but it would be better with a bigger dance floor and maybe some louder music outside around the pool. But I had virtually no wait for drinks and even the patrons themselves of this club were awesome.  A classy place., 1
There are a few bars to choose from in Mt. Washington, 1
I guess I'll write this one simply and leave out the Bourdain commentary.  I found not one thing wrong with this place.  I've only had a chance once in my 27 years to have authentic Chinese food.  I was at a friends house and they had someone visiting from China and cooked us a full course meal with some tasty recipes.   My meal here reminded me of that day.     This place was great on the inside.  Tall ceilings, 1
What a goddamn bummer this gym has permanently closed.  For all the griping about "old equipment" it really was the only serious spacious hardcore bodybuilder gym near the Strip, 1
Very good! Nice and warm welcome by friendly and pretty girl.  Drinks tasted great.  Priced fair.  Quality fresh.  Vast selections.  Too bad the spot was right next to a sleazy looking massage parlor and another shop squishing this place in between and felt the outside is kind of dirty.  Must be because lack of a patio or even a "sidewalk."  Will definitely go back.  Maybe try their snacks., 1
Staff was incredibly friendly and eager to have us try multiple popcorn samples once I explained it was our first visit.  I really enjoyed the white cheddar and loaded baked potato, 1
Loved it. Was tired when we arrived so we relaxed in our room & ordered room service - which was delicious.  After resting we got out and explored, 1
Always great to come here. Grea food, 1
I had the prosciutto pizza, 1
Best catfish I've had. Definitely a fan of the cajun seasoning. I've yet to eat anythng here thatisn't great. Authentic Southern dishes and service. There is a wait, 1
I think that Noodles & Company is one of my favorite "fast food" chains, 1
Came in on a Friday afternoon. Surprisingly quiet and empty, 1
I would gladly recommend Deer Creek Animal Hospital to my friends! I never feel like I'm being pressured to buy more than I need to, 1
Went here during lunch, 1
Bamboo Club is definitely a hidden gem on Mill. Thanks to my boyfriend because I would have never noticed it in it's upstairs location at the business park. This is also one of only restaurants I have been to on Mill that had a relaxing and intimate vibe.   The food is a little pricey but it was very good. The menu offers various choices of the 'Asian Bistro". My boyfriend sticks to the Orange Chicken, 1
The food was amazing. We took our restaurant.com gift card and our party of 5 for my birthday last weekend. The restaurant was quiet and nice to celebrate my birthday. We each ordered a drink (the wine was VERY reasonably priced) and a salad. The salads were great (we had the garbage salad, 1
Open all the time. Good Chinese for what it is. Could be cheaper but it's reasonable., 1
Although this place is best known for its party (they know how to throw a party like a boss), 1
Went for the first time and will go back often. Very nice choice on the menu to build your own omelet or burrito.  Healthy choices are available and food was fresh. Thanks again yelp!, 1
The food is great. have eaten there almost every month for the last year.  I really don't like the fluorescent lighting though. thats the only thing I would change., 1
Such a nice fitness center! Beautiful entrance and clean equipment. Staff is friendly and I love the free swim cap with check in. This pool is salt water so your skin won't feel dry or flakey after finishing your workout., 1
This is by far the best steakhouse that I have been too. Maybe I say this due to the lack of high end steakhouses I have been too. But everything to me here blew my mind.   One thing I want to mention is the level of service. I have never had such great service at any other restaurant than here. The food was served exactly at the same time by 4 servers, 1
Best Happy Hour in Vegas!  Hands Down.   Just perfect for happy hour or late night snack.   Trust me.   Try It.  I don't think they disappoint.   Dinner there is terrific too.  I wish I can add my pictures.  Food looks tasty.  Mouth starts watering.   Tongue does back flips., 1
I swear I was just going to have a bite.....I ended up eating more than my half of the ice cream sandwich goodness.  Home made cookies....about 8 or more different types.  We tried the white chocolate macadamia nut and chocolate chip with walnut....and both were good but I preferred the chocolate chip with walnut since it wasn't quite as sweet.  They serve Thrifty ice cream, 1
This is the my favorite casino I have spent time at in Vegas. That is saying quite a bit, 1
Nick's is a small local chain that does a lot of things right. The portions and service are just right, 1
Pretty good, 1
I think this Starbucks had great customer service and I was in and out of the drive thru in 5 mins. When does that ever happen??, 1
Fast and easy.  $10 coupon on yelp was great!, 1
Thousands of miles on three sets of tires and every visit for the "free" rotation and balance has come with prompt and polite service.  No hidden or extra costs.  On two occasions I needed a new valve stem and other occasions I needed rebalance.  No questions asked and no charge.  How many places can you take a vehicle and have service performed with no charge?  The new tire service has been outstanding every time with honest deals.  At most I have had to wait 45 minutes to an hour plus can walk across the street to Best Buy to cool off and check out the latest in electronics.  No need to throw the tire thru the window!!!, 1
I have been going to Inferno Hot Pilates for almost 1year. I was having a hard time loosing that stubborn 10-15 lbs & the cyclone spin 45 min class really helped bump up that extra burn I needed. It's a fun class if you like to jam to music, 1
I like this place. I don't get there often, 1
Customer service is over the top.  They remember your name, 1
Wew had a pedi at Sundrops and then a drink or two at the Grind. I thought it was a coffee shop. We had the wings, 1
My buddies and I came here for one of my best friend's bachelor party lunch, 1
LOVE GR! so, 1
I went to this music venue to see "Dave Matthews Band" last year and I had an awesome time.  The crowd there was massive and everyone seated around my section was very friendly.  Then again, 1
I was skeptical about this place... Great coffee in the US? Blown away. Perfect espresso from a guy who looked absolutely exhausted on a black Friday makes me excited to come back when he's well rested.  Friend also manage to score almond milk lattes. What a treat! Fun decor, 1
After a long vacation and drive from San Fran to LA to Vegas ending up at Aloha Specialties made me feel like I arrived back home on Oahu.  Seeing all the local people, 1
An experience through and through!  I love feeling like you disappeared into a different world, 1
One of the few foods that I really love but can hardly ever find in Montreal is really good Southern Fried Chicken. Well, 1
Brought some cds in to sell.  Got a little more than I expected, 1
Live music, 1
I like this park...it's very close to our house.  Our dogs like playing in the big dog area here.  Benefits:  east to get to location, 1
My cat has the herpes. The Herpes! And before you go slandering her good character, 1
Love their fresh fish section..open late and friendly service, 1
Great food!  Love the mole options!  and very good margaritas. The chips are addictive. And the service is quick, 1
We went with Groupon, 1
One of the 3 best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix 1. Phoenix Palace  2. Great Wall 3. Golden Buddha Try the crabs, 1
I am not one to hyperbolize but Hiro Sushi is the best sushi that I have been able to find in the valley. The food here is fresh, 1
I took my wife last Friday night to celebrate our 22nd anniversary and had a fabulous evening! Pavle made us feel like family and the food was delicious and unique. The Pinot Noir we had was so good we joined the wineries mailing list. Highly Recommend!, 1
"Come on guys" whines my Midwest poker bud as a bowl of soup, 1
My go to spot for breakfast/brunch. Chompie's isn't trendy, 1
Food was great and the staff was awesome. I have to say that this location is better than the Sherman Oaks location due to the bigger venue and shorter wait time... Parking is also better., 1
Went here for dinner a few nights ago. Very cool interior and friendly staff from hostesses to food runners. Our server Matthew was terrific and had good recommendations. Seafood linguine and Spanish risotto were great. They comped a nice dessert since we were first-timers. Had a great meal and overall great experience. Well worth the drive over from the west side., 1
My weekly stopping place!  I love that it is small, 1
This is now my primary vet (formerly Aloha Animal Hospital).   They can always see me right away and I'm the kind of dog-mommy that needs to know all the details about what's wrong, 1
The food and wine was absolutely phenomenal, 1
Love Love Love this place! I had a 2 week trial membership and so wish I could go full-time!  The people here are wonderful!  The cleanliness, 1
I do love to rip Sam Fox places, 1
let a tip. check it out. this is my first time using Yelp and thought I was writing a review., 1
A solid four stars. This place is set up like a embassy suites (maybe it was in a former life) with an open atrium. Nice front counter folks, 1
Pacific has been our go-to buffet since 2006. This location consistently delivers good food and good service...especially if Lisa is your server. Id give it 5 stars but it is a buffet and the quality decreases a bit between 3-4pm when they are switching from lunch to dinner. The sushi is great.I like the variety of deep fried to specialty to hand rolls to nigiri. Always of good quality. The mongolian grill is a nice addition although I'm usually too busy eating sushi to take advantage of it. Salad bar options are a little weak, 1
Had a wonderful experience working with Myra. Came across her website online and was looking for a home in my price range in the queen, 1
Good ol' Duke's! This place is a standard for us. We go there often and LOVE trivia with Darel! Service is hit or miss. Some times we have great service, 1
Love this place!  Everyones very welcoming and it seems to do everything!  Cafe, 1
This Walgreens is awesome. It's like no other. They sell booze and shit. It's awesome. This is the go to place to buy all you're shit while In Vegas. You can buy booze, 1
Most fun in 4 hrs that I've ever had ! Took my sister and her friend when they came to town and ended up doing 2 nights in a row ! These guys are so funny and keep the crowd on its toes the whole time . I do suggest that u get there before 10pm to get a table because even on sun and mon night when we were there it got pretty full . Thank you Dave Mauk for 2 great nights !, 1
This was 1 of the 2 meals I had over EDC weekend and let me tell you... It was some of THE BEST PHO I've ever had!!!!!! We came in a group of 8 (automatic gratuity) and were seated immediately. Waters came out quickly and we got our orders and food almost instantly as well. The waiter seemed to rush us a bit but hey, 1
4 1/2 stars Always a pleasure. I've been to DW about 10 times now for brunch and it's a winner. The jerk pork hash is scrumptious. Shredded pork and big potato chunks with tasty seasonings topped with a perfectly cooked egg and served with warm tortillas equals yummy brunch food in my book. This particular item is only $7 and is a generous portion!  The bloody marys have a slice of jalape\u00f1o bacon along with the traditional garnishes. Genius!  The turkey burger is also excellent. It is moist and tasty with a sweet mango raisin chutney on a chewy egg bun. The burger is served with sweet and salty sweet potato fries and a zesty aioli for dipping. Yum. I think it's $12.  Haven't made it in for dinner yet but brunch on the patio is fabulous.  Decor is very cute and service is very friendly and accommodating., 1
The fact that offerings are limited means selection is expanded....so many different oils and vinegars. I also love that they come in a 100ml size (as well as larger bottles) so we can keep a variety on hand. I use fish sauce in many of my favorite Asian soups, 1
There pizza is amazing and homemade Ordered take out and it was made in about 20 to 25 mins. Have never ate in the restaurant but when I went and picked up our food, 1
Tons of people have hyped up the Wynn Buffet to me... It did not disappoint. Prime rib, 1
Ahh a good Thai place kinda close to our house! I love that this place is small. The service is great and the food is wonderful. What do I recommend? Drunken Noodles. I haven't had Drunken Noodles like this in SUCHA long time. We only tried two dishes but we will def try different ones each time we go. They have soy "meat" which is kinda cool because it's a good alternative to tofu. Same owners as Thai Cuisine - which I also approve of. We will def be back., 1
I can't say enough about Helen and her team at Alligator Soup! From start to finish, 1
Don't bother me. I'm in my happy place., 1
Dr. Sandeep Patel is the most amazing doctor.  He makes you feel so comfortable about things and always has a smile.  Wonderful office staff also.  Two thumbs up., 1
Duckworth's is a great place to go and grab a unique craft beer and some good bar food with friends or colleagues after work. It is also a good place to catch a game, 1
I've been going to Dr. Khalek for years and he's great!, 1
When you're strapped for cash...this is the place to go.  It is usually pretty crowded so put your big girl panties on and be patient., 1
Try the mr. Lucky's slot machine in the D terminal. It's my favorite slot machine. Its also my favorite airport because its in my favorite city.. LAS VEGAS!   Plenty of eating choices to choose from, 1
Their prices are reasonable -- considering that it's a specialty grocery store. Wish it was located closer to my neck of the woods!  I passed this grocery store on my way to another destination, 1
Only Eastern North Carolina BBQ gets five stars, 1
Cool local reef store in a warehouse. Cool staff with a variety of selections. Prices are on par with the industry., 1
Went for the buffet. Great meat and veg choices. The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I will be back., 1
Wow! talk about roll back prices....$1.75 wells, 1
This is one of my favorite Hotels in Vegas! Always encourage my friends and family to try it out atleast one/two nights of their stay!   The casino is just the right size--not too big and not too small. The poker room isn't the greatest but its not the worst either! If you are gambling, 1
I'm a huge fan of Hertz.  As a Gold Member, 1
I have a couple of quirky friends I meet up with once a month or so, 1
I love checking out new places, 1
Delicious, 1
I love this place! You've got to go if you haven't been.  Go for the whole experience: Chicken, 1
I'm quite surprised at the low reviews recorded for this joint. It's actually a lot better than the measly 3.5 stars it has even though I rate it a half star more than the average.  Coming from LA where I know what's up with my Mexican fix, 1
They have pretty much everything you'd expect in Armenian market, 1
Nice little place for an afternoon glass of beer. They have some really nice glasses to drink beer out of, 1
It was my first time in Montreal and my boyfriend and I were here for a New Years. It was amazing! From the time we stepped into the restaurant (we stayed in the lounge) until the time we left. There was a set menu because of it being New Years and the food was amazing!  It was quieter and a very nice place to be for the evening. I'm also Vegan and they were able to accommodate me and the chef did an excellent job! The bartender (Ben?) and the manager(Omar) went above and beyond to make sure our stay was everything we needed it to be. The bartender was super friendly and did a great job. Omar made sure we got the best table and the best service. Thanks to all who made our visit one to remember.  Shout out to Raven who was hostess/waitress. Very friendly and we loved getting to know you. Thank you!!!!!, 1
I love the VIG and have never had anything not good there.  I can't eat cheese and decided to try the flatbread special without cheese one day and it was fantastic.  They will also do substitutions and I get the deconstructed fish taco with chicken instead.  My 75 year old parents also love the food but feel a little out of place with the young crowd.  More parking would be nice instead of valet., 1
After the epic fail at Project Pie in the MGM, 1
J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 souvent chez photo service, 1
Fun place to shop... authentic Mexican products. Amazing tortillas, 1
It's pretty rare I get excited about food. I'll eat it, 1
This is a less known thai place in Vegas. It is about 15 minute drive from the strip.   The food was awesome. Just what you expect at a thai restaurant. The service was quick. I called them and reserved  a table in advance; hence the wait time was minimal. Even otherwise, 1
Every time I am Canada I go to the Keg, 1
Cute little cupcake shop located in the Pittsburgh Public Market.  I got the Drunken Oatmeal and Hop In Lime cupcakes --- both were delicious!  I also got a bag of small cranberry filled penny-sized cookies ---- these were yummy and perfect to go with a cup of tea.  Her baked goods are very unique and the alcohol flavor is light and not overpowering., 1
My wife said let's try this new place I was hesitant to try Italian drive-through food .But I must say it was way better than the Olive Garden!, 1
Vito, 1
I have been to St. Francis twice - once for brunch and once for dinner. The brunch deserves 5 stars, 1
Love this place! Healthy, 1
Whats good ya'll? Greetings! Top of the morning to you chap! Hola! Can I get your number guuuuuurl? Wanna get serenaded tonight guuuuuuurl? DTF (down to FUN of course)?  All opening lines to conversations you could be having at this quaint coffee shop in the bustling southwest of Las Vegas.  The pistachio latte is indeed the business, 1
Popped in for brunch one day cannot fault the service or the excellent food. It's a little chilly inside so wrap up and enjoy the warm hospitality, 1
Seriously AMAZING! I hate to work something up, 1
Excellent service. Customizations are second to none. Highly recommended! Especially if you want to make your iPhone truly original., 1
Two Stars: For the Food  Two Stars: For the Funny Chef who put on the show.   ZERO Stars: For our waitress., 1
I recommend the all you can eat sushi option.  My boyfriend and I definitely ate enough to justify the cost., 1
I love the fact that this Dominos is in my backyard.  When Im in a pinch, 1
Ambiance:  Dim, 1
Breakfast Burrito is excellent. Only been here for brunch but the environment, 1
I used to come here alot, 1
Though not as true, 1
On a crisp sunny Easter Saturday we went off the beaten path in search of Easter bread. As you stroll in the Greek neighbourhood, 1
I was only here for an alumni event in the back private room. I think the bartenders were a little over extended that evening with multiple private events, 1
El Mesquite is an outstanding neighborhood spot where tradition meets plate- and the customers are the big winners. As others have mentioned, 1
Amazing food. Good service and atmosphere.  Ordered:  Onion soup - the flavor was good, 1
Yeah yeah, 1
ok i'm editing my review, 1
Went there Friday night. The wings were good. The bartenders were friendly and they had a good happy hour ($3 cocktails and domestics.) Me and the hubby played some trivia which I had never done before at a place like that with their little devices. It was my first time to a BWW and I would go back., 1
This is the best frozen yogurt around. I'm glad it's right around the corner from my house. My wife and I love this place and have been going here a lot since we found it a couple of weeks ago.   I've tried most of the flavors here. Honestly you can't go wrong but my favorites are the sea salt caramel, 1
We went in for a try because my coworker suggests it. It is good and the pho noodle price is cheapest that we have been in Pittsburgh area., 1
This is a real gem in Old Town Scottsdale. Perfect for an intimate date or hanging out with friends to chatter. The perfect place to start or end an evening...   Very charming and intimate, 1
Call me Miss Magpie, 1
Awesome customer service!  The gentleman that helped me gave me VERY detailed instructions on how the product works, 1
We frequent Flemings alot and have since they first opened.  We have ordered a variety of foods and everytime it is perfectly cooked.  The service we receive is outstanding. We have never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seated.  We haven't ever had any problems with the food or service. I think that this is a five star restaurat., 1
Bummed - this place had good salads and great soup options, 1
I have this place 3 visits before I wrote this. The fact I have come here 3 times in a row says something all in it self. They bar staff take the time to learn your name. The drinks are fairly priced. The employees are all nice and make a point to get to know you. The beer is cold. The good is good and hot. Typical bar food. The mixers strong. And the person next to you is not afraid to say hi.  I have been impressed with Phillys and if ever back in Tempe, 1
Really cool place..minus the thugs and beggars..cheap beer, 1
Have used them for tires and fixing our vehicles.  Great customer service. Best place in Surprise., 1
On our last day in Vegas for our honeymoon we were fortunate enough to run into this gem. The food was A M A Z I N G. Lucky for us it wasn't too busy. We each ordered chicken kabob, 1
Mike the manager is a great guy, 1
Enjoyed pre-theater dinner on March 6. I had the seared tuna salad, 1
Ok.I have been searching for this pizza since I vacationed in Italy back in 2010.  Pizza Brutta blew me away yesterday.  I always like to go with the margherita when trying a new, 1
I have been to different Oregano's a few times. I was excited when this location opened a few years ago because it is close to where I live. They have grown on me. When I first heard about them I knew everyone raved about how good they were. I check out the menu and was unsure of the southwestern meets Italian cuisine but the more I try it the more I like it. The flavors are great and work really well together. The Big Rig Pasta is my favorite but I also like their pizza. For lunch you can get a huge slice for like $3. Their stuffed pizza is really good but since it is baked it takes awhile. About 45 minutes to an hour but you know it is fresh and it is so worth the wait. Only thing is it isn't too good cold. I love cold left over pizza but this just turns into a big congealed mess. So bring enough people to finish it off or heat it up if you take left overs home. I took my girlfriend here the other day for lunch. She had never been before. I was nervous because she is a really good Italian cook and therefore has high standards when it comes to Italian food. She was questioning the southwestern/Italian mix like I did. I was hoping she would like it and she did. Whew. She got the Italian grinder which she was glad was called a grinder and had real cappicola ham on it. She also had a few bites of my Big Rig Pasta and liked that as well. Good we can come back and try other things. We told the waiter that it was her first time there and had never had one of their pizza cookies so he gave us one for free. That was really cool. It was also really good. Nice and soft and warm with really good vanilla ice cream on top. I didn't know they had 3 different kinds but we got the regular chocolate chip. I will definitely be bringing her back here and tagging along with her., 1
Awesome burger place. Not only does it serve some of the best burgers, 1
I'm on a quest to find the best hot wings in Phoenix; so far Teakwoods is at the top of the list - plus you get to chuck peanuts on the floor, 1
Great breakfast. Good mimosas and bloody marys. The French toast and eggs Benedict with duck was delicious. The ambiance was good too. Sit on the pAtio., 1
Here is a real review of this place.  We were visiting family over Thanksgiving who live WAY out in Goodyear and walked down to the bagel shop for breakfast one day.  The bagels are GREAT!  They have very nice looking pastries (my son had a donut but I didn't get to try it because he ate it so fast).  I had their stock coffee which was very good coupled with flavored creamer.  The wait staff was very helpful.  They also have some great looking ice cream!  The place is cramp inside but the tables outside were very roomy.  I would definitely visit again next time we come into town., 1
After reading all the great reviews for this show, 1
Great spot if you are looking for late night (or early AM) korean grub.  Walked over from Cosmo (took about 15 mins) on 12/31 10am.  Service is typical korean.  You have to holla (or push the button) to get their attention.  They understand both english and korean.  Food is good but pretty pricey.  Kalbi is $35...bulgogi is $24... But I would pay anything to get my cravings met.  The 4 stars is mainly for the availability and lack of competition for this restaurant., 1
Great donuts! Absolutely love the cinnamon twists and apple fritters. Wish I could have brought a box back to Honolulu :(, 1
Oh Vegas, 1
It's a small place, 1
The food and service was excellent.  Had the signature Grille burger and it was cooked to perfection. Everyone at the table had a great meal.  Felt a bit under dressed for lunch with jeans and a polo but they accommodated us. Food came out at the right time. Total time was about an hour for lunch.   Oh the truffle fries. They were awesome., 1
My husband and I brought my nephew here for something fun to do.  What I really enjoyed about the place is that it's pretty hands-on and caters to kids (but is still pretty fun for us adults too).  I came in here thinking that my husband would love it but my nephew and I would be bored.... but I was also under the impression that it was museum-esque with a lot of "look but don't touch" exhibits.  I was very happy that this wasn't the case :)  At the end of the day my nephew even wanted to stay longer which was awesome.  It's fun for everyone :), 1
This place was great! Sad I only have 3 breakfasts to work my way through the menu. I got the "eggs bennie"- a twist on traditional eggs Benedict with savory bread pudding instead of English muffins...it messed with my head a little bit since I'm used to sweet bread pudding, 1
Let it be known I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food. I don't like spicy food, 1
Sehr gutes Buffet, 1
great authentic chinese dishes, 1
Fig Tree is set up in beautiful home setting and we got place near fire place on request. I read about all great reviews online and reserved special time for our second anniversary. It was working day and we both got late for our reservation so we called to check if they can postpone our reservation.Staff was very friendly and they said just be here when you can! They set the mood right :) And from the moment we went there experience was wonderful. Every bite was so tasteful and unqiue flavours made our day even more special and amazing and they decorated our dessert with beautiful anniversary wishes. Would love to go back! Thanks eveyrone at Fig Tree for great time!, 1
Well what do you do you know ...Unlimited is a Gelato place  too   although they call the Gelato part "Monster Gelato " but it's really is the same place  and same servers. ...I found myself in the area with family in tow... and of course I have created little Gelato  demanding kiddos... ( you should hear them review) we stopped in to give unlimited a try .  Kids were hoping for a Nutella taste and we were delight to find 2  flavors with Hazelnut .  When we first walked in, 1
Another Meet-up of Poly's Adventures in Dining.  About 70 people at the event.  You know you ain't eating at a normal place when the first thing they give you when you walk in is a few shots from a hand sanitizer container !  The meal is basically served on a platter - there are about 5 different "stews" made with different meats ( lamb, 1
My fiance and I dined here after the Celine show on 8/21/2013 and had a lovely evening.  We both ordered the Innovation-Inspiration menu with wine pairings.  We enjoyed the majority of the courses with the notable exception of Savoy's famous artichoke & black truffle soup, 1
Just threw my brother his 30th birthday party at Marquee even though I've never been there before. It was well recommended by my friends and little brother. At any rate, 1
The restaurant met my expectations in every way. The staff were attentive and friendly and the food was well presented and tasted as you would expect for the price paid. The starter of tuna ceviche was well executed with a fantastic combination of flavours and textures. Whilst the crab liguine was absolutely delightful. The steaks were very good and cooked as requested, 1
Want great food? This is the place! I was originally turned on to Chompie's when I saw it on Man Vs Food and I have been back multiple times. The Original sliders are the best! They are full of flavor and you will be more than satisfied with the taste and amount of food offered.  I have had all the sliders and Original are the best. That said, 1
I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of Mediterranean food in Vegas, 1
This is our favorite sushi place to go with the family, 1
I tucking love this place!   My dining companion had been talking up the Tuck for a month before we finally got the opportunity to check it out. Nestled in a converted home in Phoenix's historic Coronado district the ambiance is relaxed yet upscale. But to be honest I had worked myself up into such a frenzy of culinary anticipation I wouldn't have cared if it was located behind a Food City in Apache Junction.   The staff was incredibly friendly but they picked up on the first date vibe we were putting out and kept their distance. The only exception was when I spazzed out and knocked a glass votive off the wall, 1
My son and I tried the pulled pork, 1
Disclaimer: Didn't stay/ didn't gamble but..... loved this place. I love the decor and fresh flowers and open non smokey spaciousness of it. The staff was very friendly and I will definitely return here to hang out and perhaps spend a  night or two. The location is only perfect and the variety of restaurants and lounges fit every taste. I think this place is well done and I feel hip being there., 1
I would come back to try more dishes! Had the beef see ewe n Singapore noodle, 1
Decided to try this place for the breakfast burritos. They are served all day, 1
I actually like this place: Only because of the attentive staff and the dishes were quite tasty! The ambiance is Terrible.  If you Love to eat...knowledgeable and particular about your Foods, 1
I like to think of TJ Maxx as an expensive version of Ross. I'm loathe to pay over $10 for a shirt, 1
Being that I am a New Orleans native, 1
I visited Delux in my search for a replacement for Induldge, 1
The Burrata Pomodoro (build it yourself Bruschetta) was enough to come back. Add the Caprese sandwich and the Greek pasta and you have an amazing dinner with leftovers because these are good sized portions. Jared and his crew were real and friendly people that wanted you to enjoy yourself, 1
Never been to the Wynn before so as a first timer it was pretty nice. I keep feeling that each new hotel that goes up just has to outdo the last one by a little bit. I guess Wynn succeeded. I liked the floral walkway from the entrance into the hotel's shopping area. Since we didn't stay there I can only review the areas I did visit -- the shopping area and the public areas of the hotel. I'm not sure why they put all their security guys in purple jackets. It just threw me off. I'd expect that at the Rio, 1
Best mall in Arizona! There's almost anything a Fashionista could ever want: Barney's, 1
I've stayed at this resort twice. My visits were in April of 2012 and April of 2013. The Links Resort is a nice, 1
Sugar Factory!! I went to last vegas last year to go to SEMA with my Hubby, 1

Great shopping experience in Cole Haan. the salesgirl was really nice and patient with me. The shoes and hang bags are more seasonal than New York. the shoe in fifth ave and soho only display staffs are for senior or mid-age rich people. Las Vegas definitely a fashion heaven. Love the boots and shoes, 1
With proteins accounted for and rounds made of the art show my next stop was dessert and although there were other choices available the only logical choice in my mind was Mamma Toledo's, 1
Maggianos is a family atmosphere restaurant, 1

I moved to Arizona 2 years ago and finally I found Mijana best Lebanese food ever in Arizona I go over there 3 times a week, 1
OMG!  I have to say this is hands down the best resort I've ever stayed!!!  I felt very relaxed when I left.    10+different pools, 1
There's nothing wrong with 3 stars! It's good, 1
Went there again and this time sat in the bar. Love it! Me and a friend had salads that were excellent. Really good! The service was very friendly and prompt. This place is really on track! I can really recommend them!, 1
It's almost not fair to describe a specific meal here because the menu changes and you cannot be assured to find whatever is described; you CAN, 1
Amazing place!!! Great place great food. Greg was very gracious and went out of his way to assist us and our friend., 1
I have stayed here a few times over the years and I will say it never lets me down. The price is right for the clean modern rooms, 1
I am a fan- I think the prices are a bit high for what you get but that is just me... also- tortillas but no corn bread with barbecue?! It is odd. I do like their drinks alot here though., 1
Had to stop cause I was craving it since my friends back in SF were posting their cravings for Pupusas all over FB!! So, 1
Gyro was great, 1
Special thanks to Chef Rodriguez for his gracious hosptality and most wonderful meal. @Vic_n_Anthonys steakhouse located in downtown #Vegas' newly renovated Gold tower at the @GoldenNuggetLV Hotel & Casino   We had a reservation for 7pm and were seated immediately. The dining room was very elegant with beautiful stained glass ceiling, 1
Pretty affordable and the popcorn was delicious. I got a mix of banana pudding/dark chocolate omg it was amazing. Chicago was great too! Also tried garlic parm which was pretty good but not my fav. Then candied strawberry mixed with creamy cheesecake. Also very good! The specialty chocolates are a little pricey but the rest are really affordable., 1
It was nice here.  Love it hanging out with family. the servers were awesome and the food was excellent. not to mention the 3 dollars beers all day everyday. would definitely recommend this place to everyone and will come again, 1
This was the single best restaurant I visited while in Vegas. It is located at the front of the Paris Hotel & Casino on Las Vegas Blvd. While waiting at bar to be seated (about 15 min) the bar tender (Tyson N) was excellent and attentive even though he was swamped with drink orders. Once seated on the patio (across the strip from the Bilagio fountains) I watched as the fountains kept in sync with great songs by Frank Senatra, 1
Just do it for the fun.  Not terribly challenging but tons of fun for all ages.  Costumes were awesome, 1
All you can eat - just keep ordering off the menu. The rolls are great and the uni was excellent. The sushi was not as great as my favorite place but it was just as good as most sushi places, 1
officially my favorite spot in madison.  so gluten-friendly, 1
WOW. That is what I have to say about Malee's.  They know what they are doing and they did a great job at it.  We have cooked and eaten lots of Thai food and Malee's is right up there with some of the best.    From the Curry sauces, 1
The food is excellent. I highly recommend the Ancho Chili Barbecue Burrito, 1
After not eating at a Chili's for over ten years I decided to give them another try.   Really glad I did.   I have come back at least four times in two months.   Everything I have tried has been surprisingly great.    Items I have ordered on my previous visits include, 1
A fellow Yelper saw my plea and came to my rescue with Blue 32 Sports Grill. Specifically I was in search of a Monte Cristo sandwich. Okay, 1
Great burgers and beer selection. A lot of people like the chips they serve with the sandwiches but I'm not a fan. On a few of the times I've visited it's gotten pretty cramped inside, 1
this place is swank. big, 1
Every item we ordered was delicious and memorable. In fact, 1
Just as everyone has said, 1
extremely friendly staff. a clean modern environment. we sat at the bar & watched the chefs & bartenders create art with the food and drinks served. a bit pricy especially for small serving portions but everything tasted great. we had crab rolls, 1
After visiting the Imagines Exhibit Gallery, 1
We eat here for lunch quite often and love the food! Service is great and the dishes are always on the spot when we eat here....highly recommend!, 1
I've been to Armitage several times for dinner and wine but went for the first time for brunch this week.  Their brunch menu has everything from pancakes, 1
Honestly its not a Boiling Crab! But thats why its called Angry Crab Shack, 1
Now THIS is a Mexican restaurant! (Not just a glorified taco and burrito making machine!) Atmosphere is sophisticated but unpretentious. Great drinks, 1
A cancer free celebration dinner!  Awesome possum this buffet was. So many options to choose from and for my fellow dinner guests, 1
This place is a trip! I love the cooks and the owner! True east coaster. First off we get here during lunch rush hour and there is literally a line out the door. So in my freinds infinite wisdom he asked the Owner "What's good here" the owner responds "Are you serious?! I don't have time for this and throws him a menu and says "It's all good..when you're ready to order get back in line" hahaha love it!" I ordered two slice... should of got one, 1
I love a good chocolate malt shake, 1
Love this place and I'm and old guy. My daughter took me here great food bizarre scene (crazy) fun and I'm coming back, 1
Love this place. Great quality food, 1
Guess cause I'm an out of towner I heart this place to pieces. I was staying at Planet Hollywood and after being checked in my bf and I come downstairs to walk the strip and come to find we are right on top of a freakin mall. GTFOH! So the whole week we stayed in Vegas we attempted to find our way around this maze of a mall and got lost every single time. It got to be a little overwhelming after a while, 1
Food Report: If I hadn't started with the salad I would have enjoyed my meal much more - the salad had a slight fishy flavor... and I don't like fish. On the flip side, 1
Set Jet is undeniably an amazing experience all around, 1
this is by far the best pottery painting studio.  My daughter and I have been painting with them through three locations.  It is one of our very favorite places to spend time together, 1
This Ace Hardware Store has everything you need with great selections and prices.  Friendly employees and you are in and out.  Ace Hardware Yay! I'm a fan., 1
I feel like this place has been severely underrated, 1
Everything leading up to the massage is a little unorganized. There is no receptionist so it is difficult to make the appointment. You have to wait to be picked up in the hotel lobby. There is no spa associated with this massage room, 1
As Gabi likes to regularly point out to me, 1
Keep in mind that each time I went, 1
This store is truly a gem when it comes to men's underwear. Love it! The selection is amazing and I never leave empty handed. Dan and his team are super friendly and know their brands. Thank you again for the great shopping experience!, 1
Filibertos is awesome as always...but I must admit this location came as such random surprise to me...there is no drive-thru to begin. When you walk in you have an arcade to your left, 1
O M F G  I just had a killer burger... Try the Smokehouse. It is a 9oz hand pattied burger grilled as you wish with cheddar, 1
I love niche restaurants. The kind that basically do one thing, 1
There's gotta be a reason why in 2 weeks, 1
I'm not really a Mimi's fan but my husband had never been so we decided to come here for brunch. Food was excellent and our server was very attentive. I'm not giving 5 stars because, 1
Like others said, 1
I went to Tommy Bahama's Restaurant at Town Center couple time with my best friend for lunch. I was really like the decoration and the foods are amazing. My favorite dish is Crab cake. The sause that they used on crab cake dish is diffrent from the other restaurants. Its like the asian sweet chilli sauce and olive oil with a little bit lime juice. Icouldn't stop dip on the sauce. I also like ceasar salad. It's very good size for lunch. The server was very nice and cute. I always stop there when I go shopping with my girlfriend., 1
Chocolate covered marsh-mellow fluff in my face. I love this place!  The staff has been very friendly on my visit, 1
Solid diner with rock bottom prices. Kitschy atmosphere, 1
Nicest hotel!!! I'm just very satisfied with most things in the room and the hotel. Personally I don't like people cleaning up my room while I stay in the hotel, 1
Super nice staff, 1
My wife took me to Mezzo on a Sunday evening. We arrived and there were only a few tables occupied ( it was after 8pm). We were seated and our waiter gave us our menus. And the we waited...probably a bit longer than we should have, 1
We went here for the first time tonight and it was awesome! We each had the carne asada tacos and split a carne asada quesadilla, 1
Visited my 1st Potbelly location in DC and thought it was a mom and pop restaurant.  I was actually excited to see them opening here when I came back from that trip.  Simple review - great food and great service. Subway is so bland by comparison, 1
anyone who's either mexican or is married to someone who's mexican knows one of the world's great hidden truths: mexicans love chinese food. maybe it's the fact that historucally mexico has had a high amount of chinese immigrants (mexicali, 1
Better than most PF's I have eaten at in CA. Decent service and the food is good., 1
On the outskirts of town, 1
Rave is the newest and best movie theater in Vegas bar none. All screens are digital projection. The sound and picture quality are unrivaled. The stadium-style seating is comfy with plenty of leg room. Prices, 1
Amazing food selection, 1
I've been to the 'dise plenty of times, 1
Best kept secret in Biltmore area. Everything was excellent. We came with a newborn and the restaurant was quiet enough that she slept all the way through dinner. Our party was very surprised at such a great meal in an Embassy Suites Hotel. Which by the way was a great place to stay. Very clean reasonably priced and facilities not too spread out., 1
Great onion rings and delicious burgers!, 1
My girlfriends parents used their points so we could stay at the Hilton. It is a great place to stay if you get suite. We had a kitchen and a big bed, 1
I think the piano and the older crowd give this gay bar a bad rap.  My friend Jeff and I like it a lot nevertheless -- probably because it makes us feel 21.  It's become a Sunday day drinking outpost for us. It's a great space in Park Central Mall featuring:  * a granite "J" shaped bar * a living area with black leather sofas, 1
Four of us from Level Green, 1
Arancini. Amazing. Risotto and mozzarella-what's not to like? Great relaxing atmosphere, 1
This place is fantastic! Great food, 1
Low key atmosphere, 1
I am not a big fan of buffets myself but we go to tin tin on a regular basis specifically for the crab legs. The great thing about tin tin is that they realize that people go there just for the crab and they keep two hotel pans full of crab at all times. Most other buffet's that have crab legs really slack on getting them out. Needless to say tin tin is worth the cost. Some of there other items on the buffet are pretty good as well. they always have an array of decent sushi, 1
I grew up hiking this mountain and my dad lived down the street. There are various trails, 1
The Hubs and his mom and dad andI all went here on Saturday night. Its walking distance from their house and we go here a few times a year.  I like going on Fridays much better because they have a great fried fish that is only unfortunatly sold on Fridays :( This time around I ordered the chopped steak, 1
Good sushi and great main dishes. They have a Teppanyaki area as well that looks great. We used a living social coupon that helped reduce the $30.00 ticket to 14.00.  So great value. Just a bit slow.  Also try the red bean ice cream its wonderful., 1
When my fiance proposed to me, 1
I welcome any Trader Joe's in my life, 1
Wow! Wonderful customer service.  I went in to redeem a groupon for a oil change and tire rotation. The employee's were very professional and even gave me a tour of the waiting area (where the water, 1
Came here for a quick sandwich while in town for business. It looked modest from the outside and I was SHOCKED at how delicious the sandwiches were. The next day, 1
Thank you Yelp.com for helping my husband and I find this restaurant. I have been turning to Yelp more often when we run out of ideas for what to eat. It is amazing how important reviews are.   I would give this place 3.75 stars, 1
Truly as good as it gets!!    5 Stars because... - the 360 degree view seating provides a more intimate feel - they didn't try to "cover" any of the songs and used real clips of the Beatles songs (if it ain't broke, 1
Lie absolutely LOVED this place! There was a HUGE selection, 1
We came as a group for lunch.  Service was good, 1
Don't know what's going on with the star rating here, 1
Absolutely incredible this place is. The food is so fresh they grow it mostly on the farm there. Sashimi grade tuna sandwich was out of this world. Great place to bring out of town guests., 1
Fast friendly service and fresh food.  Orange chicken Is always the bomb., 1
Ooooh this place. Ooooooooooohhh my goodness this place. So. So. So nutty and wonderful. This is where I take everyone that is visiting Pittsburgh. Definitely best on a Thursday, 1
When you are trying to find a place to help you sober up, 1
I didn't plan on going at a point where there were no lines but I did. I got there at 9:00am on a weekday and apparently I missed rush hour. After half and hour while I was eating my meal droves of people started showing up and standing in line to be seated. I caught this on the TV a few days before I went to Vegas but only a few highlights - about how it's a must visit when in Vegas.   The chicken was partially soggy and a bit on the dry side inside. It looked tasty on the yelp pictures but fell a little flat. See pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ?select=Okd3l50AsallpQbXgs23UA There are many better plates that I see now in hindsight like the eggs Benedict or venison sausage.  I'll be back for sure. It's 5 minutes from my Aunts house and perhaps I'll convince a few of my family members to try it.    For those on THE STRIP there is another location at the Imperial Palace., 1
Shocker, 1
A jewel of Phoenix with a vast selection of books, 1
There are 2 locations and this is the location that you would want to go to. Staffs are always friendly regardless of how busy they are. When they get super busy the service can become a little slow, 1
The food is excellent and the service is perhaps the best I have gotten anywhere. The wait staff is very attentive. When I finished my first glass of tea, 1
There is a special for $30 1 hr full body massage right now, 1
Excellent ambiance.  Fantastic service, 1
This place has top of the line pie and I take my pizza very seriously. The shroom pizza is magnificent(add bacon and chicken) . I've ordered 3 times now and my only complaint would be that they make the buffalo chicken spicier because at the moment it's not at all. TRY THIS PLACE! The fingers and dipping sauces are awesome too, 1
I ate here for breakfast with some friends yesterday morning, 1
Similar to all the other reviews, 1
Definitely a gem of a place, 1
Went there the other day with my mother.  I had the jampong (spicy korean/chinese noodle soup) it was so delicious and huge!  The staff was very friendly, 1
I ate here one evening when I was in town for a conference. Unbelievably wonderful food, 1
I lost my key during my weekend trip and realised at the middle of the night while returning. Found Jeff in Yelp and spoke to him. He was on time even at 12:00 AM Monday. I was really impressed by his work ethic. My lock was smart lock so he had to drill it and open the apartment for me. all together it was a great service. i really appreciate him coming late at night and helping me out. Thanks Jeff. Thanks Yelp., 1
Amazing new York strip, 1
I went to Morning Squeeze for the first time today. I really liked it! The booth was comfy, 1
I have never eaten a hot dog (anywhere), 1
Went here for a birthday. The food was good and the service was good, 1
Layover from Orange County, 1
Good place to grab wings and beer. I went the opening day of Man of Steal. It was crowded but not to bad. It was fun being able to play the video poker game with more then just the poeple at my table. The servers were nice and fast. Over all I like it., 1
Received a discount from a ticket booth we bought tickets to peepshow later that night. We paid $30 for 2 adult dinners and drinks. Not sure how the normal rates are but $15 per person is a steal for a prime rib buffet.The range of food was great too. The only problem is it was too freaking cold in there. It's actually a good way from keeping people from staying and over eating. Maybe bring a lite jacket if you plan on getting your money's worth?, 1
A great Chinese restaurant in Vegas.  The prices are what you would expect for dining on the strip in the Bellagio but too high.  The portions are perfect.  I had the Eggplant and it was great.  Expect to pay for rice seperately.  The interior was a bit more formal than expected but we went with jeans and dress shirts and felt comfortable., 1
Great value specially with my groupon. However I would not pay full price. They take small groups of 6 through the delmont hotel, 1
This place is amazing. I moved to AZ from Chicago 15 years ago and I missed this place. Try the Beef Sandwich dipped. The Chicago dog is amazing. French fries are perfect. If you care about healthy food, 1
I was a little apprehensive returning to another Sonic after some really bad experiences at locations in California but eating here made me a believer again. Needless to say I've been back twice since the original visit and its starting to show., 1
We tried this place on a friend's recommendation.  Glad we did!  Nice variety of menu items (some Thai and Chinese).  Favorite item was the Bangkok Shrimp, 1
Best all-over Indian grocery in and around town that I've been able to find. They have an extensive section of fruits and vegetables that are hard to find in other grocery shops, 1
How would I know there was a yummy authentic Chinese restaurant in Champaign? Thanks Yelp! Loved this place. The food was delicious and almost every table had the giant lazy susan in the middle for sharing. We had a large crowd and ordered veggie dishes, 1
I've adopted 1 cat and 2 dogs from this wonderful organization since 2010.  The volunteers are very knowledgable and are eager to offer suggestions on how to successfully introduce your new furbaby to your home.  The cat we adopted was a resident there for 3.5 years before we took him home.  3.5 YEARS!  And he was very well taken care of.  Our dogs were adopted 2 years apart and are buddies:)  I follow NevadaSPCA on FaceBook.  You can not believe the older animals they accept into their shelter and have great success adopting out.  They do a fabulous job showcasing them on social media and on their own website.  I have been involved with many animal shelters and rescues over the years, 1
Came here for a bachelorette party and was totally pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. With Vegas, 1
Great food and great service. Wish they had one on every block! Great specials $5 pitchers until 5pm Everyday! The bruschettas are the best in the area by far. This place is one of our favorites. It's hip and plenty of space for groups!, 1
Went there for lunch with a coworker. It was pretty crowd. We were sat down quickly. My chair was pretty dirty, 1
Nice vapor shop, 1
This is a great place for breakfast and lunch once more. They hired a new manager he really cracked the whip and straighten this place out, 1
This place when using their coupon is an amazing value.  I have been there twice and the food was plentiful and oh so fresh. Beware food can be real greasy at times but who is thinking about nutrition at a buffet ?    Anyway, 1
My family and relatives always come here for a late night feed.  Cheap but yummy food.  Only problem is the wait... but can't complain since people know where to get a good deal., 1
this place was wonderful, 1
i was in charge of choosing our thursday dinner, 1
I frequent often especially with out of town guests- since the outside seating is excellent for people watching as well as the Bellagio watershow.  Food is fairly priced (in the 20s for steak, 1
So found this by accident was hungry and went in. The place is clean and no fishy smell they charge by plate color and each plate has either 2 or 4 pieces of sushi   This great so you can try many different types prices range from $1 to $5 I didn't see any $5 plates most where $2 or $4.  Lunch could be had for $10 easy.   My lunch was $15 and I had 6 different items including gyoza.   I live at the base of SoMountian and will make the trek back here., 1
This was the best lunch I have ever had at Yupha's. Great service, 1
We came here because it was very close to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and because it was the least expensive hotel with a three star rating on Kayak.    The people were very nice and friendly.  The room was very clean, 1
Did you say $5 don Julio shots?????  $4 margaritas????? You can bet your *** that anytime you come here you will hear this. To me that is music to my ears! Why? Oh because I LOVE tequila. Just no gold tequila unless it's in a margarita that's okay.   Now if you are already feeling it from prior drinks elsewhere and are looking to eat this is a place to come when you have friends with you to sit upstairs and take it easy and knock some more drinks back.  Because during the time you wait depending on your waitress you might have to wait a bit you might not. Now when my friend and I went on Friday we weren't concerned really on how long it took between things until we wanted to pay for our tab. Apparently the waitress was down stairs serving as well. We easily could have ditched our tab in which my friend was saying we should do but since it was Friday the 13th I felt like we would get bad juju for something like that. So we had to search high and low for this waitress of ours and told another waitress we needed to leave right now and had to get our waitress then she came running. When you are working multiple tables on multiple levels I don't expect prompt service on a Friday night just a good place to come for drinks really because the Mac and cheese burrito is okay at best. Nothing spectacular just better drunk food then filibertos nonsense!, 1
The guys were great! On time, 1
I have stopped getting horrified at prices of any establishment inside a Las Vegas strip hotel. Yes China Poblano is a bit overpriced in the general scheme of things, 1
So the resort is great, 1
Amazing service! I needed a light installed, 1
I like the vibe of the place a lot, 1
I love this place.  I have been going since the weekend it opened, 1
4 stars for dim sum in Las Vegas, 1
One of my favorite restaurants in town, 1
I pass this place on my walk to and from work every day, 1
My girlfriend and I love this place! We've been here three times now and their crepes are consistently good, 1
Good local spot for take out. Food is good and the price is reasonable., 1
They repaired the fan on my wifes PT Cruiser last year for the tune of $500.  I was really sad when it started going out again this summer.  They repaired it again absolutely free under warranty.  So rare to find honest repair people out there.  Good job Napa!, 1
The atmosphere is very chic and contemporary with a hint of Korean tradition and culture, 1
i had a fantastic experience here. I got to the shop just before they weer about to close, 1
Excellent vegetarian Jain food.  This is probably the best thai food I have eaten.  The service is superb. The person who took the order was very patient as we had too many questions and requests ( not to put onion, 1
The casino is a little more hip than some of the others. The restaurants and clubs are nice. The spa is pretty decent. The rooms are only OKAY - nothing that special, 1
Let's be clear on what the four stars are for:  the ability to sit outside, 1
This is a review I've been meaning to write for a while, 1
The staff at this location is always on their game  . .. they are professional, 1
I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. I've probably been here more times than I can remember.  The layout of the restaurant is a bit weird. I like sitting in the section off to the side rather than where the door is. The front section is a bit cavernous and feels "warehousey" I am aware this is not a word, 1
I've been here several times and always enjoy this place.  It's tucked away in the back of a strip shopping center but is worth the effort to find for a bite to eat and a beer.  The menu is basically bar food with an Irish twist.  I like their burgers and flatbreads.  What really sets this place apart is it's amazing selection of craft beers.  They always have 10-12 selections on draught and another 10-12 in bottles.  These beers are well diversified by brewery and style.  This last visit I had an outstanding Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter.  They also offer tasting flights so you can try lots of different beers while you are there.  I'm a 49ers fan so I wish they'd tone down the Seahawks theme but I guess that's my problem!, 1
If your on the hunt for some chicken but tired of KFC and church's chicken, 1
Ive climbed Echo Canyon trail and Cholla trail over 100 times and they never disappoint. This mountain has something for everyone; 1) convenient location, 1
Dana is fantastic. I came to her looking for something to help clear up my skin. She helped clear up my soul, 1
Had an emergency and locked myself out of my garage.  Jeff and his team were at my door within 30 minutes on a Saturday morning and got the door open in no time.  Excellent service, 1
The must-gets are: thin steak w/ frites, 1
Was here just to see the sirens if TI show which was amazing., 1
I had a great experience at this place, 1
Fresh Baked Homemade delicious - Cookies. The kind that could potentially outperform your own Mother's Secret recipe. Sweet Addictions staff is uber happy and friendly the place is immaculately clean and fun Filled - May need more Tables and Chairs but they deliver the goods Insane Thrifty Ice Cream and amazing cookies, 1
There are quite a few good-looking varieties of the pasty on the menu - makes for a difficult choice. When you do make a choice, 1
Stephanie the bartender makes a damn tasty Moscow Mule. Delicious wings and gravy fries! Good stuff!, 1
Update!  After living in Madison for two years, 1
Red Robin is great. The burgers are juicy, 1
I went there first time as a walk in. My son is 14 months old and is very fussy about haircut. He doesn't let anyone even brush his hair let alone cut it. Our hair stylist was amazingly patient. And the lady at the reception (sorry I was too nervous to get their names) blew bubbles to keep my son entertained. He did cry a bit but not as bad as I thought. After I couldn't handle his crying, 1
We've eaten at Mr. Jim's quite a few times.  After having consistent good service and delicious food, 1
Anything you could think of possibly needing is here at Woodman's. Anything. Their ethnic and natural food sections are extensive. The organic produce section is adequate, 1
I loved this place. The environment, 1
AMAZING, 1
We love this place! It's near our house and has great, 1
I'm a little late to the review party but 250k people attended and 15 reviews? C'mon!!  Comeup: Too many DJs to count. Mainstream to mnml. Cops are chill. Crowd is generally friendly. Security doesn't try to extort me for my gloves. Vegas baby Vegas!  Peaking: Complete and utter brain fuck of all senses. Aural, 1
I love The Almond Tree!!! My entire bridal experience has been the absolute best!!! From picking out my gown ( the very first one I tried on ), 1
Best PHO in Vegas. I've tried maybe like six different pho restaurant and I can definitely say that Lemongrass Cafe is the best. There pho has so much flavor to it and the soup is not at all oily like some restaurants.  Serves is amazing and persistent. Love this place! I would recommend Lemongrass Cafe. Try it you won't be disappointed., 1
This place is absolutely stellar. If you have never tried it I would highly recommend it.   Protip: If you like Pizza, 1
Lovely place to eat. I've been here three times and each time was great., 1
Food 4 stars - service 5+ stars  Found this on Yelp on got there right when it opened.  Within 15 minutes the place was packed, 1
I stayed in the Augustus Tower at Caesar's over New Years and I decided to just go downstairs and scope out the spa.  This place was amazing and I've had my fair share of spa experiences in the past, 1
Cupcakes, 1
This is an Old School Chinese restaurant for sure. It has remained the same for over 20 years! The Moo Shu Pork is Awesome. I like it without the plum sauce. I always crack up when I hear about the "Flaming Platter" but it very good. This is not the best Chinese Restaurant out there I am sure, 1
My wife and i had the pleasure of dining here on 1/4/14.  We were seated right away.  The ambiance was good, 1
Cosmopolitan's new place to host shows! Bruno Mars will launch the grand opening act.  This place is Amazing, 1
This place probably has the best deal for Korean BBQ in town, 1
Would have given a five star but the $3 salad was the worst. It was just a bowl of lettuce and some chopped tomatoes. Onion rings awesome perfectly cooked. Cheeseburger great flavor. Awesome fireball shot $4.50 but $3.00 on Monday., 1
I would trade my first child for some good polenta and here my first child would have to be given up to Wolfgang Puck. We came here on our last trip to Las Vegas and were very pleased. Probably one of of the least expensive places to dine in Crystals (which still will set you back $25-$30 a plate) and it also has a nice view to people watch while you dine. We made reservations before going and were quickly seated. The server was friendly but forgettable. I didn't partake in any spirits but my iced tea was very good. Everything on the menu looked splendid but I ended up settling on the Veal Scallopini, 1
Service was awesome and the concept is brilliant. I will definitely being out of town guests to experience the new way to eat ice cream!, 1
Hiro, 1
This place is awesome very clean and it really feels and looks like a spa the only thing is that they do not have many rhinestones to choose from if you like that kind of stuff, 1
I like catering from this place for big gatherings. We usually order a pan of mixed meat and macaroni salad. Garlic noodles and spam musubi are always everyone's favorite., 1
I love this place.  They have the best bibimpap. It is huge and delicious!   They have great appetizers.  The servers are nice.  They have some BBQ meats a la carte.  I tend to find something I love at a place and always get it over and over again.  It's the bibimpap here.  If I want some pork belly and NOT AYCE KBBQ then this is where I come., 1
I disagree with the fellow two reviewers, 1
I lalalove this store. OMGosh, 1
Absolutely fabulous! Was highly recommended and they did not disappoint. We will definitely be back., 1
Layla is the best hang out place in Vegas!! You can do hookah and order food that is really good and for good prices.the service is amazing and the employes are really nice, 1
My review is for the Chinese Hot Pot only. It's the only reason to come here. We had the hot pot buffet for the first time last Friday, 1
For Chandler, 1
My dad introduced me to this little hole in the wall one day and I have to say it's fantastic!  I didn't have one thing that I didn't enjoy.  They're a little on the pricey side (I prefer to do the all you can eat sushi joints) but other than that I would definitely reccommend this place!, 1
I have visited this place several times with my family, 1
it's Fry's... I like shopping here because I feel like I'm getting a good deal on groceries. What really sets the place apart is the fuel points. 2x here 4x there. I buy gift cards for my normal monthly expenses and it gives me the fuel points I need to save upwards of a $1 on gas. We all need that! I stopped in this location for sum fuel but I noticed their parking lot had covered parking due to their use of solar. I've gotta say that impressed me. saving them money but doing good things for the environment., 1
We stay at Marriott hotels as a rule. They are consistently better than we could hope for. This location is no different.  Between helping us find the perfect restaurant for dinner last night (which with my allergies is an impressive fete indeed), 1
Some local shitty pizza place put a flyer on my door, 1
I don't love all their drinks, 1
This place was an unexpected delight. It was our first time at the hotel and we were looking for some dinner choices. A few of the restaurants were closed on Tuesday night. There were 5 of us and one of the wives is a pretty fussy eater. We were not sure if Asian food was going to work.  We checked out the menu at the desk before we decided to try this place. The service was excellent and the food was wonderful. We did mostly rolls and the gals had chicken teriyaki. All in all I would say this is a place I would definitely like to get to know better.  We will return soon!, 1
This time was awful! So why the BIG 5 stars?  Because, 1
PPlace is awesome... price . service . and ppl... all great, 1
I always love the way do my pedicures an I always get the French pink an white. Looks great as always..., 1

I go here about once every two weeks. They consistently have great quality sushi at a good price.  I love the rainbow roll and the hello kitty roll.  I also get their lunch special of 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll, 1
my kids and i love this place, 1
I had the Cuban sandwich and soup for lunch.  The soup was curry parsnip with shrimp ceviche, 1
Food is always hot and fresh.  Garlic knots are the best I have had here., 1
Great Lunch hangout.  The food is always good.  I like the Fat Man Special.  Park in the back and walk through the kitchen.  Everyone says hi and welcomes you when you walk in.  One of my favorites!, 1
fantastic view and excellent tasting menu. I am deducting one star because of the outdated decor and the furniture. There were several chairs with ripped fabric and wood chair legs got bruise and bump marks. I wish they will redecorate the place to match the view and the foods., 1
First time here and I have no problem giving them five stars.   We had wonderful service provided by Mikey and Drea.  Clayton was the chef and man can he cook. Wonderful food, 1
I only come here to get my Gel nails done, 1
This is near the office. It's the best kabob place around for the price. Even my vegetarian co-worker loves it. They have a gyros and fries meal for $5.99. It's just the right size for lunch. The side of hummus is somewhere around three bucks. It's really good and a good portion., 1
Going through my receipts from our MGM Las Vegas stay 9/8-9/11...looks as if we made an appearance here at least once a day.  We ate/drank at the bar each time.  They are hustling behind that bar...busy, 1
I loooooveeeee the Prime Rib here is very tender and tasty.   I made reservations through OpenTable to avoid waiting in line since I could get very impatient standing in a long line. So yes, 1
this is a great starbucks. I drive through at least 3 times a week always get great service. also a great place to sit and do homework, 1
Nothing like ordering a $7 corona...from a can...but BEWARE gratuity is part of the bill, 1
Since it's a new year, 1
Best service I have ever gotten at this Olive Garden. Definitely coming back if service stays at this level., 1
This club is definitely beautiful. The location is not easy to find. Plus its not a mega club with 3000 seats. There's plenty of seats. It's very intimate. I went there for a job interview actually. I scoped the place out before and it was pretty dead. Doesn't really bump till about 10pm.  The bar there is very nice with great selections. Upstairs has another beautiful bar. Plus there's private rooms that are very intimate, 1
I've been to several classes here and enjoyed each one. The instructors are attentive and knowledgeable and they really focus on teaching the exercise correctly. By which I mean they don't let me cheat, 1
True potential, 1
you should have more store like this here in Las Vegas.  Didnt expect to see Calamansi and Halo-Halo on the menu from this place.   Halo-Halo was the bomb., 1
Good food. I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga...it was bbbiigggg. Every menu item was a pretty good sized portion. For $8 I'd say it was definitely worth it. The meat was tender and flavorful. Only thing I would say is that they're food wasn't really that spicy, 1
Love the Range...great old Vegas vibe. The service is very good and they have a lounge act there most evenings. Many tables have a least a partial view of the strip. I've never had a bad steak there. The only thing I would pass on is the tuna. Their crab cakes are the best. Four of us split 2 apps, 1
The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, 1
All sushi is prepared right in front of you if you sit at the bar. The food is always fresh, 1
Don't let a good place down.  Longhorn consistently provides a good value and great food.  I had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, 1
Stayed here in NOvember when I was in Vegas and I like it. I prefer the more old school Vegas feel though as opposed to all the new properties on the strip. Cheap cheap gambling, 1
I came to Bally's this past week with a large group of people. It served us well with a decent clean room. Our tastes were varied and we managed to eat in two of the restaurants in the hotel.   I loved the Tequila Bar's food prices. The cup of chilli was actually to big as it was served in a bowl. I felt that I wasted perfectly good food. It was delicious. I did not want that amount. The only issue was the bar across the way had loud music. When I want a conversation with someone, 1
Great food. Great brew., 1
BEST turkey burger I have ever had. I want to keep going back to try all of their burgers, 1
Pretty good for a nail place in a mall :)   They did my calluses really well. The reason for a 4 star is because they don't carry a lot of OPI products, 1
Good pizza!  Price is a little high for a pie!, 1
Big fan of the new rooms, 1
Overall a nice dining experience.  The waitress/waiter were very friendly and accomodating.  We were there during restaurant week so we went with the prefix menu.   There was a good variety of items to choose from including their popular bone marrow jam.  It was good but I can only handle a few bites because it was a pretty heavy dish to start the meal.   My selections were steak tartar, 1
My friends and I are sitting at the bar at a little after 2AM and we look at each other and realize that if lived closer to this place, 1
This is a tourist attraction. It is cheap and brings you to a nice view and can be done in a pretty short period of time. The lift is a smooth ride and it gives you a brief opportunity to exchange stories with fellow travelers. As long as your expectations are reasonable, 1
Terrific food and service. Happy hour from 3-6 is totally worth it for the free children's meals and half price drinks. The french onion burger is delicious!, 1
I have been a huge fan of Chez Vous Crepes since they opened. The decor is stunning, 1
Yes y'all. I damn sprinkled my sparkle here last weekend. And it was a fantassstic time had by all :), 1
Good place to eat mexican food in Vegas ...if ur craving mexican food and are in town this is a good place and friendly service, 1
I have to agree with the rest of the users, 1
This place is amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing, 1
This is a great choice for dinner on Mill. The atmosphere is casual, 1
I don't know if this is as good as it gets because I have never been to England, 1
Enjoyed a birthday lunch here with my girlfriend.  The restaurant itself was very clean with a classy feel. We enjoyed our crab wonton and crab cake appetizers. Next, 1
I thought I was buff til I came here.. and I realized I'm weak.. you can hear me grunting and crying but I love it when it's over. It really is a good workout that targets muscles that i never even knew i had. The instructors are amazing (esp. Jamie) and I recommend this place to everyone!!, 1
Smitty is absolutely wonderful and I cant recommend him enough. He has been detailing my new Cadillac and Yukon and everytime he gets done they look amazing. Gone are the days of hassling the car wash guys for everything they missed. Smitty shows up at the office, 1
I went here on a Thursday afternoon. There were about four other people there. However I think we just got there before the rush because at least 3 other groups of people showed up after us. I had the habanero burger with sweet potato fries. The burger had the flavor of habanero but lacked the heat, 1
I am such a fan of this gym, 1
Tr\u00e8s bon brunch !, 1
Taco Bell has really improved over the years as they are simply the cheapest fast food option.  Most locations are serving up bigger portions such as their bean burritos.  Few years ago you buy a burrito and would get very little beans and taste mostly tortilla.  However, 1
Every neighbourhood deserves a place like this When I come to Montreal, 1
So let me just start by saying I adore my iPod and I use it all day at work..at the gym..while I play video games..taking a shower..taking a dump! I love my iPod! So when I dropped it off the top stairs at the gym and it hit the bottom concrete floor, 1
I'm biased, 1
I have to say things here have greatly improved since my last review. The service is much, 1
One of my favorite casinos and hotel on the strip! I've stayed at a handful of places and the MGM is still the go to classic. So, 1
When I first read the reviews to this place, 1
Who doesn't love a Primanti sandwich?!?! Each time I head to Pittsburgh, 1
This place is by far (in my opinion) the best brunch selection in Las Vegas. I would recommend trying chicken(grilled) and waffles. The service is excellent and the prices are decent. Def a must try spot if your looking to try something new., 1
Come here for brunch or early lunch otherwise you will be singing the same woes of all the other 1-3 star Yelpers. I mean how can you really hate a place that had 1/2 price bottles of wine, 1
This store is a haven for many outdoor enthusiasts to purchase equipment or to simply kill some time. The company offers great return policies and nearly guarantees 100% satisfaction or your money back! The staff are very knowledgeable about equipment as well as any questions on any local hikes in the Vegas valley. I highly suggest becoming a lifetime member for a mere 20 dollars which offers a 10% annual cash back, 1
What a surprise!   Visited here on a Monday night with a group from work.  I too was a bit hesitant given the sushi and chinese menus, 1
I really liked the experience I had at Marcellino's on Friday night.  They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.  It was good!!   But then something happened....my date gave the server his card to pay for the meal and it was brought back as not able to be processed (yikes!).  The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, 1
Recently seen his show and I've had a chance to watch him as a 10 year old kid as well. I guess you can say the nostalgia factor in watching David was more than worth it as it was a very fond memory of my father taking me to see him in Atlantic City some 14 years odd ago. Oh and he was one of the guys that "disappeared" at the end. Also got a autographed picture of him too.. time goes by way too fast.   Some of the tricks performed were classic D.C and things I did see as a kid too... the "numbers" trick, 1
Dont pass it up...jus do it \u00a1, 1
Amazing atmosphere and very friendly staff! I went with a group of 12 people and they did an acceptional job at keeping up with everyone's orders.  And of course the food was fantastic.  You must try their sushi burritos!, 1
I didn't actually attend Heriot Watt, 1
Very delicious food. The duck appetizer and duck main entree are fantastic. The pork belly appetizer is also quite good.  I ordered the halibut, 1
I love this place! I used to live right around the corner from them. The tofu paradise and choo curry with tofu are both amazing! Their spice levels are spot on. I love spicy food and cannot eat past an "8" here because it is hot, 1
No matter what you're craving, 1
Welcome to the Las Vegas Zoo, 1
I stopped here after I got my hair done next door.  All I got was green juice and it was delicious.  For some reason it's really hard to get fresh, 1
Trump hotel didn't disappoint. We were greeted with kind employees and that continued all week. The room was very nice, 1
This place is Hipster central but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I had the daily fish which was the sea bass and it was delicious!!! The reuben is also very delicious. On Sunday's they have half off bottles of wine. We ordered a nice bottle of white pinot and complimented the fish very well. The folks split a reuben sandwich and it was phenomenal. We have a high standard when it comes to deli meat and, 1
i stopped by here on my way into Vegas. I went a little shopping first at the outlet and it made me hungry. We saw this place on the way in so i decided to eat here. There's a BWW close to where i live, 1
This place is definitely unique. I haven't been here in a few years and I'm glad that I decided to re-visit today.   The diner itself is different from your ordinary food spots.  It has great lights on the inside and I get that old diner vibe with the staff wearing their uniforms.  The food is great and comes in HUGE proportions.  I ordered breakfast and recieved enough food for the entire day.   The staff are all extremely good looking which doesn't hurt either!   Overall it was great :), 1
Acacia Caf\u00e9   With its inexpensive prices, 1
Hell yes!  We loved our dinners and look forward to eating here often in the future.  Glad the decor isn't bleach boring strip mall, 1
I'll just preface this by saying this is not a place for health nuts.  That's really what I couldn't get past while here. Sure, 1
excellent service. both the pulled pork sandwich and shucks burger were excellent, 1
I absolutely love it here! Come for breakfast about once a week and its always amazing.  The service is great! Everyone is very friendly and the food is always spot on.  The spinach salad with warm bacon dressing is one of my favorite menu items!  and they make the best home fries!!, 1
I didn't know what to expect here.  But, 1
Went back for lunch yesterday. As usual loved the fries and the Italian beef was so good that I took one "to go" for tomorrow. This time they had home made potato chips and they were great!  Food is great and staff is excellent... thats  why I keep going back!, 1
Extremely complimentary to a night of drinking on Freemont.  Pizza took some time.  Lineup wasn't that long and seemed like everyone else had been patiently waiting and getting impatient.  When we did get our pizza I would say it was well worth the wait, 1
I like coming here on occasion.. as a new mom, 1
Just had a wonderful foot and back massage today. This place surpassed my expectations of a foot massage establishment.  I expected to walk into a room with chairs lined up like a nail Salon. Instead it felt like I was at a Spa with dim lights and relaxing music. The reason it wasn't a 5 star was for the same reason another reviewer wrote - loud noise from the other establishment next door. However, 1
My review will strictly be on what I ordered:  Rose Macaron - Not the greatest, 1
I booked the urbaine loft room expecting a smaller room, 1
First impressions......Unfortunately, 1
I love Olive Garden! We have been here quite a few times and the food is always delicious and consistent with other olive gardens. Cute decor and tables and restrooms are usually very clean. Hostess is always friendly and if there is a wait they manage it well. Service is spotty, 1
I really liked the stylist I had, 1
Two years ago, 1
I have been here several times and the service, 1
Great burritos. Affordable, 1
Hello!?! It's JEAN PHILLIPE!!! My eyes were just going bonkers looking at all the different chocolates that were available. The desserts were so eye catching and tons of souvenirs!!! They have food such as salads, 1
We finally made it over to check out the dessert selection at Jerry's Famous Coffee shop! I was in the mood for banana cream pie, 1
Given the high price point of the steakhouse, 1
most delicious wrap I've ever had. The owner is an absolute doll. I've seen people complain about the slow service (in america we sometimes expect everything to be so fast paced!) but Pura Vida is just one of those places you take your time and enjoy the experience, 1
I love the Wor Wonton soup. I always get it when I feel a cold coming on and it really helps me feel better., 1
My only gripe about this place is that it is so hidden away.  Actually, 1
Wow! I was more than impressed with the quality of this low budget wedding. Prices are great. I was afraid since they are doing so many weddings that we would not get the attention and cooperation we would need, 1
Five stars because it's in a fun neighborhood, 1
Montreal has many very good bakeries, 1
love the coconut milk tea mmmmm, 1
The store is a sizable Neiman's and I cannot report on anything other than the department I made a beeline for - the shoes!  I went just after Thanksgiving so there were SALES! whoop whoop whoop!  Hubs was told to find a seat and wait.  The best time to go shopping for shoes at any Neiman's is when they have the racks up.  You can and will find amazingly enough good bargains on some killer kicks.  This NM's has a big shoe department with plenty of brands and styles ranging in price from not so high to nosebleed high.  They had brands here that I've not seen at the other NM I used to frequent often.  That I liked for I got to try on brands I've seen online but wondered how they fit.    In the end I settled on a pair of chunky heeled lace up Hunter boots that I have not seen before nor since in any store.  Sale + selection = shoe bliss!  The only thing I did not like about this store is that the staff was about as dry as the desert air., 1
I travel a lot for my job and it's tough to find a great hotel, 1
Filiberto's has always been one of my favorite stops. I would not say it is the most 'authentic' mexican food I have ever had, 1
This library saved me when I was down in Urbana getting my MSW.   I went in there my first week with my mom (yes wonderful mom helped me move in when i went to grad school) and we both went "ooooooooo" and my mom even mentioned that this library put her fancy schmancy library in california to shame.   it is huge, 1
The loud, 1
Espresso was good!  Pizza was even better!  Remember the Majority of the staff is very friendly, 1
Raku is great.  There are some fantastic dishes, 1
Last night in Vegas and we were looking for something casual.  Headed next door and grabbed some seats at the bar - great view of the casino and the Steelers game on TV.  Yummy margarita, 1
i enjoyed the visit.  the lake was a pleasant surprise.  went for lunch and ordered the 1 entry with rice and beans with fried ice cream.  i thought everything was yummy and filling.  the ice cream was topped with carmel!  would go back., 1
Was here with a large group (bachelorette party) and we got the tasting menu with wine pairing.  Excellent food in general. Favorites were short rib agnolotti, 1
Whoever designed the PHX airport, 1
I went today for the second time. I love how friendly the employees are! I also love that they carry rice milk! Anywhere else the dairy free options are typically soy.  Must try is the blended chai with rice milk. SO GOOD!, 1
Carman has been cutting my hair for the last 10 years. I can always rely on great company and an outstanding haircut.  Competitive pricing on mens haircuts., 1
I hadn't been to Lux since they expanded. I have always loved the coffee and the pastries but my favorite has always been the quiche. I went in today in the afternoon and was very pleasantly surprised that the atmosphere hasn't changed, 1
I have been here two different times and both times the burgers were very tasty and juicy.  Like first review said this is located inside Chevron so the seating is limited to like 4 tables inside and I think they have a few outside. $6.50 is the magic number here where just about every burger is $6.50 with bacon added it an extra .50. So do the math Triple cheese bacon burger with fries is $7.00 add a fountain drink from Chevron is its about $8.32 same as just anywhere else you go if not cheaper.   Hot Wings are .69 a piece and I will be giving those a try very soon. They have a call in # so your items are ready when you get there. Try this location if you are near., 1
I happened to come here when it wasn't busy and I enjoyed it very much! I ended up getting a breakfast burrito with steak instead of chorizo and a roasted jalapeno. For my morning beverage pairing, 1
I really love working at at this gym for it's layout and it's environment. I really love how it's a spacious club. All the areas where you can participate in weight training are very spacious and you won't feel like you don't have enough room to walk around and breathe. This isn't the same crowd of people that you may see at LVAC, 1
Only get the pan roast.  This was my second time here and I tried the gumbo which was okay but not even close to the pan roast.  Service was friendly and very nice.  Worth the wait. Will try the clam chowder next time I go., 1
Food was pretty good. My smash fries didn't have much on them, 1
Nothing beats late night cheap food in Vegas. They deliver until 6AM (right to your hotel too)!! And they open again at 11 AM! Food quality / taste is one thing, 1
Great little spot in South Park, 1
I ended up finding out about this place from one of the sales people at subaru of las vegas. After reading some of the reviews on city search and other places I decided to give him a call. I made my appointment and on the day headed down. It's easy to get to but a little hard to find you can not see it from the street. Joe  ( the guy who runs the place ) is awesome.  I hung around and watched while he did the job. He never said I was in the way and didn't mind all my questions.  We spent the whole two hours talking. It was like hanging out with an old friend you have not seen jn a while. He did an amazing job for the right price. And from now on when my friends and family need tint this is who I am recommending., 1
Gorgeous, 1
Outside of College Football, 1
Thank goodness there is a store that carries souvenirs!!! I didn't have that  many souvenirs on my last day in Arizona so I was so relieved to come across this Hallmark Shop.  I wish I had more room in my luggage, 1
Finally an amazing Pinoy restaurant to call our own!!!  we came here on a cold december saturday night, 1
Stopped in for a quick 2-slices of pizza - always ready and then they heat it up in their ovens.  This is a cool spot to fill up a belly that is full of beer.  It is kind of like NY style pizza and the sauce is really good., 1
I thought the food was great. I had the grilled yellowfin tuna, 1
This place is close to the house with convenient hours and is clean. I think we don't have the smallest unit but it's spacious. It costs about $75. The one complaint is they make you but insurance which is not disclosed in anything we read about before going there. It's $9 a month for 2k worth of insurance which sucks., 1
The sign on this place had me pretty confused; 'Darts, 1
Holy frozen margarita batman. Tex Mex 2 will forever be remembered for the place I had my first frozen margarita. And at \u00a33.75 a damned good value one at that. Actually, 1
The sandwich is special, 1
After buying a Living Social deal for $30 my husband and I were excited to try out a new Japanese place close by. Located in Toringdon shopping center (with the Earth Fare), 1
My kids and I were looking for somewhere nearby to go bowling and stumble on flip side. The bowling prices are a little higher than your average bowling joint but for what it offers I think it's worth it. The bowling alley is very clean and new. They offer lane service and the employees are generally very friendly. The kids also had a great time at the large arcade., 1
This is one rockin' spot! Wham, 1
Very nice. Stopped in one afternoon for a couple beers. We also had the burrata as an appetizer. The arugula was fresh and bitter, 1
I had a particularly good experience while Xmas shopping here last week.  After being ignored in one of the departments, 1
If I still went to McGill I'd be here all the time... I think. The filter coffee was fresh, 1
Quite possibly the best ice cream shop ever!! The scoops are huge, 1
Park is wonderful. It's always clean and inviting. Whether you see families at BBQ grills or little ones on the equipment, 1
Great place to eat and the service is unbelievable. My wife and son live to eat here. The bugers are awesome. Everybody should have burgers and fries for breakfast, 1
I never have time to make appts in advance and because if that I never seem to be able to see the same stylist twice. At most salons this would worry me but I've never gotten a bad hair cut at modern! I live in NYC and I try to make it back to Charlotte as often as possible to get my hair done here!, 1
Son paletas estilo Michoac\u00e1n! I love this place because they always make their products with fresh ingredients. I've had their  Arroz con Leche  and Pi\u00f1a paletas. The only thing I dislike is that they have in their menu items that they "have run out of" and both times I've had to go for a second choice., 1
Talk about heavy hand on my crown!  Great service and I would definitely go again! My only complaint is I couldn't use my Yelp coupon for a free flatbread and hummus because they said I had to print it out and bring it in..... however I got it anyways and was really good., 1
Super good and very fresh tasting. I had one of the best Pannini's I have ever had here. Also the chai latte is amazing. Very casual atmosphere, 1
Just moved to North Las Vegas and oh man is it hard to find good food in this area! So happy I got to try this place out.   FOOD: Bruschetta (5 stars): Found burrata in North Las Vegas! Whatttt? And it was AMAZING!! Basically like a burrata caprese with bread on the side.  The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, 1
These looked yummy to our kids and also tasted fantastic to the kids and us grown ups!  Loved that they are frosted to order, 1
Cathy is what sells this place!  She is one of the nicest people I've met.  I felt extremely welcome and comfortable.  The facial took about 50 min to an hour and I left feeling great!  The price for a facial is very reasonable and includes steam, 1
This is a very clean and professional hotel. The location is perfect for layover at the airport. Shuttle service is fast and efficient. Front lobby is awesome the rooms are once again very clean most have balconies. I did not eat at any of the restaurants, 1
I was totally impressed with this restaurant. Me and 3 other ladies were serving jury duty and decided to eat here. We made it aware to the server that we were on a time crunch and she was extremely professional and have us perfect service. The grilled salmon that I ordered was cooked to perfection with a juicy pink center my only issue was that the portion was extremely small compared to a salad with salmon. And my favorite cocktail was their polish fix with vodka, 1
I really enjoyed the brunch I had at Bouchon when I went last year. I don't head out to Vegas often, 1
L&L here is as delicious as it is back home. I just wished their cheap asses would turn on the AC during the summer and maybe then their loud "in door" voices could be overlooked., 1
I generally prefer to go to this theater over the Fashion Square one because it has more screens/better times, 1
The atmosphere is always great. The selection is always good and there are definitely always alternating options all over the store. I find myself coming here for both lunch and dinner on a pretty regular basis. Both my coworkers and myself like to come here as often as possible because it's the healthiest option around and the most friendly atmosphere we can seem to find nearby. Some may joke that this place is called whole paycheck which it definitely can but I would much rather spend a couple extra bucks to eat here then go to fast food and feel gross after., 1
If I was to describe the Outhouse bar in one word it would be 'alternative'. Existing in a dodgy alleyway (looks like the kind of street you'd see drug deals) in the New Town, 1
I have been to this restaurants many time 20 years ago. Why? Because I like Spanish food and I have to say that food and service quality is high. It is too bad to see one or two stars in some of the reviews.  We came back to see how they are doing. So first time in 20 years, 1
One of the better boutique burger joints out there. Very simple and limited menu, 1
After seeing them on a TLC show called Fabulous Cakes we stopped by one afternoon to check them out.   Fun and colorful atmosphere with a delicious selection of cupcakes. It was quite a kick to see the same bakery we saw on the show where Carolyn and her team made their impressive sushi boat cake.  We had a mango cupcake and a red velvet cupcake. Both were creamily fantastically delicious.  And make sure to check out Fabulous Cakes on TLC or friend them on Facebook to find out when they'll be on the show again!, 1
Such a fun place!!! Food is delicious. Bottom line. Make sure to share sides so you get to try them all! Drinks are sugar filled in giant mason jars and chicken is juicy. Love the atmosphere and very worth the wait!, 1
Amazing food and I prefer the atmosphere at this location., 1
Very very good pizza, 1
We will miss you Billy. You rapid craps and $1 miller high life's will forever be in our hearts. The dealers of rapid craps were awesome!, 1
Very great place to eat!, 1
Their portion sizes are enormous.  I was part of a party of six and we ordered their nachos as an appetizer. Those nachos alone could have served as the meal. Nice selection of excellent flavored margaritas. Their chicken enchiladas were tasty, 1
See Eric L.'s review for best times to go. Situated right next to CMU and Pitt campuses, 1
Great Gyros. The ratio of meat to veggies and pita is perfect.  Nicely spiced with a great Tzatziki Sauce.  Order the fries well done and you could not ask for more.  Enjoy sitting outside during the nice weather times of year.  Sits in a "food court" plaza where every location is a restaurant so it is nice as everyone can get what they want., 1
Very cool bar! Rooftop, 1
I love this place but that is probably because I select awesome combinations for my pizza... : P Went here for lunch yesterday an as always it was really good. I recently went to the one in Central Ave too, 1
A really good sushi bar in this tro of asian restaurants in the Benihana Village.  I had lunch here during CES week and despite the large crowds, 1
In the context of this review understand that the expectations for a stay in ANY five-star Hotel are very rigid & though our overall experience quite pleasant, 1
Handlebar is my favorite bar on Mill. They have a good relaxed atmosphere with great music. It's a nice switch up from the Scottsdale club influence that seems to be taking over other bars on mill. Handle has a great beer selection and their happy hour includes half off brews. If you're looking for some food I'm a big fan of their burger and fries (roasted garlic aioli on the side). I've had questionable service a couple times but it was nothing to stop me from coming back. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for drinks on mill., 1
Went to Joyride on a Friday night. Cool vibe, 1
The special crunchy mushroom dish was outstanding.  We also tried the special roll appetizer.  The only problem was it was cut in 5 pieces and I thought my husband was going to stab my hand when I went for the 3rd piece.  Brown rice is the usual, 1
The new remodeled Tropicana is awesome!!!! The service is great and the atmosphere is feels very welcoming! The casino is just perfect not too pack and just the enough fun! Can't wait to go back!, 1
I love the concept and the food. They do a great job and the wait staff is really friendly. We had Alaskan King crab legs, 1
the Cuba Cafe is now bigger, 1
Bar food... More like restaurant quality food for a more than reasonable price. Quick service, 1
Visit here as often as I can and never been disappointed. One of my personal favorites is the Turkey and stuffing (think they only have it in certain nights). Gets pretty busy, 1
A bit sketchy at night, 1
My partner grew up eating Pizza Mart, 1
Food: Got two rolls, 1
This is a really pretty hotel. Lots of restaurants, 1
Such a fun store!  I wish I had more money to invest in the kitchen supplies, 1
Food and service were good, 1
I enjoy taking my girlfriend and her daughter to this place at least once a month for hibachi. The chef's put on a great show for kids and the hibachi is excellent. Every meal comes with Soup, 1
The food here is reasonably priced with huge portions that only I seem to finish when I go with my friends. At the one in San Diego, 1
Just go! Everything was outstanding.  The Sunday night chicken special was unbelievable. Yes order the cheese curds! Of course order a local beer!  I cant say enough good things about this place, 1
Got here early in time for the beginning of their "Not so small batch" beer release (apparently every Monday) which is awesome since we were able to interact with bartender (BTW Maggie is great! Made us out-of-town visitors feel right at home) and hang out.  Great atmosphere, 1
Not the best sushi in the world but I appreciate the value of their lunch specials as well as the charm, 1
Service and food was good for the price.  They weren't very busy, 1
Whenever I'm in Vegas with the family, 1
Was here for Valentines day dinner. As with all Vegas hotels, 1
Delicious!!!! The donuts are sooo warm and soft! Lots of different types or frosting and toppings to choose from! More on the heavier side for a donut but very good!!! Loved the caramel frosting with Oreos! Yummmmy!, 1
Stopped in here while passing through Pittsburgh without knowing anything about the city or this establishment. Like gnats, 1
Whoever thought of dipping apples in Carmel and chocolate I praise you! Sure you just made your apple a day a bit unhealthier, 1
I had a wonderful two day experience at A Harmony Nail Spa!  On day 1 I had a superb European facial from Rebecca.  I asked her what could be done about the cavernous pours in my nose.  She proceeded to do extractions that were only a touch uncomfortable but left me looking so much better.  I have very red skin in general but the redness is pretty much gone and my skin looks miles better.  Next Paula gave me the Harvest Spice Mani/Pedi at the nice Groupon price.  Whoa, 1
This place is so awesome!  The food, 1
I drove around the parking lot looking for this place, 1
Surrender was actually the best club I been to in a while in Vegas but thats mainly because they had Lil Jon on the 1s and 2's.    However, 1
I like this mall mostly because it's close to my house. It's always clean and packed with people. Parking always seems to be an easy task with the many entrances. The food court has a few decent options and I'm always walking around with an Orange Julius., 1
This couple caters to your work schedule, 1
Easy 5 stars! We showed up for a couple bagels to find out that they were sold out but had a fresh batch baking that would be done in 15 minutes. We ran to the store and returned to fresh baked bagels unlike any other bagel we've ever had..literally melt in your mouth.   I will never be able to have a store bought bagel again thanks to the bagel man.   On another note the fresh made cream cheese is the perfect accompaniment. Do yourself a favor and get the everything bagel with scallion cream cheese, 1
I just left this place a few minutes ago and couldn't wait to write a review for their awesome service.  I walked in this morning and dropped off my Jeep because it was shaking when I drove it. We went camping this past weekend and I thought I had messed up my alignment or something so I decided to take it in.  Not too long later I got a call saying my car was done, 1
Chill &. His crew have taken care of a lot of vehicles for me with never an issue top-notch highly recommend. Trust worthy, 1
For your consideration: My Ellis Island Review  There's so many things I could say about this place, 1
Yum yum and yum!! Just tried it today for lunch. The Turkey Bacon sandwich was okay. Broccoli cheese soup was pretty good (was lacking in cheese though), 1
We partied here 07/22/12. This was my third go @ Rehab.   Not much I can add to my initial review except for that it's as good as I remembered it the first two times I was here.  We had a group of 6 guys and 3 girls and got a couch by the stage area where Sean Paul performed. Our server was great. Updated us on the tab every couple hours and was friendly and personable when providing service. Once again, 1
Barley Works - which most of the local students just refer to as 'The Huether' has one of the biggest patios in the city and is absolutely packed with people from the moment the weather turns warm until it starts to get cold again in the fall.  Along with your typical selection of beer they serve a number of beers that they make right on site.   The bar is lined with big screen TV's for catching the game. Their pizzas, 1
This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first.   The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.  It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, 1
We were walking around Fremont Street for the first time and ran across this place. The food was amazing and the view of Fremont Street has to be the best there is. Our group of four ordered about 6 different tapas dishes and the sangria. Absolutely all of it was great.   Fun atmosphere, 1
Bouchon is top of our list on every Las Vegas trip. This past weekend was an interesting experience that started out bad and ended up amazing.   In town for a business/pleasure trip and decided to take the fiance and her dad here for dinner as first timers. Was expecting the same five star food and service that I have always experienced at Bouchon BUT that did not happen. Unfortunately our server was not the greatest. He made some rude and derogatory statements to both my fiance and her father. I was shocked and thought he was joking...but he wasn't. Tried to order the steak between medium-rare to medium and it came out well done.  I had the croque madame, 1
Great place off the strip. Yelp it. You wont regret it. Large portions. Wait is about 20 min. for large groups less for 2., 1
I was totally impressed with this place! It is super clean, 1
Met a friend for dinner last night at Z.  I usually get the southwestern chicken enchiladas but decided to try something new.  I got the chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin.  It had tons of flavor.  They take the tenderloin and roll it up with chorizo sausage and mozzarella cheese.  Then they have this chile cream sauce they put over it.  Just a great dish.  The chipotle salsa and chips  really good as well as you are waiting on your entree.  As usual Z made me leave a happy customer., 1
Great pizza in a new fresh environment. Really is a refreshing to see the upcoming scene downtown have such a great new staple. Even here they are going to revamp one of the restaurants in GVR to be a pizza rock as well. Looking forward to see how they fair., 1
This store has a wide selection of jewellery at moderate prices.  The stones and settings here are excellent.  The staff are friendly and have a very good knowledge of their craft. Another good reason to go here is the lifetime cleaning and repair, 1
I came in to buy a BPA water bottle with a spout. The owner was so friendly and helpful. Unlike another store I had gone to where the man working seemed to be making fun of me for requesting BPA free. This storekeeper was very nice!  He sanitized the bottle and filled it for me. Great customer service!!!  They had an excellent selection of Thrifty ice cream and so many flavors for the shaved ice. Also well stocked on candy.   It was clean and welcoming. I highly recommend if you are in the area!, 1
Quite simply the best donuts in Phoenix! Try the buttermilk, 1
I had lunch with some friends here for a soccer game a couple months ago.  The atmosphere provides a British/European flavor to it.  I've watched world cup games here before and the world cup watching atmosphere is great.  Service was excellent and the dining room waitress was attentive.  She was nice enough to switch the TV to another Champions League game for us.  I really like the fish and chips.  The only better version I've had is when I ate lunch by the sea in Ireland at a restaurant that made the fish from the morning's catch.  The chicken fingers are at or near the best I've had for that dish in Las Vegas.  The beer selection is excellent and you can get a lot of english beers that are not readily available at other bars in Las Vegas.  This bar is a great place for on-strip tourists to get a flavor of off-strip and a great place for locals.  May want to pass on this bar if you don't like crowds and it is around world cup time (especially an England game or St. Patricks day)., 1
Best place for a drug test!   This is a hair test only facility, 1
I never expected the owner to reply my review, 1
Delicious! I was pleasantly surprised by their veggie pho. I am vegan and I don't like tofu but they were great and added extra veggies!  Also I asked for no extra salt because pho is usually already salty and it came with no salt. I loved it sodium is a killer for me., 1
Fantastic quality and customer service. I have nothing but great things to say about Spa Lamar, 1
I came here because they use real fruit. We got a watermelon and a honey dew slush. We didn't get boba because last time I came here I didn't like the boba too much. It was too hard for my liking.  Two 16 oz drinks cost us $7 total. It was soooo worth it. The watermelon and Honey dew were amazing. I just wish we got a bigger size! So refreshing. Can't wait to try other flavors., 1
Studio Movie Grill was amazing! I saw the Dark Knight Rises there and I was a great experience. They had a great menu selection and the waiters were prompt in their service. I would highly recommend this theater to anyone looking for a great movie experience., 1
The service was great and the food was delicious! We will definitely be coming back again :-), 1
So my boyfriend and I come here alllll the time. It is a little hole in the wall but a hidden jem. I am a total dive bar girl and love love that it is right off the strip! We are pretty new to the Las Vegas area and I was nervous to go in at first but drove by many times and was wanting to check it out. I just didnt want to walk in and there be only regulars...it wasn't like that at all like that considering it is soo close to the strip..duh Crystal! So $1 beers is where I will start..helll yes! They have some cheap bar food too, 1
I ate here yesterday was ok.  So ok I'm going back today. I had the Brutwurst dog combo, 1
So after years of wondering what went on inside this little shop in Downtown Las Vegas I finally decided to visit on 8/1/14 FIRST FRIDAY! I walked in... the lights were low and the scent in the air was soothing. The ladies at the front desk even had a soothing voice. I looked down and looked at these bars of soap they have for sale and OH MY GAAAWD! It smelled great, 1
I cannot begin to tell you how much I LOOOOVE this place. I literally go here every weekend for brunch/lunch. On Sundays the wait time for brunch can really get up there so I recommend going on an off day or later into the afternoon. This is a great spot to sip on a mimosa, 1
Tipppp theeeee truckkkkk.....SHIT, 1
I love how the slogan here is :  "Just the right amount of wrong"  My gf and I tend to go to Vegas often because it's a quick and easy trip and the hotels are top notch for competitive prices. We booked our stay 2 months in advance and it came with $100 dining credit. We got the terrace suite with a balcony facing the bellagio fountains with the japanese washing tubs and it was an awesome experience. As for our room, 1
I've been here a few times and I could never make my dish good. Recently though, 1
Trying it tonight...will update.  UPDATE!  Had a Tuesday special 1/2 off bottles of wine which was perfect for a first time visit.  The Six Goat Cheese Stuffed Peppedews were excellent and then we moved onto the Gnocchi with Fresh Sage Butter and Roasted Vegetables along with the Angel Hair Pasta with spinach, 1
I've been looking for an Acupuncturist and Holistic healer for quite sometime because I believe our Western Medicine has some sad gliches.  My massage therapist suggested I see her after my inquiry.    Dr. Sage is a very gentle beautiful soul, 1
Always a delicious treat when we eat here. Came here with a few friends that were missing "local food" so what better place than Island Sushi & Grill. Very accommodating with the 10 friends we had, 1
I have visited the shop several times and bought useful things from here. I am seeing some of the reviews which are a bit unfair in my opinion because from a bargain shop you expect all kind of things  that are neither classy nor top-branded, 1
This is the best thai food in Phoenix and could be the best in the country. BYOB and the food takes awhile but that doesn't bother... When I had time, 1
Located on Fremont street, 1
I stay here once in a while when I come to Vegas, 1
I like going here for that special treat for my family and I. It's convenient, 1
My favorite restaurant! Tons of vegan and vegetarian options, 1
I must say, 1
I LOVE their Italian sub here.  So good!    On top of that, 1
Really nice concept!  Like a lot of other places in Scottsdale, 1
I was recently in Vegas for a wedding and the groom's parents generously treated the wedding party and family members to a reception here.  The weather was PERFECT and we were up on the rooftop deck for the night.   The patio was nice with an ample amount of chairs and tables for sitting and mingling.  On the opposite side of the bar is a stage where bands can play.  I stuck with beer for the whole weekend and here, 1
My hubby got me a gift certificate to Dolce forever ago and, 1
The Waterfront is a great place to go for shopping, 1
Went there on a Monday night around 7:30 and there was a bit of a crowd. The building itself speaks to you, 1
staff is amazing and very willing to accommodate special requests. I have become somewhat addicted to the corned beef and cabbage and i was advised that if I call in advance, 1
Recently went to Vegas and planned to visit 3 breweries in 3 days. Eliis was our first stop. Its off the strip so don't expect all the lights and glam. The beer was good, 1
Took a friend from Maine who was blown away by H&J. I had 1lb snow crab in lemon pepper and 1lb shrimp in H&J sauce. Friendly staff and casual atmosphere. Perfect place to smash some crab legs., 1
We spent two evenings at Maricopa Manor to celebrate my birthday.  Joan and Scott are relatively new owners and they do a great job.  This is truly an oasis in the uptown section of Phoenix just northwest of the corner of Camelback and Central.  The light-rail is walking distance as well as an A.J's, 1
A wonderful date night at our favorite spot in town. We opted to sit at the long counter this time to watch the action. It was cool. The only issue is that the seats were a bit tight for Big Daddy to get really comfortable and we were pretty far from the action (my fault for calling at the last minute). I loved sitting there because I like the social aspects of a community spot and it was great fun. Food was exquisite as ever (menu to follow below). We both noticed that Chef Josh (always a charmer) is placing even more emphasis on front of the house interaction. EVERYONE LOVES THAT! It makes it fun and he is so informative that the food goes to another level.  BIg Daddy and my menus combined: Amuse bouche- passion frruite gren tea w/kiwi pudding (good, 1
Everyone so often I think "wow I am hairy, 1
Tripe stew is delicious., 1
I just wanted to take the time to make an update to my last review. I feel it is not only necessary to comment on the bad but also the good.  I was contacted through Yelp by  General Manager Chris Publow who made every effort to make sure things were made right. He got me another replacement tire for one that was failing on the other side of my vehicle and did so at store cost and in addition they also fixed a nail that was in the tire that was already in the tire they fixed and that i was complaining about in my first review. The store manager of the Warm Springs location was extremely helpful and made sure that everything was taken care of to my satisfaction and I am pleased with the end result and I consider this matter resolved. This was one case where the business listened and and made things right and I am grateful to this happy resolve., 1
I had the duck with broccoli and it was excellent. The fried I've cream for dessert was really good too. The prices were good and all in all I enjoyed my lunch., 1
the best place for rich men to take you on holiday. i mean, 1
always come here for beer and alcohol, 1
Awesome service and quality products., 1
So much nicer than the one on Litchfield. Cleaner, 1
I love love Paint Nite!  It's just something different and it's fun too!   When you first arrive you checkin, 1
Had the smoothie + half a sandwich for $8.99.  Great deal!  Island Green smoothie was excellent!   Trust me, 1
Love this place... you have to get the Chicken and Waffles. Yum!, 1
Wow this place was amazing, 1
We made reservations online to buy tickets for the 90 minute tour.  Our tour was at 2PM and it was probably the worst time to have it as it was scorching hot outside and  1/2 the tour was outdoors.  At least they offered umbrellas and complimentary bottled water.  Our tour guide, 1
I go to Berridge's to find the things I don't find at Home Depot or Lowe's. They carry interesting varieties that you will not see elsewhere--more colors of bougainvillea, 1
Ecco Vino is a very classy wine bar/restaurant sitting nearby some older styles of pubs on Cockburn Street. It brings a touch of continental flavour to this part of Edinburgh, 1
This place is awesome! Expect to come for a great time & delicious food & drinks. Weekends are always packed and there's always a waiting period. I recommend their happy hour in the late afternoon where it's slower and the sangria pitcher is half off!, 1
Been a loyal customer for at least 3 years - this is my go to place for boba. Its the only place I know of that uses fresh fruits and you can even have them use splenda instead of sugar. Its in a container on the counter, 1
Chicken, 1
Stopped in randomly tonight with a couple of friends... always drive by and noticed how good it smelled but tonight was the first time I dined in... my only regret - not coming here sooner!  I had the "Ronin Burger" and was blown away. We ordered garlic salt and pepper fries, 1
Federico's is my go to fast food Mexican place! I always get a bean&cheese with potatoes, 1
I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, 1
Great family run place.  The friendly owners took their time explaining the menu and let us sample before we ordered.  It is a very unique counter type restaurant with a smallish seating area that seems to be setup for takeout.  But make no mistake, 1
First night back in Vegas after a brutal flight that left us too beat to walk out of our hotel. Resigned in advance to overpriced and mediocre factory food but was VERY pleasantly surprised with friendly, 1
I enjoy staying in Fairmont hotels.  I find them historic and luxurious, 1
We brought a group here. It was ok- I had a steak, 1
I took my five year son here since last weekend.  It is a fun place for children 12 and under.  Worth checking out.  I used a Groupon that cost $15.00 for two tickets.  Adults really do not need a ticket considering most of the entertainment is geared towards children.  Jambo has miniature golf, 1
Coming from the NJ/NY area I was pretty skeptical about a deli in a strip mall but this place really came through. It reminded me of a pizza place back home that hasn't been updated since the 90s but doesn't matter since the food is on point. I got the italian sandwich, 1
We visited Pizza Peel last night for the first time.  I have to admit that I was impressed.  I wasn't expecting a lot, 1
I have been here a few times now and I would go back again.  The food has not been a disappointment. The Rock Shrimp Tempura and every roll I have had was very fresh.  The server was GREAT the first time.  Everything was prompt and he explained everything politely.  The second time our server was nice but was never there and barely spoke to us.  That is okay though...all the food runners were really cool...popping jokes., 1
We loved Shibuya's menu and extensive sake list. They obviously spend a lot of time fining the freshest best ingredients because my ahi was spectacular. We also shared the lobster salad which was equally as good. I highly recommend Shibuya for dinner if you're looking for excellent Japanese in Vegas., 1
Fresh fruit, 1
Another great visit to this store, 1
I just got my dog from the Arizona Humane Society and they suggested VCA. I was very happy with the care they gave Coco, 1
So I am here with a recommendation of am amazing chopped salad.  I didn't know my recommendation was to BURGER PLACE!  I do have to say it is more of finer dining place still.  I got the turkey grind to go with my salad.  I was wondering what the heck is a turkey grind??? It has to the best turkey burger patty I have ever had in my life!  I guess I just give it 4 out of 5 until I try sometime more customary., 1
Very chic ambiance. Service is very good and efficient. Food is very tasty, 1
stop 4 on our 7 state pho tour - and everything else you read is true.  my thoughts were like this... small, 1
I thought this place was really fun!  We came here on our last night in Vegas.  We were on the guestlist so we got in for free. I heard it's pricy if you have to pay. There were a lot of stairs, 1
What can I say.... I LOVE MATT'S BIG BREAKFAST! Everything I have had there has been fabulous.  The atmosphere is friendly. The food, 1
love the sushi here. service could have been a little more attentive. a little pricy, 1
Love Camelback Toyota for its sales. If you are interested in a Toyota, 1
I'm sure this place is always compared to the boiling crab.   OK, 1
Say it is not so!!! Cocomo's, 1
my husband took me here on my birthday and it was probably one of the best meals i've ever eaten.  getting the wagyu skirt steak was the best decision i made.  a pricey steak, 1
Always a great place to come for good food and some ambiance. Pizza is good, 1
Great food!! Love this place! I wish the dinning area was bigger but the service is always good. I've tried almost everything on the menu and can't say one bad thing about the food., 1
ok so dad and I went here 1 yr ago and got here after leaving 5 am est arriving 2pm pst but 5 pm est in our body  what we got isn't on the menu anymore? just wanna log for the records but we got some time of sampler, 1
This Dutch Bros had some of the best customer service I've ever seen from a young guy working on a holiday (Memorial Day). I ordered an Americano which was excellent and just the right proportions. My wife had a soy chai latte which was just a little too sweet, 1
This had long been a favorite of ours. The service is spot on and the food is fantastic. Never had a meal that I didn't like at the deli den. The Ruben and the Rachel are my favorites and if you like delis style sandwiches, 1
We just saw this show on 6/1 and it was great! My boyfriend and I were apart of the show towards the end which made it even greater of a show (I thought it was odd we were the only people in our row!!).  My boyfriend got taken up on stage and put in a box and one of the main guys came and sat next to me! Even before the show starts they have a guy interact with the audience, 1
Very beautiful looking inside. All the light and  yellow colors give you a warm full feeling so you enjoy your breakfast or lunch to the maximum. The orange juice is delicious 100% pure. French toast and crab Benedict are just incredibly amazing., 1
Pretty good food, 1
Really great white mochas and friendly staff!, 1
Hey now, 1
The food is excellent of the items we tried.  The prices were higher than we anticipated or we may rate it 5 stars.   The staff was prompt and friendly.    They had live music by an entertaining Irish gentleman and nice but a bit loud for our 3 month old but that is to be expected at a sports bar & grill...  We will come back to try other menu items and see what kind of happy hour they have, 1
Great food and good service. I have been to both locations, 1
Some stuff is cheaper. Other stuff is more expensive. I do like the deals at the deli. They have really good turkey and roast beef. They also give a 10% discount on cardinals home game day if you are wearing a jersey. Love that they support the local team. Go cardinals!, 1
This is THE best bike repair shop. I had my Trek road bike with Shimano Dura Ace components at another bike shop for a week and they couldn't fix a broken shifter or rear derailleur. They told me I needed to order new parts. I took it to Global and they fixed it in 1 day with no new parts needed. My bike has never ridden as smooth as now. I heard the shop owner/manager was part of the US Olympic cycling team and knows his stuff. If you are anywhere in the East Valley it is worth it to take your road bike here for maintenance., 1
Love them! We did some serious shopping around for my engagement ring and decided to end up having one custom made. The custom setting was much cheaper than just buying a setting from any of the other jewelers in town.. and they really aimed to please! They made 3 wax casts to make sure they really got it right, 1
One of the best places I found in Vegas for a traditional East coast style deli experience.  They have a large selection of fresh bagels made daily with most flavors and styles you can imagine available.  They have a very large dessert case with some very decadent entries.  They also have the good old fashioned big old piled with meat deli sandwich available.  The Pizza Bagel is always enormous and tasty, 1
One of my goals coming into Phoenix was to find a great, 1
started coming here a few months ago. good food and good prices., 1
Dr. Villa and Dr. Reyes-Hailey are absolutely wonderful and I wouldn't think of going to anyone else! They were there every step of the way for a complicated pregnancy I had and I'm happy to say that my daughter and I are healthy!  Dr. Villa is thorough and hilarious. Very knowledgeable and does what is best for YOU. Dr. Reyes-Hailey gets the same accolades from me and she will sit and talk with you about anything you need to discuss until you feel better.  Love this office and I love all of the administrative staff and nurses. Amazing amazing. Did I mention they play HGTV 24/7? :), 1
At the moment I am very convinced of the merit of this establishment.  While I did not yet get to explore it in its entirety, 1
This is a secret place that some people drive far to go to.  Great environment with colorful lights.  You can bring wine in.  Owner is a server and is great.., 1
I love Romados.  Have for many a year.  Until 2010 their "quarter chicken" trio (with fries and salad) was really 4 or 5 pieces of totally awesome chicken covered in spicy delicious portugese flavah.  So deliciously yummy.  Recently they underwent some renovations, 1
What a blast! Can't wait to do it next year and be the brightest person out there!, 1
Another surprise Yelp find for me! I had never heard of this place or even see it, 1
This Starbucks drive thru has spoiled me on others.  The wait is always less and the team is always friendlier.  The drinks are pretty awesome too., 1
I LOVED this place! I walked in and thought to myself, 1
L'Oeufrier is a breakfast chain established back in 1995 that is currently quickly expanding in and around Montreal region that I feel that within the next few years will be at the tip of everyone's tongue as the place to go to get a great breakfast much to the likes of Allo Mon Coco is today in Laval.  When I walked in with my wife and infant I expected something good but our experience here surpassed it by far and it was nothing short of excellence across the board and I can't wait to go into the details as to why I enjoyed my experience here so much.  L'Oeufrier offers a huge variety of breakfast, 1
Just moved to the apartments right next to park west, 1
We've eaten here a bunch of times now and the food is always good.  The rolls are decently sized and creative. Good value for money. Its the only place we frequent that actually remembers what I usually drink.   Granted we're always there on weeknights when its hardly ever really busy but we never had to wait long for our rolls and the service usually is excelllent so I dont know if there has been a change of staff or its just crazy busy during the weekends and that affects service but I dont recognize the issues others have mentioned.  One downside though is that you explicitly have to ask for the happy hour menu. It would be nice if they would just give it to you during happy hour., 1
Lunch today (Sunday, 1
I love this Hotel! I always look for other hotels to stay in because I consider myself adventurous but bang for buck this hotel win's my reservation every time. The Beds are heavenly, 1
Always a wonderful meal.  Perfect bistro atmosphere, 1
The food here is delicious!  I had the veggie enchiladas, 1
Madame curry! I love innovative cocktails and chandelier doesn't disappoint. Thanks again to the cosmopolitan for a fab start to a Vegas wkend!, 1
I went to Posh tonight for restaurant week with a friend and I must say....it was pretty awesome! Now, 1
I frequent this theater because (1) it's really close to home and (2) it is always well staffed and clean.  There is never a problem with parking, 1
Amy is such a great hair stylist. Love the way she does color and extensions are flawless if you are ready to go long give her a call. I have enjoyed Amy's hair care for 7  or 8 years. She is Amazing!!!, 1
Thanks yelpers for reviewing this place. We stopped here on our way from SF to Miami as we had to try native Arizonan food.  What a place. The description of the other yelpers is true, 1
Had a great time!, 1
Attended a business lunch here today and as always, 1
POSITIVES:  Great Service  - Our server, 1
Stopped in with 2 girlfriends for a ladies night out before going to dinner. They were beyond accommodating! The staff here is very friendly and funny... most importantly they all know what they are doing and the results are AMAZING!   They currently have a promotion going on where if you spend $50 you get a free mani on your next visit... AWESOME! The pricing was al reasonable, 1
I was in Vegas this past weekend for a joint bachelorette party and I arranged bottle service at JET for Saturday night through Dave, 1
I bought a groupon for this place so we decided to try it.   First impression it is a little shop but seemed clean.   Went to the counter where a you man was sitting on a stool and placed our order of garlic knots and lg pizza w basil, 1
We came here for a local getaway for Mother's Day weekend. From the moment we pulled up, 1
Excellent food and atmosphere. It's clear they care a lot about the food they're servinfg - the waiter took the time to explain each dish as he presented it to each guest. It felt like a family restaurant as well so it felt like they cared more than the average restaurant about the customer experience and were so proud of every dish. I would highly recommend trying La Porte. We went during one of the busiest weekends of the year in Montreal - the Grand Prix. A group of 8 of us went, 1
Came back again for the prime rib and I think it was even better then before.  Hand-down, 1
Bandera looks just like Houston's. I don't know why they have two almost identical restaurants types, 1
Today I went to Super Cuts and had my hair cut by Sandy, 1
This past weekend I attended a beautiful wedding in Arizona. The wedding was outdoors and Valley Ho was a great place to have it! When you enter the hotel the colors and d\u00e9cor definitely make you feel like you're an a upscale establishment. The wedding venue was next to a pool, 1
I really enjoyed this indoor play gym. Today was my first visit, 1
One of my favorite things about living in South End is being able to walk or ride to Good Bottle. It's easy to get there just off the rail trail/light rail. The owner, 1
This was my first time eating at this restaurant. I absolutely loved it! We came here when it first opened for lunch. We instantly knew this place was popular because it became packed very quickly. I loved the all you can eat menu. I pretty much ate until I was about to explode. I ordered mostly raw stuff and must say it was really good. My favs were the handrolls. Our orders came out pretty fast and the waitress was very attentive. This place will be a routine pit-stop the next time I'm in town., 1
Comfortable, 1
Had some solid Pepper steak. Food seems decent overall and portions are priced well., 1
The best ramen I've tried in Vegas so far. Their tonkatsu is yummy, 1
Love the fast service when too lazy to cook. The food is great., 1
Service here was outstanding.  I dropped my iPad and needed to replace the glass.  He estimated 60 minutes and called me 45 minutes later when it was complete...good as new., 1
Great service: When my wife and I went, 1
the hotel and the rooms are beautiful! i just love the feeling of staing at a hotel, 1
How could one not want to sit and enjoy the company of your friends and family while a super talented and personable hibachi chef cooks you guys fresh made to order good merely a couple feet from your face, 1
Food Portions are generous.  They feed you like an Italian family that never wants you to leave their house. Be ready to eat when you come here...with a cool 50s styling and really friendly atmosphere it lives up to the billing of a neighborhood joint.  Having come here more than a handful of times we have ordered pizza after pizza which is a solid choice.  This time we wanted to try to the pasta.  We ordered the Pesto Penne Bake and it is put in a bread bowl...delicious on so many levels we still couldn't finish it.  The pesto, 1
The food is really good. I have never eaten Middle Eastern food before and after this meal I am a fan. The prices are great. Had a party of 4 and ordered the meat platter. It was a ton of food for $20.00. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because their service is really bad. They did not even think to ask to refill our drinks. Once you ask for a refill they do refill your drink. They are not rude or anything, 1
My husband and I came for breakfast, 1
Our new favorite ice cream spot! With kronuts!!  Super friendly service, 1
Madame Tussauds is place that is just a place that makes people smile.  It is fun with wax :)   We just went the the this past August I had the best time taking pix with the figures and even going through their haunted house (why a haunted house - no idea, 1
wow I wish this mall was in CA.  they have so many of my favorite stores plus the great department stores: Nordstroms, 1
Best breakfast burritos around.  Huge & $4.  Can't beat that.  I get the bacon & add avocado.   The California chicken is amazing too.  My kids love the quesadillas. They use real authentic tortillas (probably have lard in them) but they are soon yuum. I always take tons of their hot sauces home & use them all week.   The red sauce is the best!  It's a taco shop but cheap & good. Not greasy like filibertos & Armando's, 1
Got me in quickly when my puppy was not feeling well... I was afraid I would have to take him to the emergency Vet (which is extremely expensive), 1
Although I didn't care for the decor, 1
This club is attached to 8 1/2 which makes the $20 cover worth paying.  Gogo dancers are yummy.  bartenders are so attentive and friendly.  They do play mainly house music.  Hip Hop music and dance is played on the 8 1/2 side.  Drinks are reasonable $8 wells, 1
This place is very very very small, 1
I eat here every time in in town... The service is hit and miss, 1
My favorite sandwiches in Vegas. New york style. Tons of meat in them. My favorite is the pastrami panini. Also comes with a pickle on the side, 1
Love the freshly grilled and seasoned meats.  Adobada and asada are excellent - especially with the creamy green sauce!! Tiny tacos pack a punch of flavor., 1
I had to do it and bought myself another toy at Guns and Ammo Garage, 1
This place is pretty new, 1
When I'm loyal to an airline, 1
I enjoyed myself at Tryst but I didn't really care for the music which kinda puts a damper on someones experience at a club. Don't get me wrong the venue was nice; both inside and outside but looks only count for so much.   One of the main reasons I am giving Tryst 4-stars is because they know how to treat the ladies. I went here for my sister's bachelorette party and we were treated quite well by the staff. We had no problems getting in which isn't really that surprising because we were a group of 10 ladies. Secondly, 1
I love Saddle Ranch for the fun atmosphere. I really like the food and the people who work here are so much fun! I I came here for brunch on the 4th of July and the waiter was pretty honest about being hungover and made us laugh the whole time we were there. He gave me the biggest mimosa I have ever had and gave me and my friends a free shot. The brunch specials are awesome their mimosas and bloody mary's are only $1.99 and you can choose different variations of the classic drinks. I always leave Saddle Ranch with a smile on my face., 1
This place is super awesome! The lady was very sweet and helpful with any questions I had. Lots of fun flavors and all the ones i tryed had a punch of flavor, 1
A relaxing place to have wine, 1
Yelp needs a 10 star option for this place. I LOVE MIKKI!! Every time we come she is wonderful! The food is amazing.  The Kai Pik Pao, 1
Forgot to write them up after our visit in October.  I have eaten at several RC's and this one takes the cake for service and quality of food.  Hit most of them in every major city and wasn't planning on eating dinner here.  It was dumb luck as my wife didn't want to walk anymore and wanted food immediately.  Lucky for me we were in front of Harrah's.  Walked right in and had the best experience at a RC yet.  Way to go folks in Vegas.    Locations I have eaten at are:  Annapolis, 1
Even though Roy's is a nationwide chain, 1
We had been there twice. The lunch price is very good. The green curry is great.  Tofu salad is also very good. We like the place. The only thing is it is a little far from us., 1
This place is hands down the best buffet in all of Las Vegas, 1
Finding someone who can make better mole than I can deserves 4 stars.  My absolute favorite is the chicken mole burrito.  The chickens mole burrito is just that- loaded with lots of shredded chicken, 1
I had Pete the representative from Classy Closets come out to my house and do a drawing and give me a quote. He was very professional and gave us a couple of new ideas that we didn't even think of. We had new garage cabinets, 1
Best chicken wings, 1
I have never been to a restaurant were you wear a bib and eat with your hand. This was definetly a place were wearing your finest cloths might not be a good idea. I ordered the hot n juicy special and it was really good. They hand you a plastic bag with your food and you chow down. I got the shrimp and I like the fact that you can order how many pounds you wanted. I would definetly recommend this to anyone that loves sea food and doesn't mind eating with their hand and getting messy., 1
I went for the chipotle bacon egg breakfast burrito and didn't look back! It was damn tasty and their selection of salsas are good. I was visiting for a wedding so I'll probably never be back in Fountain Hills, 1
Pork chile verde pot pie and baked sweet potato (served with chile lime butter)...5 Stars  The Chino salad (cabbage, 1
Always get the southwestern chicken salad. Fresh salad mix with slightly crispy chicken strips makes for great flavor & the perfect salad! The service isn't anything to mention but not bad. Overall happy with this place and will return, 1
I recently had a few scratches put on my new Camaro.  I have only had the car a couple weeks and some unsightly marks on the front from some friends messing around just didn't appeal to me.  I looked around on Yelp for a decent body shop that wouldn't break my pocket!  THANK GOD I went to see these guys!  Jeremy is AMAZING took such good care of me that I will ONLY go see these guys from now on! Trust all these reviews, 1
Vegan donuts, 1
Isabela is a small, 1
Buffalo Wild Wings beats the heck out of "Other wing restaurants" any day of the week. Their wings are insanely good. They have about a dozen different sauces ranging from mild to "Blazin".   I love their craft beer selection. That's actually my downfall there, 1
My boyfriend and I went to Montreal for Valentines weekend. Fonduementale definitely stood out as one of our favorite memories of the trip.  We did not have a reservation, 1
One of the best gems of Las Vegas. Good date spot or a big group in the private dinning room. Wine selections is great. You have to try the hot rock appetizer., 1
This place is GREAT!  I had a suit and a dress that I needed dry cleaned, 1
Best pad thai i've had in Canada. Note that medium spiciness can kill many people. If you are not good at it, 1
Crazy good food and quite reasonable pricing!  I had the shogun burger with the foie gras waygu and unagi. Awesome. Wife had the Mr Ho's...also very tasty. And the Ox tail fries...to die for.  My only negatives. The hostess didn't seem like she wanted to be there, 1
The grass is green, 1
We were a group of eight. Celebrating an adult birthday with cosmic bowling. Great idea! The shoes weren't icky. Bring your own socks!  The staff was helpful and we all had a good time. The one complaint, 1
I don't eat fish, 1
Finally! A place where they actually listen to what you want. I've been getting my eyebrows threaded since summer of last year and I've never been happy with the results. I used to go to Eyebrows R Us at different locations and because of this I always get a different aesthetician. This is why I end up with different looking eyebrows every time. After some research here on Yelp, 1
After 6 years in Pittsburgh and hitting most of the 'hot spots, 1
Great Customer service. The guys are really down to earth, 1
The food is fantastic! We enjoyed Shepard's Pie, 1
I just ate here for my second time and I love the menu! It is your basic city type menu but between the atmosphere of the restaurant and the many different choices on the menu that i would be happy with, 1
Yay for Hana!  I guess I'm a little late to find this place but thanks to my friend Brian who loves to try out new places as much as I do (next up, 1
Like Cara C. I really want this restaurant to do well, 1
I am not a fan of baseball.  I think it is a terrible game, 1
I've always been curious about Wally's; I've driven by it countless times, 1
Good food. Had the Kobe rib cap, 1
I was stalking the Pizza People Food Truck all week to get a couple passes to Street Eats on Saturday and finally found the truck on my side of town. Drove over to 48th St & University around 1145am and there was already a line formed. Perused the menu board and honed in on the Popeye - spinach, 1
My quick summary-  Normal bar food taken to a whole 'nother level.  I rarely travel to this neighborhood in Scottsdale, 1
I love the fact this place is open 24 /7. Just went through the drive thru this evening ended up getting 18 donuts, 1
I use FedEx quite a bit for work.  This location has always been my go to location as it is close to the house.  Over the past few weeks I have ventured to another location and I now appreciate this location much more.   The staff is always friendly and helpful.  They have supplies that I need for shipping express or ground.    Express pick up is at 4:30pm.  They are open to 11pm!, 1
edinburgh is a wonderful city which is absolutely chock full of excellent bars and restaurants, 1
Once you experience the Loew's Club seating, 1
I may have a slight addiction to Marty's Market... But please, 1
2 words: BUTTERY WISCONSIN. That should already say it all. The burger was sooooo moist and, 1
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. The husband and I have been coming here for years now and it is still one of our favorite burger places. The Delux Burger is just fantastic with caramelized onions, 1
Wow!  This place is pretty awesome.  Food is A++ I must say.  I'm not a big fan of Americana food, 1
Big airport with long taxis into your gate if you're unlucky (which I was).  Surly TSA folks who don't like the human phlegm cavorting through their airport.  That's the bad.  The good?  People watching equals a 10+ for sure!  Warmer than Cincinnati in the winter (that was easy).  Fun to fly in at night as you can see Vegas' lights screaming at you in the middle of all that blackness from at least 100 miles out, 1
What an absolute surprise. Was not expecting some of the best Thai I have ever had in a strip mall in Wisconsin. A great find and a destination to return to., 1
It's not like you can go just anywhere for over the counter pharmaceuticals, 1
This restaurant is near my office and me and the boy stopped in on our way back to Tempe from Carefree for breakfast this morning. There were quite a few people waiting before us, 1
I SO want to give this place 5 stars.  Friendly, 1
manmade waves at the pool.  nuff said.  weeeee, 1
Fair prices, 1
It's very difficult to find a quality bakery here in the Las Vegas area.  This bakery is filled with sweet and savory.  There was a variety of cakes and petite desserts.  So far, 1
The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. They were able to confidently help us find the right fuses. Ace even had the Webster duster/spider killer that I hadn't been able to find elsewhere! I was in and out fast., 1
Let me start by saying my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by just about everything at The Barrymore and not because we had no expectations.  Having lived in Las Vegas for nearly ten years, 1
I enjoy Italian food a lot, 1
Visiting Wisconsin this past weekend, 1
The food here is great! It is difficult to find restaurants that cater to my food allergies and this one definitely does. I love that they have gluten free, 1
Nice clean place .  I like this location here.  Convenient too.  Friendly staff., 1
These guys know their products. Very friendly, 1
I was devastated when the location on Raintree "located" to Camelback. Even though it seems sooo far to drive to this one it's worth my drive at least once a week for lunch. Especially on Wednesdays when it's $2.00 off.   They have everything you could ever want between the salad bars, 1
Always great food!! I luv that they have happy hour 7 days a week. This is one of my favorites., 1
The Encore comes in as Wynn's younger, 1
Updated:  12/17/12  The Good:  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The front desk was very friendly (Lindsay at the front desk has been particularly friendly and helpful) at check-in and the restaurant staff were also very nice.  The room was clean and well kept with a ~24" flat TV and decent furniture.  The breakfast  has been improved since the last time.  The potatoes were much better than before and the eggs were done on a per order basis when it wasn't busy.  The bacon and was quite a bit better.  The Not So Good:  Dinner was decent but still left a bit to be desired as far as seasoning and interesting flavors to their dishes.  They would do well to get a little more variety of beers on tap as well.  Yes it is a hotel by the airport but I've stayed at several hotels this lose to airports and they generally have better windows to isolate some of the noise.  Overall, 1
I've dined here 3 times & the food is wonderful! I love the roasted pork on the secret or paleo menu it's amazing. The pasta is extremely good as well my husband ordered the classic and loved it. I definitely recommend giving it a try!, 1
Enjoyed lunch here!  Great menu, 1
Today was the first time I've been up this early for breakfast!  The food was good and the drive-thru service was fast and friendly . . . too bad they won't be serving breakfast after Oct. 20, 1
Delicious ice cream, 1
Gorgeous suites that's standard. Everything feels like luxury, 1
Monta Chaya is like the younger, 1
Absolutely amazing food and service here. Waiters are very attentive, 1
Newest casino in Vegas - six reasons to hit up the east side's version of Red Rock:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zvnm7o2eMaYAEHS8YRn_EQ?select=W_GX-Y-dbmS5WWMcvP3RYg  1. Ok well it's no Red Rock.  The Boulder Hwy casinos are like a newer version of downtown, 1
Delicious and everyone there is so friendly!, 1
Having been to the Philippines working on U.S. Military projects, 1
Picked up two large pizzas last weekend.  Was shocked on how big these pizzas are.  Four hungry adults couldn't eat it all.  Also amazed by how many TVs are in the restaurant.  Will be dinning in soon to watch some football and eat some great pizza., 1
Just to make a point, 1
All the dishes are so well presented. I am a fan of Maiko Sushi the fish is fresh, 1
I'm an avid lover for Boiling Crab, 1
Simply amazed! I took my car in for a piece of metal stuck in one of my tires near the sidewall.   The service tech checked the tire and was able to remove the metal without much resistance and asked that I pull the car into the garage to do a quick air check to ensure that it hadn't punctured the tire wall.  Luckily, 1
Someone decided to throw a very large rock through our window today at Abby Bella. Smashed the window in broad daylight opened the cash register, 1
Awesome restaurant.  I have been going to Sacks for over 15 years and am never dissapointed.  The staff is friendly, 1
This was some of the best sushi we've ever had! Its was so fresh & they had really unique rolls. The service was outstanding! We got a lot of personal attention and we will definitely go back! Great ambiance, 1
George and his staff are tops in our book.  We try to eat here once a month.  It's a great atmosphere where you feel like you are eating at home with friends. Never had a bad meal here.  Rib Eye, 1
The owners of 5 Church have done it again with Nan and Byron's. We started lunch with the Pablano Cheese dip and the Poppers. Both were excellent! I ordered the meatloaf sandwich due to the stellar reviews on Yelp and I was glad that I did.  The pan seared meatloaf was full of flavor - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The Mojito fries were good but not great.  I think I had built them up in my head to taste a certain way and they just didn't live up to the mint/lime flavor I was expecting.    The ambiance inside the restaurant is pretty trendy.  Certainly a cool place to enjoy a nice meal and a few drinks with friends., 1
The great thing about this place is its 24 hours and you can go in there buy whatever it is you needed that you forgot on your trip. Me and my wife came in here after wandering the casinos around 2 am because we forgot our tooth brushes at home, 1
This is the only spot my man will get his hair cut!! The barbers are thorough, 1
Zoo lights is just so cool. They really do a great job. Every year gets better. I did notice it seemed like a few things were missing from years past but they also had a large light display out on the lake with a big globe of lights right in the middle. Every 15 minutes there was a synchronized light show. So this newer edition was pretty cool. Also I did not know about the snow slide. This was really fun. For $3 a person per ride or you could buy multiple rides if you wanted you climb to the top of a hill basically and the put you in a cloth covered inter-tube and while keeping your feet up they push you off the edge and down about a 200 foot slide. Wow was that a lot of fun. I could have ridden that 10 more times. I will when we go next year. Don't forget the talking giraffe. All the little kids were talking with the giraffe and when she said the random fact that she weights over 2000 lbs one the little kids pipes in with Your fat. Oh the things kids say. This has to be one of the few zoos in the country that does this and I thing it is great. My girlfriend is a zoo member so she gets free passes every year so we will be back. I am heading to the snow slide first thing., 1
Went for dinner last night..The food was awesome, 1
I LOVED this Barney's. I bought an amazing pair of Helmut Lang leggings on sale for $100. The sale in their Co-Op section was extensive. The employees were extremely friendly and helpful... Far more than what I'm used to. I wish I could transplant this exact store to LA!, 1
This place has been a local spot for quite some time, 1
I work in this area and have visited most of the local restaurants in the past few years. Came in at 2pm for a late lunch on a Friday and ordered the Lucia (sausage and mushrooms). Once the pizza is prepared, 1
I love mole. I mean, 1
This place is unreal!  I had lunch there yesterday- on the recommendation of these reviews.  It was better than I'd hoped, 1
Ok my husband an I have been members for like 15 years and have always had top notch service but my most recent solo experience was above and beyond.  They :A) insinuated: Are you comfortable being a single female out there?  (and if not we are wiling to help)/keep you safe) but B) Which is HILARIOUS I put a snarky alcoholic snide remark on their facebook about how lame the icemaker was and they frikkin replaced the icemaker! Lord a mercy!, 1
really cool place, 1
awesome pub that has really nice and watchful bouncers, 1
Great food Great Song, 1
A while back I was driving along Eastern, 1
The hill is great!!! Best food in town!! French dip is amazing!!! Very clean place. Definatly recommend this place. The owner CERTAINLY built one heck of a business!!!, 1
Pros:  It's the most beautiful club I have ever been to, 1
Stopped by for a bite with the wife tonight. Oh man, 1
So Cherish H and I have never been able to see eye to eye on the Wicked Spoon Buffet but I still love her dearly.  // LOCATION // Inside the Cosmopolitan on the second floor through a seemingly endless maze of empty casino aside for some awesome modern art. Perhaps this is to prepare your stomach for the food marathon it is about to embark on.   // WAIT // Ridiculous. You wait in a massive line to pay and another behemoth of a line to be seated.   // FOOD // I've eaten both brunch and dinner at the Wicked Spoon. I love the portion control here. It is a win-win situation for both the diner and the restaurant because food is not wasted and you still have enough room in your stomach to try all the other goodies. Here are my personal fave finds:       + Mushroom polenta: Like crack. The polenta is creamy and delish with a drizzle of truffle oil. The mushrooms are perfectly cooked. I still dream about this dish!       + Salted Caramel pancakes: Fluffy and sweet enough they don't require any syrup      + Cheddar Hash browns with caramelized onions: Great combo.       + Mashed potatoes: Sounds simple, 1
I went here on a date with my boyfriend while visiting La Vegas last weekend. I was really extremely happy with the great service. Everyone was very polite and cheerful, 1
I LIKE TALKING MY HUSBAND OUT OF BUYING THINGS HE DOESN'T NEED  Sweetheart, 1
wow...ive eaten a lot of thai food in my day, 1
We went here as a large group (entire softball team and families). The restaurant was super accommodating and they basically gave us an entire section to ourselves and we had multiple servers at our disposal.  Being from CA the prices were lower than I was used to which was a nice surprise. However, 1
Food was amazing. Coming from Charleston, 1
Best wings I've ever had. Perfectly crispy, 1
What a deal on Groupon ... $6 (used to be $5, 1
I went to the restaurant after reading comments on yelp and I wasn't disappointed. Great service and great burgers at a reasonable price. The waitress did an awesome job guiding us through the menu and the beverage selection. The burgers were cooked as ordered and the selection itself was nice.  Definitely a place to stop if you're looking for good honest food at a reasonable price., 1
We usually try to eat here whenever we visit from SoCal. I always get the spicy noodles (vegetarian), 1
Great experience! Upgraded for free to the grand (24th floor), 1
If you are looking for a highly academic school with a small-town community feel in the middle of Scottsdale look no further.   After much review of the local schools in our area we decided to open enroll my daughter at Sequoya for K. I have been extremely happy with this choice. Sequoya is a top rated school with a strong community. The pillar of this school is its leadership forged by Dr. Braney. She is out on campus speaking with her students and parents every day. The Parent Teacher Association also plays a large role in the success of this school and welcomes all parents. There are diverse leadership experiences for ALL students in 4-5th grade to prepare them for middle school.  The on-site pre-school (Children's Choice) is remarkable! We were paying a considerable amount more for childcare before. This is not childcare; it is seasoned, 1
Took the girls here for Mother's Day and sat on the patio, 1
Cool concept. The fries and the sauces are delicious--my friends and I got a bunch of different ones... the garlic/rosemary and the madcity sauce were my favs. But be forewarned... this is literally just fries and sauces to dip them in. Nothing fancy., 1
A good natured host, 1
The place was packed around lunch time, 1
Grabbed a quick lunch here with my son.  Sell pizza by the slice so there was no real wait time.  They have slice combos which are pretty cheap.    We also ordered a dozen wings.  This was plenty for both of us.  The wings were good and big., 1
Great place to stop in and grab lunch! Food is always fresh and the selection..well they've got a lot to choose from. :-), 1
We just got married here on Saturday and everything was absolutely perfect. The service that my guests received was top notch!    The hotel is far from the strip but, 1
This is in my top 5 dining experiences in Las Vegas. My friend and I went here for just drinks and appetizers, 1
I went on a Friday, 1
I'm going all out on my 1st visit with 5 stars.   I stopped by midday, 1
We enjoyed the ambiance and food at Cafe Monarch - nearly a perfect evening! It's tucked away on 1st Avenue in Scottsdale, 1
Our first night in Vegas we happened upon this place because we had just lost all the money we were willing to part with at the Treasure Island black jack tables. (This is false advertising in my mind, 1
I'm glad Groupon exists. Thanks to Groupon my girlfriend and I were able and motivated to try this place out. Extremely elegant and modern decor. The upstairs and downstairs cater to different clientele. I doubt you'd go wrong dining on either level. If you are able to, 1
I could not recommend a hotel more.  If I lived in a city this is the apartment I would want.  Compact, 1
This Starbucks was busy when I went. There was a convention for the NFR (national finals rodeo) that weekend. It had all kinds of different customers, 1
BEST TACO EVER!   Adobada Pork!  Ask for extra salsa.  Ask for the plate of veggies.  EVEN BETTER WHEN DRUNK!  Right next to the Wynn. They had live music at around 2am...!   So SooooooOOOOooo GOOOOD!  -Give it a try!, 1
Ate here twice during my stay in Vegas because the price was good and there was a good amount of food given. I haven't been to the cheesecake factory but this place is pretty good.   Ahi tuna salad - was just okay. It was wrapped in seaweed, 1
I was really sad to see CJ's go, 1
Nikki did my nails today and I love them, 1
I visited this location a few times during my stay in Las Vegas.  This location is far better than my home gym, 1
My wife and I have been here twice and have loved it each time!  This is not only a nice place to go if you're craving something vegetarian.  They have great sandwiches and bowls that are enjoyable, 1
King's Kitchen fills many voids in the Charlotte area. First it's a meat & three, 1
Yelpers led us to this one too.    Walked in after having pho from down the street.  Another place open late.  Yay!   Since it was our first time there, 1
My boyfriend and I went on the tour from the Las Vegas strip to the Grand Canyon. He has been on a helicopter tour before, 1
This has been my favorite breakfast place for maybe 2 years? I live the French toast a lot of my friends get the huervos rancheros.   For lunch my favorite is the chicken-Roma sand which. If you ask what the most popular lunch is they're likely to say this. Everything here is great though- and healthy!  The smoothies are bomb too!, 1
This place is near work and decent as far as lunch and being able to find a place to sit.  They are average as far as cost but food consistently meets expectations with generous portions.  Nice to browse some of the old photos on the walls., 1
I went for the first time today. I ordered the Pad Thai lunch combo with pork. It was very tasty! The service was good and so were the spring rolls and soup they served as an appetizer. The restaurant was clean and had pleasant music playing in the background.  I will certainly be back. I was very satisfied with my experience., 1
Great food if you have an enormous appetite!, 1
When I'm in Montreal, 1
Had Phat Franks for the first time just a few hours ago. Very impressed with the food and Frank.   He and his helper (didn't catch her name) are very cordial and really make an effort to offer exceptional service.   Ordered one carnitas and two chicken tacos. They were phenomenal! I love tacos and try to sample as many as possible. Frank does a great job. The meat is flavorful, 1
I was meeting very good friends from Italy so decided to splurge on Sky Suites - got a 2 BR for my family and a 1 BR for him and his wife and kid.  Great rooms, 1
One of the premier hotels around the valley.   For me, 1
My printer was broken and found this nearby library: just 2-3 minutes driving. It opens 7 days a week and is in brand new and quiet condition. The library staffs were all helpful and I printed out what I needed in just a minute. I wish I have more time exploring their book selections., 1
Mmmmmm......Penguin.  A former drive-in that's trying really hard to be funky....I definitely give them an A for effort.  One of the first places I came to eat when I moved to Charlotte because, 1
Juliette & Chocolat is a cafe, 1

While Jacks Warehouse might not cater to everyones needs, 1
I cannot say enough positive about how I was treated at Kelly's.  In the past, 1
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Came here when Kaskade was dj-ing during Halloween weekend and he tore the place up! I loved the dancers up top shaking their thang and when you go outside away from the main room there was hip hop playing, 1
Finally tried out the Tryst Cafe after a hike Sunday morning and I must say, 1
Great service. Very smart and friendly staff. The manager and his team are the real deal., 1
After some initial confusion about where the "Box Office" was to get my will call tickets (its a small table with a computer near the Fitzgeralds' Showroom) and some almost rudely probing questions the evening got started.  The food was decent, 1
Been to this location many times and never a bad meal..always great service and awesome burger, 1

What a beautiful restaurant. The colorful tile, 1
Fantastic food! My husband and I both ordered burgers (Guy's signature burger and the Mac n cheese burger) and they were both delicious. The fries were just amazing. Our drinks were good (jack n coke for the husband and some blackberry margarita for me), 1
We were heading out to the container park and decided to hit MTO Caf\u00e9 for a late brunch beforehand. MTO is located on Main St. just across the street from the new City Hall. And even though I can only think of the Food Network when I see their logo, 1
klassisches Konzept    Essen ok und sehr g\u00fcnstig Getr\u00e4nke eher leicht teuer    Viel Platz, 1
As you read the other reviews on his place, 1
It's quite possibly the most detailed coffee experience in Las Vegas. Actually that's exactly what it is.  The Sambalatte people are coffee geeks, 1
Around the corner from my house!!! They recently remodeled (not sure why) but looks great! Staff is friendly and drinks are made correctly. My only criticism is that this place doesn't have a drive thru!! I love stopping here a few times a week and will keep returning!, 1
Came here for an early dinner when it was nearly empty but quickly filled up shortly after we arrived. The server was very friendly and genuine, 1
The food is soooo yummy! I recomend the zany zeti. They give the kids dough to play with. What a great idea!, 1
First time trying smash burger and I've definitely found my new favorite burger place! I had the the truffle mushroom Swiss burger. The sauce to die for, 1
Our fave place. Service superb. Food Delicious! Reasonable price. DELICIOUSNESS!!, 1
Pei Wei is fast, 1
We tried Classic Italian Pizza for dinner last night.  We shared an appetizer of Aglio Olio and got two pies.  The appetizer was really good-the dipping oil is pumpkin seed oil based and has fresh minced garlic and a little fresh jalapeno for a bit of zing.    We could all use a bit of zing infused in our days, 1
FIRST.  I was lucky enough to be at the Hanging bat last night for an opening event. I'd been avoiding peeking in in order to survey it in it's full glory once it opened and I was not disappointed. First of all it smelt REALLY GOOD. Like wood chips, 1
I had a nice lunch here today with Norm R.  This is the eighth Souper Salad I have tried around the Valley, 1
I have used Pampered Pets multiple times for my little Pomeranian.  Paul is very nice and helpful with my shy somewhat protective Yogi Bear.  He took the time to let Yogi get to know him before taking him to the trailer which is good. Always a good job on the trimming and the shampoo smells so good. He also gave us tips on how to keep his cut looking fresh. Having the groomer come to the house is a huge convenience, 1
Fig and marscapone bruschetta is to die for. I crave it all the time! Vintage 95 in Chandler has attempted to copy Postino's recipe for success, 1
The truffle fries are way too good.  I go with a girlfriend every time we go to Vegas.  We get a coupon from restaurant.com  and cab it over.  It is nice to be in the one spot without slot machines.  The ambiance is quiet and comfortable.  Our service has been outstanding.  The filet mignon was perfect and my friend's lobster practically disappeared.  She said her scallops on a previous visit were the best she has ever eaten. The wine and drinks were done well.  We will return, 1
The apps and entrees is where it's at here at The King's Kitchen.  We got the sweet potato fritters and pimento cheese.  Both were nice and fresh and filled with flavor.  I also got a cup of the gumbo which was pretty stellar.  I ordered the Southern Risotto and the Hubby got the pork chop.  Both were the perfect combo of savory with a hint of salt.   My cousin got the shrimp and grits.  She's a pretty particular eater, 1
I hold Yelp responsible for all my weight gain. What happens is that I read the yummy reviews posted by fellow yelpers and bookmark all these places in my head. When a craving hits me, 1
Avid yogi - I plan to get buried in my Lu Lu garb!  A little vain perhaps, 1
There was one drink I have always enjoyed was a Cosmo. I typically liked drinks that weren't too strong; only a bit of an alcohol taste but enough to know it was there, 1
Who would have thought a steakhouse in the Luxor would be a treat! To be honest, 1
I've had a lot of sushi from a lot of places, 1
I come here every time I'm in town, 1
best place in Pittsburgh.  The outside taco stand is the best, 1
Other than oxymoron of a British Burger with Swiss Cheese, 1
Dropped in for lunch on a Saturday.  Was relatively crowded, 1
Since this place is on so many "top ten" lists, 1
I have 4 properties in Las Vegas, 1
Yes indeed! This is what Vegas buffets are all about. It's been a while since I've been to Vegas and I visited the buffet at Rio back then. I was tired of people looking at me crazy when I told my archaic Vegas stories, 1
Service was outstanding! From the hostesses, 1
have sandwiches been around for 250 years?   sandwiches here are good considering the price. they are pretty fast, 1
I'm from Chicago. I visited Charlotte during spring break to scope out the area since I'm planning on relocating there in the summer. I had my Navy son with me since I decided to use that time to drive him back to base in Jacksonville, 1
The Mix Restaurant at Mandalay Bay is very delicious. We tried many items on the menu and topped it off with alcohol and dessert. However, 1
Situated right by the lobby/reception area inside Aria, 1
First time  buyers.  Menu  is limited but lots of condiments.  Tried their polish dog it was a little pricy. The dog was tasty and we added so  added extra hot sauce. We would try again, 1
I got the Texas sliders with sweet potato sides and they were really good! I assume my friends like their food too when almost all of them ate all of it. But service was not that great. We had to wait for 15 mins to get service, 1
Best Indian in Madison. This is my happy place. The dining room is always filled with other happy Madisonians mowing on Indian. Maharaja - do it. And be sure to order the masala tea., 1
Love this place.  So few dance clubs are still around that I don't feel like I'll be shot at.  Now that Devil's Martini is closed, 1
Excited to go to BurGR. Don't go out for burgers all that often, 1
Great sushi spot.. I'd say this is comparable with I love sushi due to Sushi WA has all you can eat.. The sushi is just as good.. They also have very nice staff. My waitress is very kind and Funny.. Have to check this spot out.. I'd recommend the xxx roll., 1
My 23 months old daughter and I love this place, 1
The. Real. Deal.   Finally, 1
We dined at Hugo's Cellar to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday.  We had a great meal...the absolute highlight of which was the salad service.  I believe the waiter's name was Victor (?) and he MADE the evening.  Asking each person what salad ingredients they wanted in a fun, 1
Service was excellent. We loved our food. Probably the best pancake I ever had. Eggs and potatos perfect. Coffee good diner style. Love this place and the people., 1
The pizza is excellent. I had a thin crust pie with amazing sausage, 1
I love this place. I usually go a couple times a month. I've been to another location of theirs in Chandler, 1
VALET!!! That is the only way to go at this place because as great as the miracle mile mall is I am not a fan of walking through it all the time.  The elevator took forever too.  Room was clean and big enough.  Cleaning people did an ok job.  forgot to do one of the beds.  But besides that who can beat that price pretty good!  The front staff was pretty sweet too. He ran out of double bed rooms but  when I told him we broke down on the strip and he was going to make me cry one popped out of thin air! LOVED IT!!, 1
I discovered the poker room on my a previous trip to Vegas. I used to always play at the MGM Grand or before that at the Bellagio, 1
I love Thai food and this place was definitely delicious! My friends and I went late night after seeing the Zarkana show at Aria. We all orderd something different so we could share! Sesame chicken pad thai basil beef fried rice another chicken dish that was in a clay pot pot stickers and their noodles. We enjoyed it all! And the staff was very nice and knowledgeable. Helped us pick out great dishes to try., 1
After having been on the road for hours, 1
Terrible Herbst is I think one if not the best "local" owned gas station chains here in Las Vegas. This one in particular has a Mc Donald's built in with it, 1
Between the dancing, 1
Excellent choice if your looking for a little island flavor close to home.   Mac salad-oh yeah baby!  Mixed plate was tasty and hit the spot.  I will be back.  Food:  Excellent flavor!  Quality:  beef a little tough in some spots but not too bad Price: comparable to other Hawaiian BBQ.  Service:  friendly Thanks brah!, 1
8/30/2012 5:15pm reservation, 1
This place is close to my house and I usually go on a Saturday morning. I've been going for almost a year, 1
I'm weak willed and went back.  The last few times they have redeemed themselves.  Great food and service (can't beat small plates in my book) and the music is pretty stellar. All around, 1
Had several martinis that contained extra-large olives stuffed with goat cheese. The hanging lights, 1
Wow.....there are some seriously less than glowing reviews here.    I'll go against the crowd on this one....  I thought the decor was incredible.  This is coming from someone who has Mexican blood flowing through his veins and who knows Mexican culture, 1
This was my first time hiking, 1
This is one of our favorite neighborhood spots.  At first, 1
love this place.. ya they do tinga!  go with a group and order a bunch of tacos.. I order my tinga tacos in a non crisp shell / instead a basic corn tortilla... good cocktails, 1
I'm so happy with the service at Central Bark.  I brought my Chihuahua puppy here after we get a free day in her obedience class.  She did so well, 1
Dom's has closed, 1
The best steak hands down!  Service is the best.  I ate here twice, 1
Good local Spanish bakery. We've been there a few times. The whole-wheat croissants are delicious., 1
The other positive reviews are right on. Very tasty, 1
We stopped in today for the Yelp Shops Local shopping crawl and the sweets are sooo yummy! They were so friendly with us and provided us a sample of their truffles. I had the chocolate cake truffle and promptly bought 2 more....to die for. I also picked up a mini blueberry pie for my husband ($8) that looked delicious, 1
Wonderful! After driving by Bink's for months and wishing I was seated at the patio, 1
We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a long weekend and I ended up at Border Grill a couple times.  The 4 stars are really for the weekend brunch - all you can eat tapas that were interesting and (mostly) tasty.  I went back for the margaritas later which were also tasty though not particularly cheap.  You'd think the upstairs patio would be a good place to watch the beach concerts but the waiter said it was too dark to see the stage. Alas., 1
Great place to stay right on the strip. Arrived on a Thursday night and check in was swift and even received free upgrade to strip view. Rooms are clean and nice. Elevators are fast and miracle mile shops and earls are right on casino floor. Will definitely stay here again. Only thing is I wish the rooms had some other type of music player besides alarm clock radio Lol, 1
Whoohoo!  The yelpers got it right!!!!!!!  Delish to everything! This rice should come live with me. The gyros are my heros. Oh and try some before you buy some pita bread and pita chips. I'm hiding the cinnamon pita chips from my sister as we speak. Lemonade is made with real wild honey and these are not small cups. I'm full trying to make it through this review before I nap on the table., 1
When it comes to Vegas restaurants, 1
I am the foodie of the family and my Dad is the one who introduced me to this restaurant.  It was a great addition to the Central & Camelback area that was overrun with chains.  It is a little bit new, 1
New and modern. Understated aesthetics. Balcony might be the best room feature. Interesting glass shower and tub view from the bedroom. Good size suite. No free internet.  The casino itself is like any other vegas strip casino. Nothing stands out to set it apart from the rest.  On weekends, 1
I really like this tanning salon. Service has been great for me so far. I've tanned regularly at a couple other salons in town that I loved, 1
This place is nice. Its not too expensive and they carry lots of variety.  I used the 15% off yelp offer and paid $8for 2 smoothies. I ordered the berry oat and hated the splenda taste. They promptly and happily made me a different one and I loved it. I only order that one now. Its the health nut-but I sub out the protein for yougart., 1
I went here this morning with a persistent cough, 1
I'd like to write something about the Vegas Nocturne show but it's something that needs to be experienced rather than read about. Fun, 1
Charming, 1
On the suggestion from another Yelper i went in here to have a screw put in my glasses. They Open at 930 during weekdays and 9 am on saturday. She quoted me a price before the work began. She was friendly and had the screw put in quickly and adjusted them for me too. And made sure they fit right before i left. This is a blessing in disguise and anytime i need glasses repaired or know someone who needs them repaired i will recommend this company. Its close to the 95 and Valley View and Close to the i15 freeway and the strip for future reference., 1
Just writing this review makes me feel centered and at peace.  I have been practicing yoga on and off for about 7 years at At One Yoga.  I have been at nearly every type of class offered: yin, 1
Oh Wings. How glad I am that I found you.  Discovered through a perusal of 'cheap eats in Edinburgh' on Yelp, 1
The grilled fish burger was a delight that I look forward to consuming over, 1
YUMM!!  Uptown, 1
Great low dollar comfort food.  For all the over priced restaurant's in these hotels, 1
I don't tend to look for Thai food in Phoenix, 1
This is my first time at this steak. We had house salad with balsamic dressing, 1
Heard so many good things I just had to check it out. So on a super hungry day I went down to Dad's, 1
This is truly a hidden gem. I have driven by here a million times....past the run down strip mall...even knowing of the great reviews I always tell myself...LATER...BUT finally I stopped in for lunch with a friend who works down the street and I was very very impressed. Fresh Thai food with an attention to detail that is a step above Le Thai downtown....and corkage is $10...what more do you want...., 1
Friendly front desk staff and a solid room for an affordable price.  They also have a pretty solid free breakfast bar., 1
The Herb Box is a great place to go for food in Old Town. I usually go in the market for a sandwich during lunch, 1
Friday night date night. Fish fry. Drinks. Great ambiance and Bartender.  This is my second time here; we were in the mood for fish and decided to check out reviews and decided on B&H.  Once we entered, 1
The food here is amazing. Great customer service. Food came right out, 1
This is our favorite place to have lunch when we're cruising the strip and not wanting to stuff ourselves.   On our first trip here we had what we thought was going to be a plate of nachos, 1
So excited for another Mexican food place to open in my hood. Coke products, 1
Why would you rate a Bojangles? Well-I have never had a friendlier staff in one of these types of restaurants. It is fast-food with more than a smile. The service was quick and the order correct!  The biscuits are fabulous! Slight spice to the breading on the chicken-not too much. The cole-slaw was good. The mashed potatoes and gravy were okay-I'll go for something else next trip!  Clean, 1
An out and out gem - the quality and the portions at this place blow my mind, 1
Get there early on Sunday morning to beat the crowd.  Toast provides coffee while you do wait!!!!, 1
Barbacoa. Amazing Pork Barbacoa.  The Good: The salads turn into giant glorious burritos. Everything is made in front of you so you can adjust what and how much of it is put into your food. Tortillas made right in front of your face. Every 10th meal free! Free Food for kids. The Tomatillo ranch is exquisite! The first time my brain ever said "Google this shit and see if we can make it home.". So yes, 1
Really lovely, 1
I went here with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday-June '08.  Good food as expected but damn...hella expensive! Peppered Crispy Shrimp for $26?   Dessert was very yummy! I forgot exactly  what I ordered but it was chocolate and again-yummy!  If your looking to splurge for Chinese food...this is the place to go., 1
I absolutely LOVE this mall! It has a range of stores for every interest and every budget. It is a gigantic, 1
first time having italian beef.  This was pretty fantastic., 1
just found aromas last night, 1
Have to give props to the person(people) who is keeping this place running.  There are plenty of machines that made flashback to my younger days.  Of course, 1
Very pleasantly surprised!   The Food Exceeded my expectations.  I had the Pasta Primavera with chicken and my husband had the burger. We shared both and they were very well made.  And the food came out in a timely manner. Our waiter was very attentive. We had the brownie and house made ice cream. We were very happy we changed our plans of where we were going to go and came here., 1
My wife and I found this place while trying to find a spot to watch NFL (our team).   We had tried Lagasse's stadium but it was jammed packed, 1
I heard that this was hard to get into, 1
Just moved here from Baltimore and ran across this place.  Love it!  Watch yourself at the hot bar.  There's no scale (should be).  Your mea l(of veggies, 1
Had an amazing meal with a friend. Sat on the patio which was nice but the service was slow - it was the middle of the day on a Monday.. typically not a 'busy' day/time. Had the pasta fagioli soup, 1
They are in the great service business. The clothes are great, 1
Grubbed with the hubs here. Good burgers & trying new bread pudding - not yet on the menu., 1
Best farmers market in AZ! Love the selection of local vendors and fresh produce. The samples are great! I usually go in the morning and end up having my breakfast from the different samples. Also the atmosphere is great too! Lots of talkative friendly people.   If you haven't been yet....go!!!, 1
Great local bar for beer lovers.Real beer., 1
We were staying at the Ritz and wanted a nice breakfast. We really enjoyed our experience. Overall we had  good service and the food was very good. I had perfectly cooked eggs and my SO  had French toast. The prices were pretty reasonable too!, 1
Amazing restaurant. I took my gf here for her birthday, 1
I had the prosciutto wrapped Atlantic salmon and it was perfection. The poached pear martini was delicious. The bread was served with a bean dip that was pretty dull and the place was extremely dark, 1
One of my all-time favorite restaurants, 1
I just moved here from California and was happy to find this nail salon! They are quick, 1
The best Mexican food I had at Madison! I am a vegetarian and I would go back to them anytime I craved for Mexican. Loved it always..., 1
Ok we love this place been coming here for years. Well they just remodeled the place and it looks great came here a month ago food is still good. But the service is slowing down. Today dec 2 the service really was bad we waited to get seated about 10 mins and it took another 25 mins to get our food but overall it was good and service did come around.   Food is always been good. I'll be back    I'll give it 4 stars cause I like the place.   But if the service doesn't come up.  No matter how great the food is its not worth it coming back, 1
Although the location is less-than-obvious, 1
Good southern veggies - much better than a local soul food place (I won't name names but last name of Ethyl and Fred on I Love Lucy is a hint). I Liked the black eyed peas. Green beans were good but a little bland. Liked the Jalape\u00f1o cornbread. (they have plain cornbread too). Yams were sweet but good and like a dessert.   The chicken and sausage gumbo soup of the day was flavorful.  The fried chicken looked pretty good. I wish they offered a chicken fried chicken breast (no bones) with gravy.   This place gets super crowded at lunch, 1
Really cool lounge/ bar/ diner-type of place., 1
Not many bad things to say- chips weren't hot and needed a little salt but main dish was amazing.You have the choice of whole wheat or white flour, 1
J'adore cette place, 1
The cons to Red Rock Casino are what make the pros to it as well. It's FAR from most areas in Vegas, 1
I just love everything about this place. The location, 1
Located on the east side of 7th St. just south of Thomas.  Another homey little cottage with hardwood floors.  Consistently good food at moderate prices keeps this place busy the only days of the week they're open for dinner, 1
I appreciate the education I'm getting at such a good price. The classes are challenging in a good way. If only we would become more acclaimed by the time I graduate that'd be great!, 1
Let me just start off by saying that I was surprised and pleased with this restaurant.   I have been here twice. The 1st time I had already eaten and was just going on an impromptu visit with a friend to meet other friends.   I wish I hadn't already eaten the first time: the food looked delectable.  The second time I insisted my boyfriend and I go there when were downtown buying records at Revolver (another good place to go).   I'm vegetarian and there were some, 1
First time to stay at this hotel. We came for a convention. Simple and elegant is how I will describe the room (nothing over the top).The room is  nice and Good size.  The bathrooms are well appointed too.We had the view of the pool area and mountains.  Since we came here for a convention, 1
The food was phenomenal, 1
Question, 1
Shoku ramen is so good! On my first visit there the waitress explained exactly how to make the spicy ramen vegan, 1
Cool cowboy bar. Standard stop when in Carefree., 1
Awesome outfits. White collars blue shirts, 1
i've only been here once and it was a few yrs ago. From what i remember i enjoyed everything, 1
LOVE!  I've stayed here twice so far, 1
this place is good, 1
Chase Field was stop #22 on my families mlb park tour, 1
Really cute place to bring the kids! Our two year old had a blast, 1
I had a good experience at this club. My boyfriend and I got in for free so we can't complain much. I was really satisfied with the music and the DJ. The only downside is that I like to drink and lounge around with friends and dance in between drinks. No place to lounge around and drinks start of from $20 per drink including bottled beer., 1
Now let me start by saying I have passed this establishment on MANY occasions over the last 4 years. I am heading to Alaska pretty soon for vacation and I needed to find some gloves and maybe some insulated jeans. I thought of other locations.....looked online but it was my wife that mentioned Cabela's and I was like sure let me go and check them out. Well I have to tell you I was thoroughly impressed by the place.  When I walked in I was amazed out how bright and clean the place was and to my shock when I walked a few steps to the right there was an AQUARIUM......that's right an actual AQUARIUM.....how awesome is that. Everything in the store is clearly defined and the Presentation is some of the best I have EVER seen for ANY store. They have 2 completely separate areas to display there boats.....they have a huge clearance area on the second floor......and there is even a cafe up there if your hungry.   There is also a great exhibit in there that features a replica of the Arizona Mountain landscape with fake bears.....deer.....and other wildllife. There are plenty of people there to assist you in finding anything you need and I walked out of there with a great deal and a new Credit Card that they make right on Sight.....WOW!!!!! Not sure how much I will use it....but since it provides points as a reward.....it has an extremely low FIXED interest rate.....and NO ANNUAL FEE......well I probably will use it some.....LOL!!!  Basically this establishment will become my go to place for some excellent apparel....they have all the items I really like......and I can't wait to next fall because I know they will have some awesome items during the holiday season. Now this is still a store with a dominant focus on hunting....fishing....and outdoor adventure.....but it has something for EVERYONE. Eat, 1
What is not to like! Best Chicago beef and Chicago hot dogs in Arizona. It is almost always crowded but the service is great- - whether going through the drive through or eating inside.....prices are fair and the food is plentiful. I've had a couple of the salads too and they are delicious also., 1
Arrived at the airport early and needed some food before my flight.  I was dreading the typical airport food.  One look at the Chophouse menu and it had a ray of light.  Sat down and ordered a Kona Longboard which was on draft.  Started with the crab cake, 1
Was visiting family in Vegas when my niece anther famil brought this popcorn over.  I luved it. I can't wait for my order to show up...., 1
Went here on a Friday night and it was seafood night. Hot and Cold Crab legs, 1
Love this hotel and The Venetian.  Stayed here several times in the last 3 years.  I always love going to the pool.  Morels Rest. has excellent stakes and great wine selection.  The lobby is beautiful and connection to the Venetian makes the walking experience great.  The beds are comfortable and the bathroom are big.   TIP TIP TIP;  When going from the Airport to your Hotel on the Strip...tell the taxi guy to NOT take the Interstate...take back streets - you get there faster and cheaper., 1
A lovely museum with great exhibitions, 1
This place is freaking fantastic, 1
I finally understood what the Israelis were talking abou when they said that there wasn't any good shawarma in Vegas. This relatively new place gave me a taste of Israel. Defiantly check it out. Best Israeli food in Vegas., 1
The park is huge.  The other dogs are fun and my girls always enjoy coming here when we are visiting the family in East Mesa.  Wish they had dog parks like this in SoCA.    Solid 4.5 stars., 1
About two weeks ago, 1
I've been eating and drinking at Glass Nickel for many years.  The waitstaff is wonderful, 1
LOVE this gym!! I travel to Vegas a lot for business and I've been going there since they opened. Everything is brand-new, 1
I have used A To Z Housekeeping a couple of times and have always been happy with the results. I appreciate the professionalism and excellent customer service: appointments are routinely confirmed, 1
B28.  Sounds like bingo but it was my position in line to get on the plane home.  Ok I am not crazy about standing in line and hoping to get an aisle or window but once on the plane the crew made for a fun trip.  I had plenty of room for my knees and the peanuts helped a few minutes pass.  I do think most people know they have to check in 24 hours prior to flight.  If  not they get C on their boarding pass which really means middle seat. This is ok if your traveling with someone you know.  This is my choice of airlines if possible., 1
Friendly and informative front desk staff, 1
What a great place!  I spend way too much money here on a weekly basis.  I believe I have tried nearly everything and have yet to be dissappointed.  My advice is to try it all and enjoy!, 1
We have a dog that doesn't like anything about getting groomed. The people at Love A Pup are so great with him! If you want your dog groomed by someone who really loves dogs, 1
Love the area that this cafe is in. The tea and macaroons are to die for! The decorations and vibe this place has is fantastic. I'm upset that they don't have one closer to me. Definitely a place that I'd come by and do homework in while drinking tea!, 1
Very good tacos would be a good way to start this review. They have alot of them in all forms available and whatever protein you can think of also. They also have American food like burgers, 1
One of my new favorite restuarants in Phoenix.. along with Switch and Fez this is owned by the same people.  The food was fabulous and the service was great.  Tom one of the owners is an awesome guy.  Will definately go back again and again., 1
I don't shop in Marks and Spencers for clothes as I haven't reached forty and don't have three kids. But I do love:   1. Their underwear department. There always seems to be a sale section full of ridiculous bargains. I got a bra in here for 98p. 98p! How many things can you still buy for 98p? As a bargain hunter, 1
Nice casino and its even better now that the renovation are done. It is a bit confusing because they moved everything around but the staff is very helpful. I like that they have the self serve station so you don't have to wait for the person to come around with the cart anymore.  Tried all the restaurants in the place and they are decent but not the greatest. The buffet is very pricey and not worth it at all. The one beside that is somewhat set up like a cafeteria is ok but again very expensive for what you get. The one thing I enjoy the most for that place is the club sandwich and the portion is pretty decent. My mom gets invited to a bday dinner every year and they serve 4 course meal with all you can drink wine.  The service is always very good and they always set it up like a little gala. I enjoy it every time and I hope they keep inviting us., 1
Good appetizers, 1
I was actually on my way to another bar when I was passing Pub Quartier Latin. I decided to stop in before heading out any further on Rue Ontario Est.  I was greeted by the bartender with enthusiasm, 1
It's pretty tasty stuff! They offer some interesting pizzas and the ingredients are usually pretty fresh. Sometimes if you go in at kind of a slow hour and get a slice, 1
I tried 5 different types of tacos: Beef head, 1
Best bar staff  and just all around a great place!, 1
Quirky fun and awesome sliders.  I've always loved the truck and this location manages to capture most of the charm.  The mystery slider can be fun but choose at your own risk.  It is a little hit or miss.  The Barby is the whole reason to eat here.  It is a perfect combination of flavors that always has me coming back., 1
Been here many times. Always great and fun., 1
The sushi rice was a bit dry, 1
I like this Target store, 1
My dad insisted on going to this place after seeing it advertise in the Thai newspaper for months. so we went and the guy from the newspaper came out and served us it was the owner. Watching him work and how he cared about his place was very refreshing. the food is as good or if not better than the ones in Thai town. bring your friends for karaoke and party atmosphere at night.., 1
I was just looking at the pictures I took when I was here last year and realized I had never gotten my review written.  I was just driving by and spotted this place and decided to try it out.  I was impressed there were mostly Latinos in there, 1
I've been dying to try Honey Pig forever.....  As Honey T. had said, 1
My husband is a Nascar fan so when our family vacation in Vegas landed on his birthday, 1
I've been through better but this one aint bad.  I love the smell of airports too.  It reminds me of going somewhere fun.  At least it does since I don't travel for work anymore.  Sky Harbor has the average food choices, 1
Amidst the abundance of pawn shops, 1
WOW.  This place really makes AYCE sushi unique.  Not only are there the usual crazy rolls deep fried/sauce to the extreme/yadda yadda, 1
This place is delicious! I love the pan roast! I always crave this stuff  but unfortunately they don't have one when I live in San Diego. Hopefully they will open one there one day! Yes, 1
I give this place 4 stars for their bubble tea and appetizers, 1
This rating is based solely on today's experience. I went through the drive-through and there was only one other person in front of me. I clearly understood what they said on the speaker. The two ladies were nice enough out the window. They were fast and efficient. I was able to use my free beverage coupon from my rewards membership. That was easy and I paid just over a dollar for two medium drinks. Can't beat that!  I typically try to avoid this location because of past experiences. Hopefully the service stays as it was today., 1
Love this place! Has a great atmosphere and everyone here is always so pleasant! Food is good and the wine is wonderful!, 1
Found this on Yelp! and had dinner there last night. All three of us love Indian food and don't get to enjoy it very often. This place is great; we loved it. A magnificent buffet at a reasonable price. And even with a buffet, 1
This was the 2nd time at this nice bring your own bottle place.  There is a provincial liquor store across the street and we chose a Mouton Rothchild white and a 2004 Chateau Labegorce Margaux red.  To start, 1
It's not this HD in particular but all locations..every employee knows where everything is in the store. & that is so impressive to me cause there is so much stuff in HD!, 1
Lobbys makes my favorite burger in the valley.  They use fresh beef, 1
Go Raw is a small cafe that I discovered upon moving into The Lakes housing community about two years ago.  Everything is raw, 1
I have a 2014 Impreza and I love it. I had a really good buying experience. They don't hassle you at all, 1
Great place to run it goes through tempe town lake and for really long runs you can go from tempe to scottsdale and take all the underpasses which is extremely convenient. I do wish it were better lot on some areas especially early in the morning., 1
Just experienced Block & Grinder's new brunch menu. There aren't enough stars! SO amazing! Premier service! AmAZing food! Had Shrimp & Grits with scallops and venison sausage. DANK! Tasted the Duck Hash. SUPERB! And their Potato Cakes are like nothing I've had before, 1
I needed to get 2 pairs of work pants and my lululemon yoga pants hemmed....where to go?  After a quick yelp search, 1
I have been to Good Foot Spa twice now, 1
I love Egg Works, 1
what a beautiful place.  I was here for a ballroom competition.  the service and ambiance were great but the food was terrible.  didn't matter where we went to eat it was terrible all through the resort.  so go for looks but not for eats, 1
We stopped in for a drink during the game and this place was pretty cool. It was fairly empty at the time because they were hosting a high school reunion, 1
Damn this is a lot of choice for food.  No wonder I stayed for 1.5  hours.     Pricy but worth it.  I will be going back, 1
Has there ever been a time where you were craving great street tacos, 1
We ate here before the Improv at Harrah's and it worked out perfectly. Still a little slowish on a Wed night and we had wonderful service from Sammy and basically just ordered everything he recommended, 1
Their portions are small but very flavorful. The inside alone is breathtakingly gorgeous!! Waiter is very knowledgeable, 1
This place has every nut, 1
I've eaten here twice and def will return.  We usually get a pitcher of martgarita on the rocks which hits the spot.  I would then recommend the fajitas, 1
A regular burger that tasted not like cafeteria food but Great. It had the usual suspects on it, 1
I came here at the recommendation and glowing review of Yelp's own Rachel!  I was not disappointed.  Heather, 1
Went on a Saturday night with a group of 8.....with such a large group, 1
What a surprising treat! I had seen a good restaurant come and go in this location so in an effort to support the newcomer, 1
We had a religious experience with our pizza.  Enough said., 1
Incroyable Brunch \u00e0 la bo\u00eete Gourmande, 1
This place is my first recommendation to anyone going to Vegas. When you enter this brick-walled, 1
I love this place! The casino floor is smallish, 1
This is a great spot to chill and have a good drink. The mojito I had was awesome! I had to knock off a star bc the service is sometimes iffy and it's closed for private parties more than I would like.  But the music is good, 1
For me Betty is THE BEST!! My puppy TOFI loves her!! The staff is amazing and the service too!!! I always left Tofi with her when my husband and I need to be out of the city and when I pick him up he is always happy!!!  Betty You are the best!!!!!, 1
Although Sal's is a "Deli" i really consider it a restaurant with some deli tendencies. They have both a carry out service and a sit down restaurant.  Service through both is good. Though I prefer to sit down and order with a waitress, 1
The entire experience was exceptional.  I travel a lot for work and try new places and gamble on a great experience. Let me tell you, 1
During the visit to Raku in Jun, 1
Good things first:  -Food was DELICIOUS! We loved everything we ate. Tempura green beans were super yum, 1
Had a couple bad experiences with vendors stating they could not reach our condo due to it's distance from the parking lot. Called Robert who stated it would be no problem. He arrived on time and did a great job with the filthy carpet left behind by the previous owner. Not only that but he was the highest value of anyone I contacted. I would definitely recommend him to firends/family., 1
I love this place! My home away from home. I was in two separate car accidents last year about two weeks apart. Both were not my fault. I have a case with my attorney opened and was referred to ace chiropractic. I have been going here for a year now usually one to two times per week. The staff is great! Very friendly and professional. Dr. Bozeman definitely goes the extra mile to make sure you are getting the best care. Not only from his staff but from the rest of the people that you deal with throughout the process of a lean or auto accident. He really cares and helps you understand anything that you may have questions about. I will always recommend ACE CHIROPRACTIC to ALL of my friends and family. I really appreciate everything you guys have done for me. :-), 1
Excellent dinner and service!  Romantic atmosphere!! Can't wait to come back to Vegas to dine here again!!, 1
BEST JUKE EVA. People watching on the particular night my friends and I popped into this bar was highly entertaining, 1
Selection deserves five stars, 1
Very good food. The service was spectacular. I had the lunch green curry and my sister had the lunch pad Thai. Both came with salad, 1
Just had an awesome burger for $5 and service was quick and friendly- definitely coming back - good selection of beer and lots of TVs. The waitress was definitely a plus. Good live music on the weekends too. The food was much better than what I expected. Went with my wife and daughter and we were all pleased with our main course and my wife ordered the chicken pot pie that was delicious., 1
Needed my oil changed before a road trip and they fit me in before closing.... Great service!!, 1
my dinner/experience here was was just fabulous.  From my experience, 1
I am a big fan of curry corner. They have the best Indian/Pakistani food in Tempe. I am a big fan of the chicken tikka masala, 1
The Homewood in Happy Valley rules.    My company has an office based in Phoenix and Homewood happy Valley is normally where they put me up since I have to bring my crazy puppy for the extended stays and they allow pets.   The staff is amazing and put up with so many of my crazy antics over my 2 months stint.  I did my best to keep them on their toes and they gave me a run for my money.   The rooms were very clean, 1
Wonderful food staff is friendly and efficient I would definitely do it again portions are big prices are good, 1
Just moved to Las Vegas and discovered my old dealer in Cali is affiliated with the two local dealers. This was a relief. The Fletcher Jones experience was as usual .  Amazing!!!!!!!! In .....Out........went above and beyond as usual, 1
Coming from Seattle, 1
I'm Vegas for the Pizza show and staying a the Encore.  I had just came in from the airport and I was starving so I had checked in and headed to the room and then I saw the Wazuzu Thai restaurant and thought I would get a bite to eat. The room is very nice and the service was also exceptional. I had the drunken Noodles with chicken.  This noodle dish is one of my favorite and I try to eat every where I go, 1
We have visited Thailand many times and love the food.  So, 1
Strike another one from the Bookmarks list.  I think about the things that attract me to any given bar: * a good cocktail list (check: 107 has a decent selection of martinis and specialty cocktails) * bargains (check: 2 for 1 martinis, 1
wow.  overall great food, 1
Everytime I came to Vegas, 1
Yar, 1
This hotel is nice. The staff is quite attentive, 1
Even though the Mirage is under construction in many areas, 1
Daphne's has very tasty, 1
Been going to this location all football season, 1
One of my favorite places on the South Side.  The food is original.  I usually get the Stilton Stuffed Chicken, 1
I am so happy that this place is so close to home.  And so cost friendly for good products.  It is a clean store with a multitude of useful products and friendly staff.   My favorite thing to buy here is Hand Sanitizer in the big pumps lol., 1
Wow! Great place. Love the menu and how different this place is to other restaurants. The atmosphere is very down to earth. Food is great. Will be back and will recommend., 1
I have eaten here several times over the years, 1
Finally trying this place out for a quite girls night out. First, 1
went here for the first time and enjoyed several of their rolls. not Bad. My problem is that I was there to relax and eat sushi. There was maybe 5 or 6 older guys in there getting pretty drunk at the sushi bar and then entered a loud and drunk woman. They all started hitting on her, 1
$5 per piece of salmon sashimi. YIKES!  Definitely expensive but OMG was it the most delicious, 1
Vapiano is like a beautiful little European import, 1
I had heard all the possible hyperbole about Bianco being the best pizza in the world or at least the US. So when I got to SD on business I checked it out. Let me say that yes the pizza is good. Hard to say if it is the best pizza I have ever had and to be fair the owner does not promote this. I like thin margarita style pizza and this is what i got. I am a big eater so I ordered two large as the pizza is so thin it isn't a whole lot of food or for me very filling. I would say that the pizza is worth dining here. Will I go back? Probably if it is convenient. Pricy I spent $70.00 with tip for 2 large pies and a few beers but you get what you pay for. Everything is fresh and artisan. I think you should go and judge for yourself., 1
Lawry's Las Vegas offers the excellent prime rib you'd expect from a Lawry's! That said, 1
Fat Tuesday is my favorite place to get a drink to walk around and get drunk with. I prefer the 44 Magnum, 1
Equipment is new and up to date. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Frequent specials going on. They are also very flexible with scheduling, 1
Amazing Mac and cheese and burritos. You have to patiently wait for a table to open up, 1
Great location. Very fun. They had a lady there singing was was pretty neat. The place was packed. We had a blast. If your in the area, 1
I never thought the day would come when I'd be writing a review about fast food.   Here is the deal, 1
Overall I really love this joint. Their subs are delicious, 1
We bought the white chocolate chip macadamia cookie and chocolate malt crunch ice cream. Delicious., 1
Great lunch. I had the Cullen skink and ham sandwich. Both were excellent. I would highly recommend this for lunch., 1
My favorite place in Vegas!!!!!!!! When iI lived in the neighborhood I went there like 2 or 3 times a week. While I've had better sushi, 1
Stayed at the Delano recently in a recently renovated room. The new rooms are really nice in my opinion. Delano really feels upscale. If you're an average joe like me, 1
I like this place.  It's very good pizza and salads, 1
After delta and united delayed my bags by several hours I have a great appreciation for southwest. I have flown with them more than any other airline since they have more options when flying to CA. They have not yet lost my luggage (knock on wood)..the seats aren't the best but i can live with that on short flights. Not having to pay the extra $25 for checking in luggage is a huge plus. The employees seem to be happier (compared to delta and jet blue) and the flight attendants are usually friendly (9 out of 10). The pilots usually get us to the destination city on time or a few min earlier., 1
Nice movie theatre that plays the newest movies, 1
I got the Pad Thai because I like to use it as a comparison plate that all Thai places have. Their Pad Thai was flavorful, 1
Great first time experience! Awesome customer service and they are all very helpful and friendly! And cheap!, 1
=====================BREAKFAST ================================  My sister Mindy, 1
PC Cops are GREAT! The response time is fantastic. They really know what they are doing and they do it fast, 1
We've been coming to Skyland's for years and it's always great! We usually come for breakfast as a family. You never know who you're going to run into. This place and The Original Pancake House (South Park) are historic landmarks! Great food with a home cooked feel/taste at cheap prices! Ask for Stacey. She's lovely with a great personality. Be ready for her, 1
I really love this place it was suprisinlgy good and you get a lot portion for the money. It is packed so there maybe a wait but overall a really good place to try, 1
Great food for affordable price.. Love there aloo tikki, 1
A diamond in the rough!  Mesa is not exactly an ethnic restaurant hot spot.  It is really hard to find anything decent, 1
I hired Brianna to do hair and makeup for me, 1
The Mrs. and I hit this place twice in a week when we were in the area for a class.  We came armed with Groupons both times - never leave a deal behind!  The carne asada is every bit as good as they say, 1
As always outstanding food and service. We've been dining here for over a  year now and we have never been disappointed! The food has always been spectacular and the ambiance of the restaurant fabulous. I highly reccomend this restaurant for authentic Italian dining. The owner really takes pride in providing a fabulous dining experience for his guest and it shows. We can't wait to go back!, 1
We've been using Delia's since they opened at this location, 1
I went here for the first time a couple of days ago. I used to live at the apartments right down the street and still never came here until recently. I went with a friend and when we walked in, 1
Great atmosphere and really yummy food!, 1
First time here. Walked in and there was no other diners. A little concerned until we received our food.  Delicious BBQ and the side dishes were equally delicious. Our 5 year old son loved his chicken sandwich. We will be back again we love to support local Businesses rather than big chains., 1
This place is way better than Diva Beauty. Although, 1
I've always been a fan of the in between a cafe and a bar stance, 1
Stayed at the hotel recently and tried this place and was pleasantly surprised. The food depending on what you order is average to very good depending on WHAT you order. The staff was pleasant the prices were good for those on a budget. I saw a big guy order the Macadamia pancakes (full order) and he maybe at a 1/3 because it was such a huge order. Unless you are sharing or starving order  the smaller stack. The prime rib and omelette's were good and the real deal is midnight to 6 am when they have some serious super savers on food.  ., 1
Stayed here when I went on a family vacation to Vegas.  We were given a room with a view of the strip and an even more amazing view of the erupting volcano.  On top of that, 1
Still dreaming of the lobster gnocchi!!!   Delicious!   Service was excellent and we all received a complimentary glass of champaign with our dessert!  Excellent Italian food!!!, 1
One of my FAV Cirque shows?  Easy....it's O!!  Little play on the French word "eau" (water) and the show is totally set in water....brilliant!   Eau = O.....those funny people!   The stage is ginormous & absolutely mind-boggling! Goes from this 1.5 MILLION gallon tank to a completely dry set w/ peeps running & tumbling all over the place, 1
Working with Let ThemEat Cake (And Barbara too) was a pleasure. They were so sweet. I let them run with the creativity of the cake since I'm not creative and they exceeded my expectations! The cake was the Ninja Turtles coming out of a sewer. They made it gluten free (vanilla) with Pineapple and custard in the middle and it was a HUGE hit at my sons 4th b-day party. No one would have ever known it was gluten free if I didn't say anything and everyone asked me several times where I had the cake made. Writing this post is making me crave another piece!, 1
I absolutely love bagels. I know they are not the best for me and I don't care. They are just the perfect carb (which is certainly stiff competition). And I will admit, 1
I recommend this urgent care. We are pretty picky and this facility is clean, 1
A gorgeous view of old Montreal and a fun environment! I ordered a savoury and sweet crepe which complimented each other well! The waiter was very friendly and I enjoyed the food! The best part is the scenery though! A wonderful location!, 1
I love Little Darlings!  I've spent several days in the club.  And I got a lot of action.  It's a dirty little place with $20 lapdances in the back, 1
The secret to a good bagel is the water.  You can't replicate a NYC bagel without the water.  However, 1
Same Day Service! Donny from Swimming Pool Butler saved my swamp of a pool after that crazy dust storm. He was very friendly, 1
my husband and I ordered oeufs fameux with fromage and  Benedict montreal smoked meat.  They are quite good.  Better than the same food in other restaurant.  If I have to say what are not perfect on our plates are the patates rissolees and the Hollandais sauce.  The tates of the ppotatos are good and special, 1
Good food excellent service.  Egg drop soup was well done and didn't taste like it was made from a package like some places.  General Tso's chicken like said by others had no spice but was tasty and well prepared.  Fried rice was cooked well.  I wasn't impressed by the crab rangoon as I'm usually very critical on that dish as I cook my own Chinese food and normally avoid anything I make myself on a regular basis .  Dine in area was very small but clean and staff was friendly.  Much better than going to a big box like panda express.  Worth a look if your in the area and want to try something new., 1
A recent Brunch on the patio at Cornerstone was lovely. Weather permitting, 1
Such a subjective topic to Yelp about- but to score a "First, 1
A convenient AAA location. They have a kiosk where I was able to pay my registration and get my tags in 5 minutes flat. I was in and out in no time and I would have been quicker if I didn't have some trouble with the machine. Luckily an employee came to my rescue quickly and was helpful and friendly., 1
Tasty soy mocha, 1
If you have a thousand bucks in disposable income, 1
We sat in the sun next to a fountain and drank bottomless mimosas.  Awesome!  But really, 1
Best dinner we had during our trip to Vegas. Went there for my boyfriend's birthday and it was just PERFECT. Starting from chef Jimmy to the sommelier and the waiters staff, 1
Carnevino is the best Steakhouse in Vegas, 1
If you like donuts, 1
My cat had a lion cut done here today. I have no complaints. I bought the groupon for $39 which included the bath, 1
I rarely ever give 5 stars as that requires service above and beyond in my opinion. However I must say that Posidon deserves that 5th star.  How do you get a 5th star? Well you start off with friendly wait staff. Throw in fresh vegetables, 1
Went today for lunch and got fried chicken and pork chop dinners. Food was delicious and service was great. Angie's mom is the best., 1
If you go expecting a typical deli experience, 1
A rally great happy hour with most of the steaks being 50% off.  I enjoyed a solid flat iron for $14.99, 1
One of my favorite happy hour spots.  Half off drinks and selected appetizers with a pretty quality beer selection.    Have eaten in the restaurant for a few work functions.  Food is good but the prices are a little steep.    Highly recommend the bar and happy hour.  Great atmosphere and the music on Fridays and Saturdays are awesome., 1
Attached to the Flamingo a great place to relax away from the mobs., 1
Cirque d Soleil does no wrong in my book. Every show I have seen has totally blown me away. LOVE was AMAZING. I love the Beatles and combined with Cirque was 100% pure amazing in my book.   I really enjoyed how they captured each Beatles song with dancing, 1
Went with my sister last night...it was amazing and the price was perfect for AYCE. We loved the side items and the sushi and rolls. Although it is a tight squeeze of a place, 1
We were looking for a place to just hangout and drink and we found it. We went there yesterday (Monday) and there were only a couple of other people in there besides our group of three. The selection on the jukebox was decent and we were able to find music that we wanted to listen to. Georgia is a great bartender and was so friendly and nice. It was a good night., 1
My eye needs have been met here at elite eye care for the last two years.. The staff are friendly and are receptive to appointments via email or phone. The doctor is professional and informative. They even send you a survey the next day for feedback on their service, 1
This place is hard to find tucked away in commercial pad with Urgent Care, 1
I spent a week in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel for NYE this year. It was not my first visit to Nobu, 1
I'm surprised at the negative reviews here.   My experience with Dr. Woodson and his staff has been so positive thus far. Dr. Woodson was very kind, 1
Really? I have forgotten to review this truck AND nobody else has? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!  The burgers (and other items) from Fuku Burger are a perfect balance of Asian infused burgers. Their 'crack sauce' is seriously addicting, 1
This review is for the Fab Luxury rooms. Our room was overlooking the strip so no complaints about the view. There was some street noise, 1
Came here for the 1st time on Sunday after a sleepless night. I was starving and wanted a quick breakfast that was on the way home because I was really wanting to finally get some sleep. It was 7 am and this seemed to be the only place open in Chinatown so it was my perfect opportunity to finally try it.  I was craving pho the last couple weeks which naturally guided me to select from the pho section of their extensive menu. I went with a #13 which was a beef combination pho and included meatballs, 1
Although this place was very good, 1
I thoroughly enjoyed everything.  Cute little place, 1
My best friend and I came here for their Halloween themed paint session. I bought the groupon as a gift for her birthday. The experience here was AMAZING!! The staff here went above and beyond, 1
Meeeeattttttt!!!!!!  While this wasn't my first visit to Chima's, 1
Man I wish there was a place like this in LA!!!  It's CLEAN! Complimentary fancy drinks and fresh baked cookies. It has mirrored furniture I wanna take home LOL JK. Most importantly seems like an honest place won't add on extras or BS thaturcar is messed up. The prices are amazing and even more straight forward :) I think I'll have to drive here from LA every time I need any kind of service :), 1
I have been receiving eyelash service from Eyelash Power for 5 years, 1
I just realized that I've eaten here at least 16 times...wonder why I'm getting a little chubby? I've got to say that the service, 1
Not to bad! It is hard to find good pizza in Phoenix/Tempe, 1
I'm obsessive when it comes to tacos, 1
So good customer service *inserts DOGE face*...But seriously, 1
Great customer service.  They had a lens there that was sold out EVERYWHERE.  The only places that had it in stock were marking it up 2x the retail.  B&C were honest and sold it for the retail price even though no one else was.  Thank you., 1
Jenni at the Southwest airlines helping my daughter and I check was fast(which I like) and very helpful. The guy checking us in at gate 11 not friendly and not very helpful., 1
Choisit par hasard lors de notre passage sur St-Laurent.  Nourriture excellente.  Plus raffin\u00e9 que la cuisine Tha\u00eflandaise que l'on retrouve couramment.  Endroit sympathique et tr\u00e8s propre.  D\u00e9cor agr\u00e9able.  Vous pouvez apporter votre vin., 1
Great tortillas  I had the three tacos de Assad combo and got me a free churro with my order. A+ in my book., 1
Biggie (English Bulldog, 1
It's your typical, 1
Nice restaurant for a quick lunch or dinner near George Sq. The owner/waitress is character but it only adds to the authenticity of the place. Try the aubergine hotpot, 1
Great burgers and fries, 1
I had a really enjoyable stay at this hotel.  The rooms were very clean and the interior was modern. The bed was your typical nice hotel bed, 1
Tonsof selection, 1
For Las Vegas, 1
For an Indian who craves good Indian food, 1
The short stack sweet potato pancakes were fantastic. There were chicks of sweet potato in the pancakes, 1
The guys at Xpress Lube do a great job and are super friendly. While some people have commented that it's pricey, 1
Several visits ..All aspects top rate..Wine, 1
I was vegan for years, 1
One of my reliable places to go for lunch or dinner. I wasn't too happy when they changed their menu a while back but now I have gotten used to it and have my new favorites to choose from. I just wish that they still had Cholula Hot Sauce. The service is always friendly though and even when the lines are long they move along fairly quickly except for the occasional moron that doesn't think about looking at the menu until the last minute. Or the moron that can't seem to decide from which of the soups he would like to dip his sandwich into., 1
5 stars for the customer service (thanks lili) 4 stars for the food  5 stars for the apple pie & coconut cream .... Goodness... And perfect bacon.   Did not like the old diner old old feel. I'm a stickler about clean glassware and utensils and everything was so outdated & used so much 1/3 of the logo is left - as clean as it may have been - felt unclean.   I got a veggie omelet - super delish and they use whole florets - cooled perfectly.  Bacon - perfect & crispy .... So Worth the calories.   They vale all of their desserts there and everything we ordered was incredible. Pie crust was flakey and soft - I would come here again - staff is super friendly., 1
I love the deep fried potato taco and Grilled Fish Tostada bowl (no tostada)!  Chronic Cantina is fast and delicious and located just up the street from my office.  The staff is always super cool and helpful., 1
We just came back from our first time at India Oven but not the first time we have had Indian food.    We both got the buffet, 1
I was waiting in the check out line at Basha's and the latest edition of Phoenix Magazine caught my eye with the headline "21 Best Sandwiches". Being a huge sandwich lover, 1
Love love looove this salon! Oh did I mention I love this salon? I have been going here since 2006 and my stylist Dianna is just amazing! She spends a lot of time on my hair and I have never been disappointed. Plus the way she does my highlights allows me to go quite a long time without going back and it will still look great. I always get complimented on my hair and have referred a few people here that now love it too! Will never ever let someone else touch my hair., 1
Le Petit Hotel sits on a tight, 1
I just experienced the food from this place for the first time. We did take-out and I really enjoyed it.  We ordered the Mediterranean pizza and wings. The wings were great. The pizza was great as well except their was quite a bit of mozerella cheese and I almost choked 2x's trying to swallow the chunk of cheese. This wouldn't discourage me from eating it again, 1
Awesome place! Love the revolving menu. The Tres leche w rhubarb was to die for. Highly recommend it!, 1
So I had to hit the oldest Irish pub in Montreal.  I really liked this place.  Multiple levels, 1
Solid club. Good crowd and great DJ.   Drinks are fairly expensive but no more than any other Vegas club., 1
I own a house in Tempe, 1
The ladies there are very helpful, 1
Worth a visit simply for the best fried calamari I've ever eaten and the Matilda draft. The 3 cheese panini with tomato soup was great as well., 1
I love the Wynn hotel. It is beautiful..   The uniforms the hostess wear at the Wynn def do not match the ambiance of the rest of the hotel. They are ill-fitting and unattractive. The whole place gives you a very Alice in Wonderland feel, 1
Cute clothes....most of the time. It sucks though cuz every time i find something, 1
I love this location.  I have had many issues with Firehouse locations (the one on S. Rainbow comes to mind, 1
Je situe le d\u00e9cors: \u00e0 votre droite un mur de briques apparentes, 1
For those of you who like to explore the North Side like myself you are always looking for new and exciting things that remind you why this side of the city is so great. Java House for those who aren't familiar used to be named "The Vault" and is located right on California Ave. The new owners have done a marvelous job bringing the coffee shop to life by putting themselves into the shop. If you were to ever wonder who they are, 1
We had a great time. Absolutely different and fun. Lines were long....get there early or try to find a promoter. We got lucky...one of my friends knows a good promoter., 1
Beautiful display.  Even the bf loved it and didn't get bored which is a hard task for men looking at flowers lol.  Anyhow I'm definitely thinking of making the trip here again in winter to look at those displays.  They have great variety of plants., 1
So at the wee hours in the morning, 1
I had the Red Velvet Mocha it was a good Fix to my coffee addiction. I Love that they have a drive thru especially when I'm stopping by at 2am. They have a patio area with a few tables to enjoy the lovely weather while it lasts. I will defiantly be back :), 1
Always a good deal to be found + Nice store  This Saks Off 5th is my go-to for name-brand suits, 1
I've been coming to Table 34 on a semi/occasional basis for probably about 10 years now. My recent trip was fabulous as usual. Table 34 is the place we can always count on for well done cocktails and great food. Service has always been exceptional and price is fair for the quality of the meals. Can't recommend enough!, 1
Dr's Marsh and Jundt and their staff are the real deal. Super smart with kind and compassionate care. Reasonable prices too. I referred my boyfriend to them for his beloved kitten's spay. And I'm an employed CVT. Just sayin..., 1
This place gets a major thumbs up!!  I couldn't believe this was in the Bally's hotel. Came here for the Sunday Brunch, 1
A few weeks after my first visit, 1
What a fantastic gem in the most unlikely of places! Tea Time is run by Ken and Ritchie, 1
The best Pho soup I have tasted in Pittsburgh the soup is very savory, 1
Tuesday night party of four. Service was amazing and drinks were on point. Waiter knew every detail of the menu and we took his recommendations.  3/4 of us order the jerk pork. OMG it was the best jerk pork and polenta we've had. We were worried about having Jamaican food in Phoenix but this placed killed it.   Excited to go back and see what the weekend vibe is like at rum bar. Overall highly recommend for out of towners great atmosphere great location!, 1
I am from the east coast and visited Portrait Innovations in Maryland prior to this experience. I was extremely pleased with the photographer, 1
I love this place. I have a family of 6. My children and husband love the pizza here. We usually get a giant, 1
I do not live in Madison, 1
Had to attend a conference in Phoenix.  The hotels are very expensive there so I took a chance and stayed at Harras in maracopa$87  Only 20 mins to chandler. Nice hotel great pool and casino. The entertainment complex next door is truly impressive.  Watched the movie Fury there and had a beer in restaurant. They also have laser tag, 1
Best part of this place its in Melrose, 1
Quaint and homey looking restaurant.  I kind of felt like I was getting a weird look at time, 1
I saw Bonnie at DBTB several times before I left Madison.  For me, 1
I was skeptical to order at due to the other reviews. I was impressed with the delivery speed and accuracy. The driver was very friendly. The pizza was very hot and tasty. Overall, 1
The food was slightly bland, 1
a nice place to kick start your evening, 1
Best frozen yogurt in town.  This place is very clean and it doesn't get too busy.  They go beyond just serving yogurt as my son enjoys just hanging out here.  The visit is always a TREAT.  Thanks guys!, 1
This place is amazing! My dog isn't a fan of being groomed & because Mariana treats him like her own, 1
If you order a sundae, 1
This restaurant looks like it's been there forever, 1
A very nice, 1
Came here on our second to last day in Montreal, 1
I have seen many Cirque shows over the years so I know what to expect from them. This one was totally out of left field and is billed as the Sensual Side of Cirque du Soleil. Boy, 1
The BEST Pizza in Vegas period!!!   The rest of the menu is just as wonderful. The attention to detail is fanstatic., 1
We live close to Monsoon Thai and enjoy going there for dinner occasionally.  In the evening there is seldom a crowd, 1
Ok so I live right down the street and I would say I've been to a fair amount of bars and restaurants and clubs being 21 anyways I always would drive by this place and always wanted to give it a try I'm a sporty kind of girl so a co worked said augies was awesome so we went we had drinks till they closed I order a margarita it was awesome they add orange juice which is supper good and they were giving out prizes for doing shots I declined lol but I order the mozzeralla sticks they were bomb.com they were so good they were wrapped in a egg roll it was different but really good service and staff were awesome fast the bar was clean there were families singles couples and even some senior citizens so I loved it so much I took my husband we sat at the bar the bartender was on it the bar was full and we were never left with an empty glass we tipped her very good one of the best bartenders I have seen with awesome service I had an pizza husband had a burger which he loved since as a man that's all he eats the place was packed but there was room at the bar I felt super comfty everyone was happy and having a good time it was a Thursday evening they had an band who played Zach brown and country favorites and other bar favorites they were awesome wish we could o stayed longer ... Also if u really think ur gunna be able to go to any bar and watch a fight for free ur crazy these other negative reviews r one of many good reviews I have gone twice and have never had bad luck same with my friends I recommend this place way better then native new yorker!!!! Love love augies new place for drinks:), 1
I love this bar and am fortunate it's nearby my house. They have several tv's, 1
Incredibly tasty Chinese noodles and pancakes, 1
Random and strange, 1
Fist pump fist pump fist pump!!  Upon walking into this shrine of insanity one might wonder, 1
Jim the host is amazing. Such great customer service!  So friendly. A great addition to the delicious food., 1
I was referred to Chandler from a friend and hopped onto Groupon for a voucher for a massage.  I go and see a lot of different massage therapists.  I can easily say that Chandler is one of the best.  He had strong hands, 1
Thorough friendly and fast. What more could you want from your eye doc? Very impressed with their knowledge and speedy service. I will return to Dr Heffelfinger and Dr Maynard again., 1
One name: Falah who's the owner...great guy!! My first time here and he says "baklava is fresh...here try some" I ended up buying more and it's a good thing I did!!  Greek wraps on the west side are hard to beat...this place is a very very very close   Who makes pita from scratch? This guy does...great atmosphere. The panera of pitas I would say, 1
Bacon martini ....Nuff said! This is a dive bar... Its not for the fancy  stuck up type. They have live music sometimes.. Cool crowd lol Hopefully this place is still there. I went in 2009., 1
I found Impact Bootcamp throgh Groupon and am very happy I did.  I just signed up for additional classes which are very reasonably priced.  I really like the variety of exercises in the workout and am pleased at how fast the time goes.  The instructors make a point to learn people's names and provide personal encouragement throughout the classes.  If you're serious about getting in shape, 1
As over the top as Donald's combover.  I didn't know the Egyptians had casinos in their pyramids! Very much a theme place. Send the less casino-excited to this destination to at least experience the various theme-based activities. Ride down the Nile. Explore a tomb..., 1
A cool little place with freaking spectacular food.  The tom ka is excellent.  And ask for the avocado yellow curry (it might not be on the menu).  You will be delighted!, 1
The food was certainly good and so was the service. Unfortunately they informed us about a menu change by January 2015.   I had some chicken tenders that had a good amount of driest and sauce to them. Everything went well but it's sad to know they're changing their usual style., 1
Not to shabby.  Went on a Saturday night.  They had a half rack rib special with 2 sides for 12.99.  This was totally worth it.  I ate every bite.  Ribs fell off the bone.  The sauce is where it's at.  Nuff said., 1
That Dinner was "IMPOSSIBLE" to TOP last night at THE LUNCH & LEARN is just the VERY best that you can treat yourself too.  Chef Robert Irvine of Food Network's Dinner: Impossible & Restaurant Impossible Held a Magnificent informative (with recipes to take home of dishes) and entertaining 5 course dinner with wine pairing at this breathtaking resort. Some question and answering was done, 1
What hasn't already been said about this place? It is a MUST GO TO when I hit up Vegas! Always gets me started and you get refills for cheap! It even helps out when I have alcohol back in my room and want to make my own drink. My tummy might hurt a little bit but it's worth it. Make sure to get an extra shot too. I'll just be repeating what everyone else has said but I did notice that the Caeser's one is a one or two bucks more than the one between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. I'm going to Vegas tomorrow night and I am definitely hitting up Fat Tuesday!  PS I can't remember what two specifics I usually get but it looks like a huge big stick (the popsicle) and it is DELICIOUS! Just ask the bartender I'm sure they will know., 1
The ladies showed up with in the time frame. They asked what needed to be cleaned and did a great job.  In the end they asked for me to inspect everything and if it was to my liking. I would recommned this company again!, 1
I love this place. Only a few blocks from my shop and they are open early in the morning when I really need my coffee before opening the shop., 1
The food here is amazing.  They have vegan, 1
I've been eating at the Landmark for years, 1
WOW! That was some good authentic Mexican food. The staff was friendly and the food delicious. The serving sizes are filling and I LOVE to eat! Although I was full I wanted more... You guys got me hooked. So glad a friend recommended eating there.   This place is located inside the boulevard mall food court. DONT PASS THIS PLACE UP! I am salivating like crazy just writing this :-/, 1
Good place to grab a bite-- not your normal airport grub. Breakfast is Served all day.   I had the "smothered and covered"-- chuck steak with mushroom, 1
My first Michael Mina.  After learning that we would have to wait almost 2 hours for craftsteak, 1
Skip the slice and get the meals.   Last time we came here is was great. The meals were good, 1
I have been going to the Paisley Violin for years, 1
I went to this place to chill out with some friends and found a awesome to get a beer with friends.  I noticed that this place served food but I didn't try any while I was there.   It was nice to find a local place that offer locally made beers instead of the typical large company beers. It was also nice to see that the servers were knowledgable about their products.  During my visit I tried the local amber and was pleasantly surprised.  It was smooth and delicious. The second beer I tried was a crimson red.  It had the bitterness of a red without being too bitter.  I had the opportunity to sample the whiskey beer wine which was flavorful but not my cup of tea but it was worth the try.   It was a cool evening and we sat on the patio. The only downside was that there was not enough heaters to make it enjoyable.   Overall it was a good place to hang out with some friends., 1
I'm leaving Vegas a big fan of the burger bar.  I had the buffalo burger with a bunch of my own custom fixings with a nice tall glass of beer.  Oh and the beer....they have about a million different options from all over the world.  Meal for two people....2 burgers, 1
I had to call here again this week. I can not say how great Paul is. He comes on time, 1
I met my VIP Host for Marquee Nightclub here with a group of friends before going into the club over President's Day weekend. The vibe is very urban and looks straight out of a Hollywood movie so dress appropriately. I asked my waitress what she recommended off their specialty drinks menu and she recommended a Fist Pump. Simply the drinks a j\u00e4ger bomb with a shot of pop rocks. You take the shot of pop rocks and then the j\u00e4ger bomb and what follows is just amazing. The instant the j\u00e4ger bomb hits the pop rocks on your tongue the pop rocks explode really hard. It's like fireworks in your mouth or as someone put it to me later: what an orgasm would feel like if your tongue could have one., 1
We tried three rolls there.  The regular rolls are boring, 1
We like Zapatas very much. I've eaten there about 50 times. It is good Mexican food for a reasonable price. All of the food is good and Dinners come with soup. Lunch menu is available until 5pm and save you a couple bucks but without soup. Happy hour goes til 6pm, 1
I stayed here over Super Bowl weekend for Saturday and Sunday nights. This was my first time staying here. I originally booked 5 rooms for two adults in each, 1
The baby back rib kimchi stew I had yesterday was delicious!!!  OMG!!!  Back here for more!! Lol., 1
Best New York Style Pizza in Scottsdale. They have Slices & Square Lunch Specials during the week. Not sure about the weekend. You won't be disappointed., 1
I really didn't have any expectations for this place.  We chose it as it was one of the lower priced pre-fix dinners before our show that evening.  Well, 1
Visited twice on our 5 day trip to Edinburgh. Amazing attentive service, 1
Went here today after hearing it was great for kids and I can say I'm a new fan.  I usually prefer my bagels toasted, 1
I loved this place so much! I definitely think they're a top contender for plain-ole good Thai food in the city!   The place is very cute inside. It is comfortable, 1
Lo Cascio is a nice little Italian restaurant within walking distance of my home.  If it was not so close I probably would have never noticed it.  I go for the "Early Bird" dinners between 4-6 when you can get smaller portions for great prices.  Everything I have had so far has been good and the staff is very friendly., 1
Bought a daily deal coupon thing for this place and enjoyed my dinner very much.  Staff were friendly and accommodating and happy to accept my coupon deal and didn't treat me like a second class customer. Menu options were explained, 1
Just moved into a new neighborhood and used Yelp to find nearby restaurants. Ike's has 5 stars so I decided to try.  I ordered the bear claw which sofa king yummy. Yummy yummy yummy. Staff was friendly and place was clean. Stoked it's so close to me, 1
Awesome service.  Great food.  Had the 1 pounder  I'm a repeat offender.  Only because I had the 2 pounder twice and it hurt me., 1
They hosted my parents 30th anniversary surprise party this past weekend and the presentation of food was stunning! The service was marvelous!  The food tasted wonderful!  The party was amazing and the staff truly made the event perfect!, 1
Went here for lunch today..not bad. Like everyone else says its not super nice and a little slow. But the Chimichanga I had was good (nice and crispy but not dripping with grease) and it was cheap. We were able to go here for lunch and be back within an hour. I liked it and will be back!, 1
I love me some Elvis. In fact I'm a member of two of the Elvis fan clubs in town. Okay maybe I just shared too much. Anywho, 1
(Lyrics - Weezer - Say It Ain't So)  Bo Bites is coming Is gonna review Somebody's restaurant Is giving me thrills Guess I'll just give them a try  Oh yeah, 1
I am a fan of this city, 1
Great food! I was in Charlotte for a small day-conference and we dropped in. I ordered the shredded chicken taco salad as I usually do at mexican restaurants. I have no complaints about this place. If you're in town, 1
Yummy taco joint!  I stopped in here for a little happy hour action just last week... Their happy hour is a loooonng one, 1
Great value as affordable as it gets in Las Vegas.Rooms are good but a problem with plumbing in both rooms we stayed in.Restaurants were quite good.Pool and hot tub area outside is very nice with palm trees and lots of room to space yourself from others., 1
I have been coming to this store for a few years now, 1
I went here with a friend because of the hype and enjoyed the experience.  The server was very good, 1
Went there last night and it was so much fun! For a Friday night at 12am the bar gets very busy and somewhat loud. The bartenders were very fast at getting my drinks and the bartender "Brittany" was very nice and had a big smile the whole time. I normally don't like bars like this because it is Not my sene, 1
My husband & I spent the whole day with the guys at a Trip Ink. We are so happy with the service and work done my husband got his whole upper arm done by Derek and plans a return trip to put on the chest part of it. I got not 1 by 2 pieces done by Rob & am very happy with both. I look forward to going back & putting some more detail into them., 1
A jewel box of a restaurant! I heard good things about The Gladly, 1
Nice location on roosevelt row. Cool look inside, 1
Good quality Snow Crab Legs are hard to find outside of a Vegas buffet, 1
It's not by accident that the Sugar Bowl is one of the last original spots still standing in Old Town. Quality vs. Character? In the case of the Sugar Bowl Ice Cream Parlor, 1
Hey N LV yelpers! Thanks for the reviews... I had my yorkie puppy groomed here weeks ago and they did a fantastic job! I'll def bring her back here one more time soon before we move out of the area! -Miss Yelp 2011, 1
Went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. We've tried several other restaurants at the Cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. The experience started off not so great, 1
I gotta be honest, 1
This resort is just as nice as the Four Seasons.  I really like the service.  People are attentive and friendly.  It's a historic hotel, 1
This is not any old chocolate... It's Chocolate Heaven!! Believe me once you've checked out Hotel Chocolat once you will find plenty of reasons to return! Having first tasted their sumptious chocolate in Birmingham its great to see it open up in Edinburgh - though might not be good for the diet!  Whilst it's a little on the pricey side it's worth every penny! Only problem is there's too much to choose from.... The truffles are devine and soo many fantastic varietes..., 1
THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED  And it's a real shame. I would order from Pizza Amier at least once a month, 1
My favourite restaurant in Montreal. Incredible food and friendly, 1
The food is very good.  It's worth a trip just for the Hawaiian Martini.  :)   Nice ambiance and great service., 1
I give Ernesto's Service 5 stars because the review will not let me give 10; 18 years ago I moved to Las Vegas with my 1989 300 ZX, 1
This is a very beautiful hotel and they offer free valet parking.  It's always a pleasure to walk around the place and feel the ambiance.  There is a 24/7 Starbucks and bar.  Their Lion exhibit closes early though.  I would stay away from their buffet, 1
happiness: all you need is the 8 corner pizza with the turbo crust. there's almost always a coupon for it on their website, 1
THIS PLACE...... is awesome the waitress is very on top of her game. She works for her tips. I asked for her personal fav. which I had no idea what it would be but omg this was the best shrip quesadilla evaaaar omg so good! The shrimp is perfect I love this place... highly reccomend. VP, 1
i love there thin crust pizza however the service here isn't A1. i usually order mine to go, 1
Whew what a selection of what I call healthy hippy food haha ( not a bad thing ) .. a Great place to get rare items if your maybe on a diet, 1
In town for business and hotel was across the street, 1
I decided I wanted an industrial ear piercing and did tons of research. After some scary stories and one scary youtube video, 1
My wife and I had the family dinner. The sizzling rice soup alone was worth the trip. The PooPoo platter was just OK--nothing spectacular, 1
I love pho. I really do. I love all Asian noodle soups in general now that I think about it - udon, 1
The buffet selections are on par with the Wynn's in Las Vegas or any other casino resort. But what sets this spot apart is their customer service and attention to details. I felt really cater and attend to throughout my dinning experience. The staffs at the buffet seems like they got it down. Five stars for that. Definitely be back when I'm in town again., 1
Sitting outside on the patio was the best decision we made. They have a nice modern fireplace and heat lamps when it gets cold. It's fully walled off and intimate. They had a great live band too. The decor of the place is great, 1
We stayed here for a stay cation in june. We were not prepared to tip the staff, 1
This patisserie is located behind the beautiful Bellagio Botanic Garden. The first thing you'll see is the mesmerizing fountain of cascading liquid chocolate. JP offers an incredible selection of sweet and savory items including chocolates, 1
this is our favorite location...the theatres and facilities are always spotless.  the staff is always friendly and the seats comfortable., 1
Really great Thai food, 1
The best place to get out of a bind when you're on the road and want to eat healthy!  I eat here all the time and appreciate the fresh food.  I recently found out Chipotle is owned my McDonalds (I only heard but haven't verified) which I thought was interesting.  Nonetheless, 1
Deep Sea is easily my favorite spot for lunch in the area. There is a different menu daily, 1
This place is a cute little boutique store with pleasant owners!  They have clothes, 1
I came here around 6pm on a Wednesday.  The place was almost empty which was perfect.  My friend and I didn't have to wait to be seated or anything and service was prompt.  I started off with the soft pretzels and fondue. That coupled with an IPA that they had on tap (sorry I forgot the name of it) was PERFECT!  Then I had the Fried chicken that came with mashed potatoes, 1
Apr\u00e9s l'article vu sur le blog d'une amie, 1
As far as Chinese food goes, 1
There's a reason why this place has a reputation for being the hottest club in Vegas. Best talent, 1
I can't really comment on how this location was before the remodel but I can compare it to the 200+ DDs I've been in during my life...and for one outside of the Northeast it does a pretty good job. And god knows its better than Starbucks.   I've never experienced an extended wait or a line and I've always had my order delivered to me in a timely fashion. The don't toast the English muffin on the breakfast sandwich automatically, 1
Had a great breakfast, 1
My favorite stadium so far, 1
I bought a radiator for my sisters car here last week and couldn't believe how cheap the price was. Her car is now running like a champ. The parking lot can be tricky but when your saving lot of dough you look deal with it., 1
Awesome and fast! Lunch was outstanding, 1
I went here after school because I wanted something cold and it's really good for the price. They pack the ice then syrup then ice the syrup and that's why it gets a bit slow sometimes but it's good. I really liked it! It might be a regular stop for me ^^, 1
I have been here many times but recently decided to try the eggs benedict. They are not my favorite. The Howie burger is perhaps one of my favorites! Their fries are well seasoned leaving ketchup as only an option. I have enjoyed the nachos and other items on the menu. I even like the key lime pie although I am generally not a fan. The red velvet cake is the best of any place ever! My fiance ordered this for my birthday a couple of years ago and it was decorated with fresh blueberries and strawberries. Perfection!, 1
A+. My friend and I are natives and have been searching for the places where all of the real Las Vegans hang out, 1
We're from the other side of town, 1
Loved the food, 1
One day several months ago I was trying to find a good taco shop close to work. With the courtesy of Yelp, 1
I'm not Polish. But if I was and living in Edinburgh, 1
I absolutely loved the show. It was entertaining in every aspect. I love that the show as a whole is very well thought out - from the pre-show entertainment all the way to the final piece.   I was slightly worried that it would be purely dance routines, 1
After reading YELP reviews, 1
Love the "Jambalaya" in this place! Usually come in here for dinner before catching a movie. However, 1
Wonderful food.  Great service.  A must eat of the west valley!, 1
My favorite pasta is Zany Ziti. The desert pizookie is also really good. They've never let me down. One of the best local places., 1
My friend treated me to dinner here for my birthday, 1
This location is still open and still a great place to go and watch the game or have a going away party-, 1
Great food and service! Went there for the first time for dinner last week.  Once we ordered we started to notice that the place got kinda busy.  I remember thinking that this place must be pretty good. Sure enough it was!  I ordered the Flauntas combo and my mom ordered chicken fajitas.  I tried her fajitas too of course.  Everything tasted fresh and flavor was amazing.  They brought us free chips and salsa too while we waited., 1
I would recommend these guys and will keep their number. Kelly was great! He did excellent work. I did check out Home Depot pricing and never did get a quote or call back or a price for the installation.  I asked Kelly if he owned the company he said he had been with them 20 years. Great service thank you Kelly., 1
I USED TO miss the convenience of living by the ocean and getting a fresh, 1
Ok... Read all the reviews & still decided to eat here. Glad I did. Don't drink the water, 1
I have always had a great experience every time I have seen a show. Amphitheaters are not normally my thing but this place does its job. I always prefer indoor concerts 9 time out of 10 but sometimes I can't help it if a band is coming that I want to see. This place has always been clean and spacious. I like the convenient location and parking.  I have seen 311, 1
I totally love this location of Carl's Jr.  The food is great, 1
Brunch here was one of the most amazing meals of my life! It was SO incredible!   Our waiter was the sweetest guy and I loved starting the meal with a bloody mary prepared for me table side :) The waiter used all of the perfect ingredients and even muddled the garlic in the bottom of the glass! I ended up adding a little bit of A1 to make this the best bloody mary ever.   For food, 1
2nd time i ate here. made reservations for sun evening. table was ready upon arrival. 1st time a friend took me here to try it out. it's a typical brazilian bbq meat place. all sorts of meat cuts. bonus is to try all the different meats offered and then have additional servings of your fav(s). the down-size is beverages and desserts are not included. dinner price per person is around $48. if you're creative, 1
The chicken is wonderful. You get quick service with a smile. Sometimes it can be over cooked but just take it back and they will recook u some chicken. The chicken and dirty rice is what I love most. Keep in mind you cant have a large family here the lobby is quite small. Only three tables inside and about 4 chairs. Their are like 2 tables outside so I would  do takeout only when trying to feed 8 to 12 people., 1
I have used this business for all my families vehicles since they first opened with great results. I took my new ford into the dealership where I purchased it for recall repairs. While it was there the dealer mechanics discovered an oil leak and wanted to charge me $900.00 to repair it as my warranty had just expired. I took the car to Gerard at American for a second opinion. He could not find any oil leak. Like I said, 1
Excellent burgers and excellent servers, 1
My best friend felt like sushi so I recommended this place.  I had been here before and enjoyed it.  It was getting late also so this was the only place I could think of.  It was not very busy and sat at the bar.  We ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll which is the best ever.  There were also some people doing sake bombs so we decided we should try it too.:-)  We also had a tsunami punch which is yummy and strong.  They have a DJ in there so it makes it fun if you are in the mood to get your party started.  They also gave us the happy hour prices although we were a little early!, 1
I enjoy drinking real ale in the UK, 1
Going to eat steak at this hidden gem (really) in one of the last of the dingy casinos on the Las Vegas strip was one of the high lights of our recent trip! I told my hubby let's go see if this steakhouse is as really good as the reviews said and he asked me, 1
I was really surprised by the hair cut I got here.   The salon was really clean, 1
JoJo's made me love jerky. Seriously... I hated jerky but was urged to try theirs and I'm SUCH a fan now. It's a must try. JoJo's is the reason there's a very fine line between "I'll just have one piece of jerky" and "I'm all out of jerky." 'Nuff said., 1
Indian food is often minimized by attempts to make it less exact and somehow more palatable by other cultures.  This is at the cost often of not allowing the original beauty of the cuisine to be savoured by all. In fact, 1
Stopped by here after leaving the airport on a long flight from Atlanta.  Wanted something quick and found this place hide high reviews in our area.    We ordered 3 chicken fingers plates with drinks...came out to about $31.  Owner was very cool and asked us how we found the place, 1
Nice job! These folks did themselves proud. I visited 3 parks during a two day trip to Spring Training and this was by far the best.  Great design and layout. Good food choices, 1
We went here to try out the 50$ free slot play. You have to hit a jackpot to collect any money. You can't cash it out. It went pretty fast :-). I gambled there for a little while afterward and had a good time. Cheap beer is a plus.  I love that they have a Subway and a Nathan's hot dogs inside the casino. You won't find 5$ footlongs in Vegas. More like 10$ footlongs :-). However, 1
This review is specifically for the Sports Bar at the Mirage, 1
We love this place.  It is a great neighborhood spot.  We always get take out because of our little one, 1
Okay I know they are called the Original Pancake House but they have by far the best french toast of any eating establishment I have ever visited.  But you gotta order the challah french toast, 1
One of the best places in Surprise to watch the sun set :)  No matter the time of year, 1
My family and I have strong ties to Pittsburgh despite living in the Akron, 1
I live nearby and had always meant to check it out. Now that I finally got in there I will definitely be a repeat. The staff is fantastic, 1
I love the patio and the ambiance, 1
I have never been to this store....I've never even been to the state. But I heard about it from a friend as a great place to get custom stone jewelery. I had been looking for a pair of teardrop shaped blue lace agate plugs (for my stretched ear piercings) to wear at our wedding last year. I had looked all over the internet and couldn't find what I wanted.   I contacted them by email to explain what I had been looking for. They had never made teardrop shaped plugs but were all about figuring it out and making them! I sent them a description with dimensions, 1
Best horchata ever.  (The food is great too, 1
Regardless of where you are on Saturday, 1
If you're ballin on a budget, 1
I love this place because I can be in and out in 10-15 minutes.  Everyone there has a smile on their face.  I really love the convinience factor of Sams Club., 1
We had quite a lovely meal at Shibuya last weekend, 1
I don't go often, 1
My wife and her friends have raved about Postino and I finally had my chance to take in Postino a few days ago.   The bruschetta is excellent. I had a hard time determining which was my favorite, 1
Spacious with an extensive range from plant labels to chainsaws, 1
I stayed here for the MLK weekend. The Imperial had the best rate for the location. The crowd here is very young. Yes...this place is one of the older casino/hotels but it's still in the heart of it all. The Imperial has an edgy feel to it though. I love the dealertainers! You can play the tables with celebrity impersonators. Not that I have partaken in that since I'm a video poker whore......But it's always nice to walk by something that puts a smile to your face. :) There is also some lip-syncing acts on the casino floor with some of them that's pretty entertaining as well and....... its free. Love free entertainment!  This place is easily 4 stars for me because of the price, 1
Went back the next day with my son and mom and the fries were still specatular.  This time I had a stromboli and it was pretty good., 1
Another outstanding triumph for Mr. Fox, 1
Great place on the water. Beautiful views. Good fish fry. Very reasonable prices with nice selection of fish and sides. The staff are great!, 1
Candice was an excellent waitress and a real pleasure. Had the chicken mole verde which was great. We had six in our party and no one left hungry., 1
I recently stayed at South Point and it was awesome! They gave us a 2 for 1 coupon for the lunch buffet and the service was awesome. The food was so so, 1
Went on a whim based on a friend's recommendation.  This is not "tex mex" but upscale food with Mexican or New Mexican influence.  Prickly pear margarita was excellent, 1

Get the Kobe Beef Burger Zin style. The truffle aioli fries. The Kit-Kat shake. This place is not cheap. But for what you get it is the best of the best. Every time we go here, 1
At first I was a bit confused by their requests for no cell phones or laptops.  But after dining here three times, 1
What can I say about The Old Fashioned that hasn't been said in the 571 other reviews?  Probably nothing.  But here are my thoughts...  The Old Fashioned opened in Madison a couple of years after I graduated from UW Madison and left for Chicago.  I'm pretty much bummed that I missed nine years of eating here.  I mean come ON.  52 Wisconsin beers on tap???  A new beer every week of the year!  (Maybe I should plan on this.)  Apple Pie made by a local FFA? Locally made items up and down the menu?  This place is awesome.  The cheese curds - pretty damn good. (Am I allowed to say "damn" on Yelp?)  Great flavor, 1
This place was exactly what we were looking for!  We were with friends and wanted to grab a bottle of wine and a small bit of pizza.  We had already had so much to eat (and drink).  We shared two pizzas and a bottle of chianti.  Along with the bread and olive oil/tapenade it was just the right amount of food.  The margherita pizza was simply perfect., 1
I was craving hummus and my friend almost ripped my head off when I suggested Pita Jungle ...so there we were ..at Pars on a weekday night. We were both Pars virgins but the reviews had been good so we tried.  He ordered the Chef's special --ground beef, 1
Fantastic!!!!!  Grilled chicken pitta and gyro picante ordered with salads absolutely great loads of flavor great portion size and great value. Defiantly become a regular haunt. Staff were so helpful and happy great to chat with while waiting for the awesome food, 1
Delicious food but very expensive .  It's a nice place to eat if you want to treat yourself to a upscale lunch while doing some shopping in fashion show mall., 1
- Excellent staff - Excellent service - Excellent patient care - Excellent technology - Excellent EXPERIENCE!  No doubt about it, 1
I was all excited to go to this place and then read some mixed yelp reviews, 1
I can't believe the number of idiotic reviews on here from people who don't eat or like seafood or who complain about the price of a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. I'm a foodie with money. I eat out 4 plus nights a week. Been to every single restaurant in Vegas multiple times. Bartolotta is a world class experience. Sit outside. $150 a head minimum. Worth every penny. Get the Top Chef menu. Throw in a couple of extra for the table to share like the rabbit in pancetta, 1
Great bent box style. The filet mignon is my favorite, 1
I went with two other adults and no kids in our group. We all really enjoyed the different segments and the way the animals/ birds were not all enclosed/ secluded like in most zoos. Some of the animals in here were one that I had not seen before and it was a fun experience.  This is a clever use for a building built for the Olympics.  If you also plan to go to botanical gardens it would be beneficial to get the ticket bundle for additional savings., 1
David Fox and his team have put together a professional, 1
Love this place for a consistent, 1
I went to Bachi Burger because my co-workers were giving me a going away luncheon there. Service wasn't bad because we got there right when it opened. It started to get  busy after we left, 1
Dang you, 1
This place definitely rates 4 or 5 for design and ambiance.  The ocean inspired deep blue motif is calming and assuring.  This review is actually just for the bar which I visited twice on last weeks trip, 1
Where else can you get a Chile Relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito? Super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite.. Oh the overkill and love every second of it!! Jen Red Pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice.. this is some serious hybrid comfort food.. may sound strange but works very well! You'll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $10!, 1
My favorite yogurt joint in all of Phoenix!  I like it better than the other competitors because:  - Its CHEAP - Super friendly staff - Froyo flavors change regularly - its fun to try new ones! - Half off on Wednesdays if you wear your jammies! Double awesome!  - Interesting toppings - lemon syrup, 1
Coming from San Francisco where there is many top notch Indian restaurants this place definitely meets those standards.   They have a really nice lunch buffet from 11:30-3pm. Great naan and excellent service.  Definitely the place when I'm in town! Great work., 1
This may have been the best hotel I walked through while in Vegas. The structure was gorgeous, 1
It was my second visit at kyara. Honestly, 1
Alex provided stellar customer service in addition to making a fantastic Bloody Mary.  The ambience is just what I look for in a drinking establishment.  Also they have coors original on draft, 1
I always come here for an oil change, 1
Fantastic haunted house!!! we got a groupon for less than half price for VIP and didn't have to wait in line at all. this place must be better than decent or else there wouldn't be literally hundreds of people lined up outside.   i've been to many, 1
This is an excellent restaurant!  I bought a living social deal, 1
I've wanted to visit the Grand Canyon for a really really long time, 1
Don't be fooled by the Circus Circus Hotel. This restaurant is delicious and has a cool vibe., 1
I have always been a fan of RT. Their salad bar is always fresh and offers a good variety. On my most recent visit, 1
If you're looking to add a flare of whimsical personality to your wedding, 1
Oh my gosh! This place is amazingly beautiful! There is a great picture opportunity by the front entrance. They have amazing trees and flowers and waterfalls and plants. The hotel is very, 1
I'm a fan of Sam's Club and this was the first time I've been to this one.  I stopped in to pick up some vitamins and supplements.  It is a very clean location and a customer with 1000 items was kind enough to let me go ahead of her since I only had 4 items I was carrying in my hands.....you don't see kindness like that too often anymore.  Will I return?  Only if I'm in the neighborhood, 1
I'm honestly shocked by the poor reviews on this page. I have been an MEB resident for 7 months and had nothing but positive, 1
Excellent service.  I called on a Sunday when my fridge stopped working.  He came our Monday morning and fixed the problem.  Vladimir was helpful, 1
Their garden bisque is to die for!!!! Also the rocky road brownie!!! Fast service, 1
My sister and I had the pleasure of staying at this surprisingly quiet and classy hotel!  The staff was very helpful and polite, 1
**Grill side** Island sushi & grill has to be my favorite place for Hawaiian local food. Anytime you walk into a hawaiian local spot you will always feel the warmth and aloha. They are so welcoming it feels like i'm home! Garlic chicken is so awesome. I always get the bento with the teriyaki beef and choice of chicken which would always be the garlic chicken. I share with my son all the time and he absolutely loves it. He never leaves me any noodles though :(  Now that they have poke express, 1
The month before last was Bradley Ogden's last at Caesars. Todd Williams has enamored me with his food for the better half of the last decade from my frequent trips to Vegas and for all of the culinary standouts along the strip, 1
I love this bar.  The waitstaff is friendly and helpful.  There have been times when I have been personally thanked by the management.  This bar is frequented by servers from the surrounding restaurants after they get off work.  That tells me that this bar is good to their customers.  Servers and restaurant staff like to support their industry, 1
Items Experienced: Crab meat and sweet corn supreme soup Peking duck with Tsar Nicoulai reserve caviar, 1
Stopped in for a quick dessert on the drive back from Jerome.  Grabbed a slice of Jack Daniels Pecan Pie with a scoop of Butter Pecan ice cream.  Took one bite, 1
I've been to this specific Hobby Lobby twice now. I like that it's next to a JoAnne's, 1
We have been coming here for the past 6 yrs. and have never been disappointed. I love everything about this restaurant. Made reservations for a special event, 1
Quaint little coffeehouse with a picturesque view of the lake in the Sprouts shopping plaza. There is plenty of outdoor and indoor seating here. They offer a plethora of drink options, 1
The best steakhouse in Las Vegas!  Ron the manager is beyond exceptional and his entire staff deserves a 5 star rating!  The prime rib is the best hands down.  I also love the fact they bring out bacon, 1
Update - this was the fourth or fifth visit to C's over the past few years; my coworkers have a breakfast club where we frequent various places once a month or so.  The breakfast grub is straight-forward, 1
We, 1
Holy Moly. Sonics drinks and ice will bring a dead person back from the grave. You can get any concoction you can possibly think of and the ice is perfect for crunching. Their tots with cheese are ridiculously good too. The rest of their food can kind of be blah but I love every version of their tots you can get. They had a sparkling strawberry lemonade that isnt on the menu anymore but I would hit my mama for it! It was amazing!, 1
Great food and ambiance.  We moved into the area and like to have a regular Italian place with a nice bar.   Food was great, 1
There isn't any other place I think I could eat an entire order of hummus by myself.... This is the Real deal. Yeah it's in a crappy neighborhood, 1
These guys helped my brother out with supplements when he came in, 1
Tried to go here on a weekend one time but skipped it due to the hour plus wait. A coworker and I went midweek and got in quickly.  We started with the onion rings which were quite good. Nice batter, 1
I haven't always had stellar experiences here, 1
Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!, 1
My husband and I made a super last minute decision to try Firefly after every other dinner option we'd considered failed. I mean, 1
Well it's taken nearly a week, 1
Great restarant and service.  Went there for Valentine's Day with my wife.  We had great service by our server (Tom) and other waitstaff.  They have a nice beer and wine menu that we enjoyed.  My wife and I had the Cioppino and Scallops with risotto that were both prepared expertly., 1
I definitely enjoyed a couple of hours at SideBar. I have been tired of the same places I always go, 1
Check in on Yelp and get 20% of services., 1
Purple cauliflower in the gnocchi was cool :) The bar in the front is cool, 1
Besides the odd smell that I encountered when I first walked in, 1
You must try this place. Compared to Pho 87, 1
Great place to watch football or other sports, 1
Excellent drinks and service. Some of the drinks (iced teas) are over priced. The only drawback is that they're not open during daylight morning hours., 1
The music is good, 1
-Goodlooking people everywhere, 1
The space is small but the crepes and lattes are dope. Super busy on the weekends so of you can hit up Bradburys during the week, 1
Still really enjoy this place but the service is always questionable in the dining room.  The server took our drink order came back pretty fast and took our food order.  Once the food came she was around for a little bit and then disappeared into the kitchen.    Overall the food was prepared to order and it was awesome as always.  We will continue to come here., 1
Pretty good BBQ but the one thing you must get no matter what if you come here is the bacon board. The has at least 6 different types of bacon you can sample and every one of them is delicious. I wouldn't make the trip for the BBQ but just might for that bacon board again. Service was better than average., 1
I remember my fiancee told me at the time that she stayed at the Tropicana a few years ago and remembered the tropical bed sheets. A coworker told me that she stayed there a few years ago and it was "ghetto".  Well for my bachelor party we stayed there through a deal we got online. So it wasn't expensive at all. The remodeled the place a few years ago and its really nice. It's got that Miami feel to it. The rooms were clean and the hotel itself was pretty posh in my opinion. The hotel gave us adjoining rooms, 1
It's confirmed. Poke Express is the real deal and worthy of an upgrade to five stars.  After finally trying Hawaiian Style Poke a couple of weeks ago and then going back to Poke Express today, 1
When I walked into to Soul Gastrolounge, 1
3 of us went to Joe's today for a late lunch (3pm). We sat in the lounge area instead of the outside patio area. Our server's name was Hope and she was great.  We started with a crab cake appetizer which was full of crab meat delicately seasoned. 2 of us ordered the Joe's lunch special for $24.95 which included a 6oz filet, 1
This hookah lounge is just that, 1
First time here and I thought it was so adorable and charming.  I got the j\u00e4ger schnitzel and it was quite delicious!  The apple strudel was delicious as well.  Sweet but not overly so.  I would most definitely go back., 1
This literally one of the best vape shops ever! !! I come here quite a bit. I normally don't even do house juices but this is the only place I'll every get house juices. ... You must check them out ASAP, 1
My family sees Dr TJ & Dr Goldman both of which are great & thorough!    However, 1
Your typical brew pub with a respectable beer selection and a solid pub food menu (burgers, 1
Biggest portions ever!!! Very reasonable pricing and husband loves this place. Lines can be very long sometimes but it's worth the wait. The banana nut muffin is really good and the potatoes are really sprinkled with crack. No lie. Haha., 1
Went here for my birthday dinner and was floored by every dish.   One of the starters was the beef tartare with crushed caper aioli, 1
Another great experience at Brixx!  Dropped in here for dinner last night and for the first time I actually tried their wood fired chicken salad.  It was perfect! Balsamic dressing, 1
Obsessed.  Ambiance is great, 1
Excellent food and Justin was an amazing server. I had the tempura shrimp appetizer and it was the best tempura I've ever had. Also tried the filet mignon salad and Saigon fried rice.....Both were good. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff., 1
This is one of my favorite places to waste time and daydream about my future perfect chef's kitchen!  Also, 1
Atmosphere was great. I love byob! The girls at the table ordered the filet minion and it was decent, 1
This place made me feel like the ultimate bargain shopper. I love shopping in Arizona this time of year because they have major clearances. I was able to get a pair of black jeans and a dress on sale for a total of $8.75 including taxes. That's like 4 dollars an item! How does this even happen???  The only reason I am not giving it a 5th star is ...........I couldn't find anything else I wanted to buy! I also got stuck in line behind a woman who kept separating her clearance purchases into many separate transactions, 1
This is a chic place to grab dinner on the strip. Fun for ladies because of the free cocktails. I would plan on going somewhere else though if you're looking for a good place to go dancing. Although they place music, 1
Ive been to hair color Xperts after a recommendation from my co-workers. I didn't end up with the same person they see as he was really busy and booked months in advance (eye roll) -so  I saw Julie. I definitely didn't mind getting her though because she has done an excellent job- my hair looks and feels fabulous when I get done and I would give the actual quality of the hair cut/color 5 stars all around (and trust me I am a PICKY customer in terms of hair cut and color)  The salon itself is very clean (unlike my first salon experience in Charlotte) and they also offer you a complimentary beverage, 1
The coffee is great. Waitress is really nice. A LOT of choices. Vegetarian friendly. They are willing to sub meat for potatoes. The hash browns are really good., 1
I'm very pleased with my gel manicure I received today at Allure. I was greeted by the lovely staff upon entering . My nail technician, 1
Everything here is awesome and the pecan salsa is amazing., 1
I've been coming to this park for some early evening runs as the weather begins to cool down.  There are enough hills to add a bit of a challenge, 1
Ready nice buffet. Everything was fresh abd looked good too.  Pineapple curry tilapia, 1
Pricey ($16-$25) but very tasty/strong cocktail (so-so margarita). Absolutely beautiful set up on patio (trees around the water reflects in diff moving color, 1
I have been here twice for two different reasons and both expreiences got 5 starts.  Last Spring I sold about $400 in gold scrap and feel that I got a good price and good service.    Last month I went to get my wedding band fixed.  I got my finger slammed in a car door (thanks Jen!) and the ring got most of the damage.  A prong was bent and I had a smaller diamond missing from the band.    They matched and fixed everything and polished it to an amazing shine.  This place may not have the fancyness of mall or big box jewelry stores but the service you get is great and the prices are reasonable.    Enjoy!, 1
Great hotel and buffet. Perfect place for locals or people who want to vacation in Vegas on a budget but don't want to stay in flea box., 1
I've been in Vegas for 7 years and finally found a great barber shop.  Charlene does a great job every time., 1
Wow my family came once and so we came here for my bday today. They got us in as a party of 10 right away and were very accommodating!  The server was AMAZING and interacted well with everyone including children... Honestly it was very impressive.  They gave me an awesome flan for my bday dessert and sang for me:) The manager came over and everyone was very pleasant. Now, 1
Can't go wrong with any of the donuts. I loved the glazed twists!!!, 1
A better than average family Italian with good food, 1
The last time I came to Vegas this place was still being remodeled and a few months from opening. So during our recent vacation trip to Utah over the 4th of July weekend, 1
Wow! Found my new favorite Indian joint! The food here is amazing. I had dinner and ordered the Korma Chicken and lets just say I'm hooked. The flavor and texture of the dish was something I've never had before and I've been eating Indian food for a while. The atmosphere is great & open. Nice well stocked bar & Bollywood playing on several flat screens. I believe the  owner is the bartender & a Russell Peters look-a-like. LOL The night I came there was a bus load of Indian tourists but the restaurant was well planned in advance. Prior to their arrival I would say there was a fairly large amount of Indian locals so you know the food is good. The free mango lassi was a great compliment to our meal. Garry our server is awesome and attentive. He's been there for 7 years so be sure to ask for him to get the best service. All in all this place gets 5 stars and despite the area it was still a safe place to park and not worry about the surrounding area., 1
Went there today to get help with ordering unique, 1
Each Chinese fast food place is different and each has their own speciality. This place's speciality is their wings and their crab ragoon! We love it and order often. The owners are really nice, 1
Harrah's is still a great deal (read: they give AWESOME comps), 1
It looks like a hole in the wall, 1
i like that it wasn't overly crowded and the music was great! maybe i liked the people there because we knew most of them? or maybe the vibe was just different. i like the fact that i can chill and then get up and dance and have room to move around. the drinks were kinda strong but that's a good thing!, 1
I don't eat any other burgers except In-N-Out and 5 Guys...and honestly, 1
This place can be fun for everyone.  I love the trampoline dodgeball events that they have.  The aerobics classes are much more exhausting than you would ever think.  Its a great way to change up your exercise program.  Check out the dodgeball events, 1
Sehr gutes Essen, 1
I would sign up to be the spokesperson for this business if there was not a line of Yelpers who are already doing so. I have few places that I go to for my light frozen treat. Besides one frozen yogurt shop and Frost Bites, 1
This wasn't a great meal, 1
We ate here last night (Wednesday night) and I will confirm that it was a win. Unsure of what to get on the menu we got the chef's tasting option. The tasting option was a great deal - $65. We got to taste 5 different things on the menu, 1
I love Light! We arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday with both girls and guys in our group for the guest list. You need to have a 1:1 ratio for the guys to get comp'd. Any extra guys have to pay. I recommend that guys buy their tickets ahead of time online. The night we went, 1
Excellent milkshakes and quirky location. Service was pretty fast and the burgers and fries looked good (although I didn't try them)., 1
the best colombian place i try so far in charlotte coming from someone that lived in new jersey. This place is better for bakery food and fast food, 1
I had a lunch date here in January.  Anna said Ethiopian was her favorite food.  So, 1
Yard House just got even better....They finally divided their incredible beer list into categories making it much easier to choose based upon each person's likes. I never knew they had ciders on the menu based on the names, 1
Friendly staff. Clean rooms. I'd stay again. Much better than sleeping on a dorm room floor., 1
I love the work they do and they're cheap!!!! So worth the trip!, 1
Stopped in last night for a slice of their red velvet.. they make some of the best red velvet Ive tried, 1
Pulled pork sandwich = 2stars (meat cold, 1
Go To Jenny!!!!! She is so beyond amazing!!! She did a perfect job!  I cannot express how happy I was and how in love I am with my dress after Jenny saved the day! My dress needed some serious changes (came in completely wrong after buying it from a bridal show) and Jenny turned it into a beyond perfect dress. I was so happy, 1
What makes Ranch Market so great is that it creates a fantastic experience for its customers. When you enter through the sliding doors for the first or thousandth time, 1
The cinnamon roll was delicious. The white mocha is my favorite. Their homemade whipped cream can be added to any drink and I recommend it. The food menu items change on a daily basis. Wonderful place in downtown. Many options to eat and drink. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Great place to get work done or just hang out. Highly recommended!, 1
My daughter has taken lesson here for 2 years.  Miss Nancy is wonderful and caring, 1
Bluewater Grill:  The successor of The Fish Market!  I had the pleasure of dining here with some of the ladies on the second day of their grand opening!  While the prices and portions are about the same as the Fish Market, 1
Whenever I come to Vegas, 1
Located in the new Linq, 1
I love the bowls and juices ... Although I've found it varies on the quality ( how much fruit/granola) is in the bowl based off of who is working ... For the price it always needs to be overflowing! It is some amazing stuff though !, 1
This place was cool.  We were in tao and kept wondering where the stairs went and why people were dressed in cheesy hula costumes, 1
Since, 1
My daughter's school recently had a fundraiser here.  For the amount of people they had and the line nearly out the door, 1
I have been meaning to do this review for a while, 1
This is the best sushi and Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, 1
Oh man... We sure do love this place! They have great food and also a great environment! Their steaks are delicious. I don't know what seasoning they put on there, 1
I really like the fact that you can get a variety of Hawaiian products here.  Being that I've never had the opportunity to go to Hawaii, 1
I came on Easter Sunday, 1
7 dollars for a Carmel latte AND Americano! Very impressed with how they make the coffee the price! Also, 1
Caribou Coffee on the U Pitt campus is fantastic! Good coffee, 1
We've ordered from king wongs twice now and we Love this place! The last time we ordered at 920 and they close at 930 and were happy to still deliver. We've had the general tso's, 1
I hired Gabe based on his reviews from Yelp.  He lived up to his great reviews.  He was courteous, 1
Little Crown & Anchor is a tiny bar with a lot of character. It is especially a win if you're a soccer nut. That's not my thing, 1
Lucky enough to be in Vegas during Restaurant Week because otherwise I wouldn't have thought twice about eating here on my own wallet! The deal was fantastic, 1
Leah did a great job. She took time to figure out what I was looking for and also gave me tips on how to take care of my fair in this dry heat since I just moved here., 1
Asian buffets are a guilty pleasure of mine. Cheap, 1
Awesome place!  Do not leave without trying their house drink, 1
I have lived in Las Vegas just over a year now. I pass by this place weekly and have wanted to stop in for some time. My partner and I have dined at many of the Roy's locations in Hawaii as well. I tend to be very critical of food & service when dining out. I like my restaurant experience to appeal to all my senses. Tonight we took out some friends of ours for a nice dinner and decided in Roy's. I honestly would have to say that from out first interaction with the hostess untill the point when we left the restaurant it had to have been THE ABSOLUTE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE WEVE HAD IN LAS VEGAS EVER. Our server was beyond attentive, 1
Very efficient airport.  Flying from SD, 1
I can remember riding along with my grandma to go order a pie from Red Devil's takeout window.  Seeing the guys hand-toss the pizza dough in the air was always mesmerizing to me as a kid.    Their pizza crust has not changed, 1
I really like the Katsu Chicken, 1
I can't say enough about this office! I just finished a great deal of dental care and Invisalign which went great. My little girls and I actually looked forward two going every couple weeks for my Invisalign...amazing staff, 1
This place is utterly adorable. It oozes a vibe that is warm yet modern, 1
We went back here the other weekend, 1
Somehow I did not realize that the little cafe in the Galleria office building had a listing on Yelp; so even though I have been eating here consistently for the last 3 years, 1
Really nice bright and friendly breakfast/lunch emporium, 1
My lab loves interacting with the other dogs.  Most dog owners I have seen there do pick up after their dog and are pretty friendly for a conversation while the 4 legged ones are playing around.  The bathrooms are now working and there is also a kids splash area and a dog splash area behind the restrooms., 1
AmaZing flavorful food in a colorful atmosphere. Will definitely come again and again., 1
I love the story time program here! I started coming this summer after having a baby and wanting to get my toddler out of the house while beating the heat. The staff here is amazing! It is a 30 minute session of singing, 1
A great find in Phoenix for fresh, 1
Jeremy did great on the following:  1. Offer reasonable prices and did not try to rip me off 2. Is responsive to my requests 3. Got the job done.   I felt comfortable with his service and he's honest., 1
Flavor yo.  This place actually uses fresh herbs and spices and food tastes like it.  Most places food is bland.  This place you taste the garlic you tast the pepper.  I honestly think the best thing they do/have is the bread and olive oil wtih herbs and seasonings they bring out.  Serious stuff.  Lasagna is pretty good too.  Here is a tip.  Do not order brushetta.  way overpriced, 1
I lived in New York City from 1998 through 2007 so I've been exposed to excellent pizza. Pizza and bagels are two of the foods I have missed most since moving to Charlotte. They just don't make them down here like they do up there. Recently I went to True Crafted Pizza for the first time after reading an article about it in the Observer. I had low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised.   I ordered the grilled margarita pizza with caramelized onions. The crust was perfectly done: thin, 1
We just missed breakfast and I was a little bummed because I wanted to try the pastrami salmon. But I am so happy we decided to stay for lunch. I had the cuban and my girlfriend had the roast beef sandwich. Both were excellent (ask for a side of horseradish sauce for the roast beef). Coffee was great and was served in a huge mug. We has a hard time deciding on a side because they all looked so good. The sweet potato and black bean salad was excellent. I couldn't believe how reasonably priced everything was for being made in-house and organic. Great healthy spot that won't hurt your wallet.   That being said, 1
This is the premiere beer bar in Las Vegas!  Aces and Ales is located on the East Side of Las Vegas near Sam's Town. If you are not a local, 1
I thought this place had a "clean" sort of a WOW factor.   4.5 stars. I am a girl who loves her red meat on occasion and the choices here, 1
I'm definitely torn between a Fan rating and a rating of as good as it gets...and here's a few reasons why  First and for most, 1
Cory was extremely prompt, 1
This is my favorite Mexican food place in the area, 1
Think Chocolate, 1
All I have to say is the store director Michael knows how to make sure any mistakes are resolved and taken care of. Michael went out of his way to make sure our daughter received the correct cake and even had his team go out of their way to deliver it. Highly recommended place to order cakes for birthday parties., 1
I am Italian and I am a pizza snob. I was born and raised in Wisconsin where a lot of italian places take great pride in the pizza making process, 1
Having chomped down on various shish, 1
I've been wanting to go here for a few weeks and I was pretty happy when I left.  My boyfriend and I shared the tres banditos and some deviled eggs.  Our favorite was the pulled pork, 1
This place is an amazing venue! It's a theatre in the round with a stage that slowly turns! No matter where you sit you have a great seat! It's not CRAZY loud but sounds awesome!!!! Good bar. The only thing that sucked was only one girls bathroom! Lol! Can't wait to see what else is coming here! Just saw 3 Doors Down! Loved it!, 1
I stubled across this place on Leith Walk by chance as it isn't obviously signed nor is it well established yet in the area.  It's aiming for a fresh, 1
Only really looked through the dress section - which was clean and well organized.  It's in the Tatum Desert Ridge shopping plaza and there are a lot of good stores here.  Was able to happily walk out with 2 new dresses and the cashier was very friendly.  No complaints here!  Overall: A, 1
Google maps will lead you past this tiny restaurant if you're heading West on Spring Mountain Road. The icon will show that you need to pass Hauck street. Don't make that mistake, 1
I have wanted to go to the Stockyard, 1
I really like this bar. Each time I've been here, 1
Damn good dogs and cold beer. What's not to like., 1
We went here on Feb 13 and everything was absolutely delicious! Our waiter was Marcus and he was excellent.  They prepared a variety of dishes tailored to our tastes and they were fantastic.  The drinks were incredible too.  I had a cucumber martini and also some other martini with passion fruit. Would completely recommend again. Even though the food is pricey, 1
why only 3.5 stars, 1
Another place I have been going to for quite a while, 1
My family and I have been here several times and every experience we've had here has been great! My four year old LOVES their French toast so much that she refuses to try anything else! Their pecan waffles and pancakes are fantastic and their eggs are always cooked perfectly. The waitresses already recognize us and are always friendly and welcoming. We've met the owner, 1
Long line to get in.  You can make reservations online which I highly recommend.    The food was delicious and macarons were very good too.    Prime rib, 1
Starving after a long hard day of shopping and hitting the slot machines and craps table...I was looking forward to a good lunner (lunch and dinner combined).  We ended up at the All-American Bar & Grille where I'm told they have awesome steaks and burgers.   Reading through the menu, 1
Authentic British food served by British expiats. Queen Victoria's Pub is located inside The Riviera Hotel. There are many British food favorites on the menu like Bangers, 1
Dozen has creative flavors and generous portions of frosting on each of their cupcakes.  Fresh cake, 1
Their chicken pad Thai is awesome!, 1
My wife and I went here for lunch this weekend.  I got their 1/2 salad and 1/2 sandwich combo.  There aren't as many sandwich options as I would have liked so I tried the chicken one.  It was ok but not memorable.  A real piece of grilled chicken (not sliced/processed stuff) and some peppers.  It was ok.  The bread was good though.  For my salad I got the wedge and it was excellent.  Crisp and creamy just the way I like it.  Also, 1
Went there one extremely hungover Sunday and cured it with a pint and cheese on toast. This was no ordinary cheese on toast however. It was on two thick slabs of wholemeal bread with about an inch of various melted cheeses with some chopped up raw chilli just to blow away the cobwebs.  Probably the best hungover / hair of the dog combos I've had in a while.The barmaid like, 1
Cups cake are big and the frosting compliments the cupcake. The cupcakes were moist.  I hate having dry cupcakes. Oreo cupcake was beyond delicious.  A little disappointed because they didn't have red velvet cupcakes. Overall I would recommend this place., 1
Wonderful experience! All the staff is beyond helpful and great to work with from start to finish.  They're very thorough and knowledgeable., 1
I don't eat pork at all and that's their specialty, 1
Its a cool place to go, 1
Pretty neat outlet with many neat stores all around. Went to just polo and burberry and bought a lot of their stuff due to the right sales and price. There were a lot of stores but felt like only some were just there to fill the space, 1
Adore! The prices are enough to make me head over heals for the place.  Add to this unique flavors not found anywhere else on State, 1
Bellagio, 1
Thank you Mirage for being overbooked this week, 1
Amazing!!! Great sandwiches, 1
Open 24 hours. The cafe is called Images & located in the back. Old school feel & look to it all. 2nd hand smoke galore.  My fiance and I went there because I was craving liver and she found out that they are one of the few places which still serve it. I was not disappointed. Bonus!: the french dip she ordered was A-mazing.  Their service was fantastic as well. Our waitress, 1
XS is my most frequented nightclub in Vegas, 1
I like hanging out here with the girls on Wednesdays. Good food and drinks fun atmosphere. Sometimes the band they have playing is fun but sometimes they're absolutely horrible. We still manage to have fun regardless. Wait staff is always friendly but sometimes it's hard to get someone to help you but that's understandable considering they're crazy packed on Wednesday for ladies night., 1
This is the first Cirque du Soleil show that I've ever seen so take this with a grain of salt. Overall I loved Love! The music is fantastic, 1
I grew up eating bentos since I'm from Hawaii and I was thrilled to find this store. The bentos here are delish!! You do have to come early to get them tho since I believe they do run out quickly. I once stopped in during the mid afternoon and they were all sold out.  Now I usually stop by around 11 am.    The store inventory is pretty low but I don't really care since I just come here for their bentos and aloha maid drinks., 1
Hands down VERY BEST sandwich shop in Henderson and Vegas that I have ever been to (20 year resident). Food is awesome, 1
Great place for a quick cheap breakfast. We were in town from Jersey for a baseball game last weekend and as close to a Jersey diner I've seen in the Midwest. The waitresses were all business so be ready to order. Our whole party left full and pleasantly plump., 1
Traveling to Sin City with Kids  I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't leave my baby, 1
Menu was really easy to read, 1
It was good. I'm not big into eating crazy healthy, 1
Thumbs up for the 50 cents - 1 dollar menu. Just got a 2 full bags of food for 2 and two drinks for 8 bucks. Taco bell's menu of cheap items are left in the dust here. Food is fresh for fast food., 1
Heute war ich zum ersten Mal zum Kinofr\u00fchst\u00fcck in der Schauburg. Sicher nicht zum letzten Mal.  Kosten 12 Euro f\u00fcr Film und Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksbuffet. Klasse Preis! Zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gibt es Br\u00f6tchen, 1
My favorite restaurant in Vegas!  Their menu is seasonal and takes of advantage of local produce - just a wonderful slow food movement type of restaurant.   The charcuterie is soooo good.  And the cheese selection is the best I've had bar none, 1
4 stars for the Nacho Mama's! Pulled chicken and pub cheese adorn a half-circles of what appears to be homemade corn tortilla chips. Sides have varied from a green salsa to a smokey red chipotle, 1
Was going to subway, 1
I stop in to Tuvalu once a week for some hot coffee and a delicious bacon breakfast burrito.  Served with a side of salsa, 1
If you live in south Scottsdale or ASU region of Tempe and have not been here you need to go. They have games, 1
I actually used Yelp to find Green for the first time. I can't say I've been to a quality vegetarian restaurant until Green.   The atmosphere was a little trendy for my tastes, 1
Started with the Dumplings (steamed) very nice sauce served with it. Then for the Drunken Noddles that i saw reviewed. OMG so good. Be prepared if you order medium spice. Its got the kind of flavor that leaves your tongue tingling in the way Thai food should. Looking forward to coming back., 1
No surprises what this place specialises in.  I love this restaurant. I always have a small chowder to start, 1
Great place for first visit. Going back. I went for eyelash extensions. Very professional., 1
OMG I LOVE DICK'S! Wow that sounds bad, 1
I have to say i love this place. The wait might be long but worth it..Everytime we eat here the food is great. Its a cute country atmosphere.. I love the fresh squeezed orange juice an the coffee is great. Even in my hometown we have one an it is just as good. We have made this a reg spot to eat. The staff is great an always have a smile on their face. They are also very helpful when ordering food making suggestions when you ask which is great. I would recommend this place to everyone., 1
This cozy place has mighty tasty tapas! We tried 7 of the 10 offerings and enjoyed them all. Stopped short of "having the lot."  The only shortcoming is that the menu had only 10 items.  Looking forward to a return stop at Lola's, 1
Ahhhhh...TI knows how to treat a lady like me! Big spacious rooms, 1
Once a trip I always find a way to come. The upstairs cafe has "local" take out dishes that are hard to find elsewhere. The crowd is 90% Hawaiian so it's a very friendly place. As far as the rooms, 1
Had their crepes Parisian that was excellent. Very good service from a friendly waiter who spoke three languages, 1
Denise was so nice and she did a great job.  Do not let the other review scare you. She did a wonderful job. Went over the color choices and gave suggestions on what the appropriate color choice would be, 1
4 years later still a solid spot for a lunch buffet.  They raised their prices a bit from the $8.95 I remember to around $10.50 for lunch but it's still an incredible value. Where else can you find a great mix of Korean, 1
I sat at the bar and had the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  As is typical with a tasting menu, 1
Thank god the tiki bar is open!  Love this place as it is the ONLY tiki bar in Phoenix.  It is excellent though.  Happy Hour is a terrific deal filled with urban hipsters on the patio with the light rail buzzing by.  Eat there or venture in to the restaurant and enjoy delicious tropical drinks with fare such as jerk pork, 1
This is the only supply store I go to...  The people that work here are so friendly and helpful!! Over the past 4 years, 1
This new SCA resident was very impressed with first experience. The atmosphere was fun, 1
I never feel rushed with her. I am 22 and am not pregnant, 1
Absolutely love their Death by Chocolate flavor., 1
Great FAST Pizza.  I hate waiting for my pizza, 1
Be kind to me since this is my first a Yelp review. I am reviewing the Foot Spa that I discovered in Las Vegas about a year ago. I have a favorite therapist named Linda who has very strong hands and good technique. This last sessions started with an ion detox foot bath, 1
Great place to me locals and even Hawaiian tourist!   Okay, 1
This review is for the Terrace at the Differant Point of View. We got here about 5pm on Friday for a Birthday gathering. We first started out outside on the Terrace but, 1
Love their dragon sushi roll, 1
1. Awesome job in ambiance and location 2. excellent service 3. Menu variety  This place is a diamond in rough. It's got class and appeals to a variety of appetites, 1
Got a sandwich the a week ago on my way out of town.  It was pretty darn good, 1
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  The first time we stepped foot into Flying Biscuit was in Atlanta.  Whenever we visit our friend in ATL we would always go to the Midtown location.  We'd get there around 8:00am, 1
Yay! I just happen to be their 100th reviewer!  First of all, 1
Great appetizers and beer selection. Good specials, 1
Best Hawaiian/Filipino fusion ever. I love their food. Service is good. I usually get their lumpia and some kind of rice dish. Students from my school come here all.the.time., 1
We made a reservation for a special holiday group lunch. Even though the cafe was slammed, 1
A beautiful spring day and my garden fever is in full swing. Like a junkie to a 7-11   I hit up Summer winds and get the mother lode.  They had beautiful veggies, 1
Ok. Let's see. I got the white tip with gel & I'm pretty happy! If you want something simple with no designs or have time for the frills then I def recommend this place. However I was a little put off from the cleanliness & dated decor, 1
I have mixed feelings about this restaurant.  I mean, 1
This is my new burger favorite.  And will be one of those iconic vegas eateries I HAVE to eat before heading back to LA.    I was so impressed.  Foodwise.  Their service was lackluster as they were understaffed. And our server was seldom seen.    I had the shogun burger. But eventually, 1
I'll make this short and sweet.  I LOVE CRACKER BARREL.  Food is always delicious and service is super fast and always great., 1
This QT was amazing. I stopped in for the first time on my way to work today, 1
After walking the strip for quite some time in the mid-morning hours, 1
Found this on Yelp, 1
This casino is kind of jungle themed ... with all the plants and fish every where. Loved the Beetles show here and the volcano show! I really want to see the tigers next time!, 1
I can't believe I went to this store, 1
No really - if this place goes anywhere Phoenix;  AZ for that matter will have lost something monumental.  I am not over exagerrating when I say, 1
My regular fast food joint. This location, 1
This place is great!  The food is very tasty.  The prices are low and the staff is really nice.  I really enjoy going there for lunch because they serve you a spring roll and soup as soon as you walk in.    They have the best spring rolls I've ever had!  Their dinner menu has a lot of good dishes to choose from.    I also liked that it is set in a diner atmosphere., 1
After hearing raves about this place from Food Network shows, 1
Pete's is amazing. This is more of a public service announcement than a review. Sorry, 1
Now the drinks are fucking expensive as fuck, 1
I can say that this place was a delightful experience. Came out to Vegas for a weekend with my ladies to celebrate a birthday, 1
Tasty food with great options.  If you want to eat here, 1
Get the pork belly buns.  Did you get that? PORK BELLY BUNS.  Stop reading this and order them already., 1
Off all the half marathons I've run in the rock 'n roll series, 1
I really love this place.  If you want to sit on a bar stool, 1
This place gets a 10 as far as Mexican baking goes. Their produce is gread quality and fairly priced too. I come mainly for the Mexican wedding cake. You can buy it by the slice and sit at the counter and eat it. It is moist and too die for. Too bad most white Americans have never tasted a slice! They cook authentic Mexican food. You can take it to go or just eat it there. There is no wait staff but they have a dining area and counter. The food is great and very fairly priced. Every one I'd always nice.  The main language spoke is spanish. The owner is Tomas, 1
Das AndreasBr\u00e4u ist in Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen eine Art Pilgerst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr Alt und Jung. Das Publikum ist sehr gemischt.    Wie es sich f\u00fcr ein Brauhaus geh\u00f6rt, 1
I've never used a service like this before & it's genius. I have scoliosis so I can't do any heavy lifting at all. We needed furniture, 1
I went to the Hash House A GoGo located in the Imperial Palace on Dec 29th. My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast. It was pretty crowded, 1
They hem pants in an hour and they're open on Sundays. What's not to love? I've had two pairs of pants hemmed here (when you're short all of the pants you buy are going to need to be hemmed) and both times they've done them in an hour while I walked around East Towne Mall. Plus their prices are on the lower end of the spectrum. Quick, 1
It has the best bake sweet potato in the deep fried version, 1
awesome architecture outside and great movies inside!  make sure you buy your discounted passes from your AAA office!, 1
I have lunch here all the time. The veggie wrap, 1
This is my favorite place for cheese steaks, 1
Thin crust personal pizzas that are made to order and cooked in a super hot oven so they're ready in a flash. Very tasty!  They have some suggested combinations of toppings to choose from. Otherwise, 1
My co-workers and I visit Park Lanes quite often for lunch and usually enjoy it!  They have a very interesting menu like gourmet salads, 1
I went to Hop Doddy yesterday at lunch.  As usual I had a great experience. This place never disappoints.  I got the regular bacon cheeseburger and added a fried egg and guacamole.  I asked for medium rare and the burger was cooked to perfection.  I also love love their truffle fries and their Maine root coke.   I first had burgers at this restaurant in Austin and the Scottsdale location is just as good!!   My friend got a raspberry white chocolate milk shake and loved that as well.    Great place and I will keep going back., 1
Went to Vegas recently for a childhood friend's twenty-first birthday shindig. Our first night there the girls wanted to have ample time to get ready. The Venetian gave us the number of this Papa John's as a place that would deliver to the hotel lobby.   The person that took my order was courteous and patient. He reiterated what hotel guest service had already told us: they'll deliver it to the hotel lobby, 1
Great place for chicken. I come here about 3 times a month, 1
I love this place. Even though it's fast food, 1
Best beer store in Charlotte, 1
I quite like pink olive! It's a really nice place to go for a lunch with the girls, 1
I am absolutely in love with this place! The people that work there are super nice and helpful. They give you a free meatball if it's your first time there and it's the best meatball I've ever eaten. We got a platter of them which comes with little pieces of bread. Amazing! After we were done with those, 1
This is my new favorite hotel in Madison - the bed was so comfy. Normally it's hard to sleep in a new place the first night, 1
My husband and I had a great experience working with Emily and Karman (her second shooter) for our wedding. We were planning our wedding from afar (we were living in Maryland, 1
I had a craving for corn beef sandwich and my favie place in Sq. Hill closed a couple years ago. So I did an online search and this place showed up with fabbie reviews. My hubby and I popped in and ordered the 2 O'riely's and a Szmidt made with corn beef instead of pastrami as well as one of their ginormous dougbies and one must not forget the soda of the day (Today was black cherry cream) the shop is quaint LOVED LOVED LOVED all the quotes and wedding photos. The owner was so friendly and easy to talk to about all the different homemade menu items. We truly enjoyed the food will definitely be back as well as spread the word. Yummy Yummy, 1
I only go for the movies or when I know what I'm getting.  Not much of a shopper but I remember having fun here when I still lived in L.A. and came to visit., 1
Never been to a teppanyaki restaurant before and needless to say, 1
Great place for the price. Clean and stylish, 1
I frequent this location the most since it is closest to my house. There's always great text deals and usually they're pretty fast.  The shakes are really filling but hey if you're down with that go for it -- after 8pm they're half price!  The other great thing?  Breakfast ALL DAY.  I'm in love with their burritos, 1
I usually go there to watch NFL game on Thu. Almost same table every time. Servers are friendly and they know your order in advance. Food is OK, 1
This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh.  Fantastic food, 1
If I was given the option to eat nothing but meat for the rest of my life (and stay healthy) I would do it. And if it could be nothing but fried meat with gravy smothered all over it... even better. Yet here I am at a vegan restaurant... and I ate every single bite of my diablo red... and I'm excited to come back... has Hell frozen over my friends!? I doubt it. I think Green just has an absolutely phenomenal chef. Kristen's secret barbecue chicken sandwich was great too, 1
Had lunch here with my co worker for the first time, 1
I found Blanca via yelp when I first moved here for my Mom. We were new to Vegas and I was so used to having Yelp's help with finding good hair people..Problem is this towns salons lack QUANITY reviews but Blanca had quality so I sent my Mom in as a our tester.. I AM SO THANKFUL I did. Blanca not only has done a excellent job on my Mothers hair. She is now our go to for the whole family.     I am the Mother of  Bi- Racial children who were blessed with a unique type of hair. Not the typical small curls but ALOT of poof and blonde under tones so my son's hair looks TERRIBLE if it is put into a fade. Upon hearing about the horror stories I encountered when first arriving here Blanca was able to tell us EXACTLY what to do with his hair. She did a WONDERFUL job and she is GREAT with kids.     Now as far as my hair goes.. I HAVE THICK HORSE STYLE HAIR. I have wanted highlights for so long but nobody has EVER been able to get it right until Blanca. Not only that but she did Low lights too and does AMAZING STYLING. BEST YET SHES FRIENDLY and LISTENS and she is Affordable. Please if you are looking for someone you can trust that is loyal to her clients and knows her craft give her a try. Keep in mind her QUALITY never is Compromised so sometimes you may have to wait a bit if a appointment runs over but its WORTH THE WAIT!!!!! Everyone else in the shop seems friendly and awesome too.. No complaints.. I am so BLESSED to finally have found a Salon I TRUST, 1
The Best Happy Hour on the face of planet! Seriously, 1
I have wanted to visit Ethel M's for years, 1
Liked everything I tried- great crowd when I was there., 1
Definitely delicious but I have to say all their drinks are for people with a HUGE sweet tooth.  I couldn't even finish my white hot chocolate.  Definitely tasted like straight melted chocolate but it was soo good!!!  Ordered a bunch of food here and got full off of that so we had to cancel our dessert.  Definitely missed out cause it seems like this place is meant for sweets all the way.  Got the turkey sandwich- good but not anything out of the ordinary Salmon- interesting take on salmon - i loved the wasabi mayo  probably come back to try desserts =), 1
Great portions, 1
What a great place! We read the reviews. We were fascinated by the review about male lambs. We thought an epicurean restaurant with a sense of humor worth trying. I called for a reservation speaking French. My kind. Je parle francais comme un vache Espanol. The ma\u00eetre de said h\u00e9 did not understand Chinese. Lol!  The restaurant is beautiful and quiet. The food was fabulous. Escargot Au vol-Au-vent was terrific. The cote de Veau was tender and tasty. The Lapin was quite nice- no bones.  A just and ultimate French meal in this wondrous City. Our last.  Waiting for the souffle.   The maitre de was very funny., 1
I only go about once a year when visiting a friend but if I didn't live 887 miles away I would be there a few times a week. The sandwich selection is great- even for vegetarians! The fact that you can grab a single beer out of the cooler yourself to go with your sandwich amazes me., 1
I go there once a month or so with friends.  Yeh, 1
I stumbled across this location while shopping at BEBE. Staff was nice. Selection was meh, 1
I said I wouldnt be back, 1
Just returned from a great first time at Four Peaks. After much debate on what to drink, 1
Simple short review. You can't go wrong here.  You get what you pay for. Order different burgers and fries and share with friends.   It's a popular place.  Be prepare to wait a bit., 1
First time on WN....PHX to LAS 10:35 Mon morning 28 Dec...checked in online day before and got A pos 42....always preferred other airlines because I could choose my seat in advance and have frequent flyer mileage....luckily got first row window with more leg room....attendants were as friendly as I've ever had...left and arrived on time...will probably fly WN again, 1
Le Thai has some really good dishes.  Three Color Curry has mix of red, 1
Best Atmosphere for any hour of the day for sure.  Every dish that I have ordered there has been fantastic!  The pretzel bread on their burger is amazing!  The only reason that I give 4 stars rather than 5 is the service- I have had my order messed up and it seems to take a little longer than I think it should be HOWEVER they are ALWAYS busy so that needs to be taken into account.  Maybe they should have another server on, 1
We ordered a cake for my son's 10th Birthday.  It was not your typical cake, 1
Quaint little Italian restaurant in the Venetian with good food and very good service. Had the spaghetti and beef meatballs which tasted fresh and clean. Not the most flavorful dish but certainly delicious. It's not super expensive but it is Vegas, 1
Well I finally tried eating here.  Fantastic steak, 1
John Kelly Veronica Greg you guys rock we always know were gonna have a good time at rocks....and if you disagree its because your there when we're not if I'm not working or staying walking distance from home this is where we be! Love it...the cabana club pool rocks to but this is my spot. Although it's not necessarily inexpensive you get a drink that's worth the cost! Unless you order drinks not top shelf or drink beer (cuz i dont here but i love beer) then i dont know...and with that being said TIP your bartenders don't be cheap they deserve it!, 1
I finally got around to trying out Rudy's and was not disappointed.  The food and service were very good. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, 1
This place is great and I eat here often. The food is very good and the prices are great.  Took a friend and we ordered egg rolls, 1
I've stayed at the Vdara twice & both times did not disappoint.  I love staying here for its modern appeal inside the rooms.  Had great views both times & had a speedy check-in.  The second time I stayed here, 1
I ate here really late on the night of July 5th with a lady friend and it was just fantastic!!!!!!  The bar-b-que chicken pizza was just great and they had a pretty view of the Vegas strip facing North towards the Wynn.  Our waiter did a great job his name was either Dan or Caesar. He was totally cool to talk to and gave us some great advice about the different clubs in Vegas on our trip., 1
Great service and the food was very tasty, 1
So are we supposed to put our reviews here, 1
This was seriously one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. I had the spicy ground pork dish - it was almost a religious experience. I'll definitely be back. As soon as I can!, 1
SQUEE. I love ice cream. I love Dairy Queen. I love Dairy Queen ice cream.  Mainly I visit this for the oh-so-close-to-home Blizzard craving that comes about, 1
I first heard of Buffalo Exchange last year in California where I got a Juicy Couture jacket for 15 bucks. It reminded me a lot of Plato's Closet, 1
I truly enjoyed this place. Super clean, 1
Had a Birthday party here last month and this place was amazing, 1
Everytime I had any hair question or concern I turned to Lacey, 1
My first foray into the Pittsburgh Bagel Factory was about a year ago to use one of the Groupons they run periodically.  The prices are reasonable, 1
A place that wins my mama's heart, 1
I like it..... It reminds me of Sharkeez back in Cali.  I even like it better when it's a 10 dollar cover, 1
I didn't even need ketchup!  I'm not the biggest fan of red meat but I must say this place was pretty good. I usually need ketchup with red meat but not here, 1
First time here.. Other than being out of a couple of draft beers, 1
I needed to eat something soupy and great for a cold.  What else would've been better than ramen?!    Picked out this place based on the reviews and the pictures.  We went there for dinner and there were lots of parking available.  We were seated right away, 1
Stopped by Mark's for a quick bite to eat last night.  Both outside and in the place looks like an ordinary, 1
Kids had a half day and we decided to take them bowling and grab lunch.  They have a great deal $15 - 2 games, 1
3 Words - Portobello Mushroom Soup., 1
This is a good place for a quick meal. Service was very quick and courteous. I didn't like the fact my soup came out with everyone's entr\u00e9e (versus first and then serve all entrees together) but I am told by my friend who is Chinese that is how they serve the food. Good food at a fair price. Perfect place when you want something tangible but quick., 1
I just hate the fact, 1
I had been eyeing this place for a year. The friendly signage made me think that it would be good, 1
Small and very busy. Very good coffee with a team behind the counter making coffee in a "we know what we are doing" way. In other words making good coffee fast with out the snooty, 1
We stayed here January 2012 and loved it! We are faithful Harrah's Properties guests and they comp us very fairly! This was our first PH stay and we really enjoyed it! My partner and I are both in our 40's and come to Vegas twice a year. We found PH to be young and hip and very Vegas... We liked the energy and style. Service was good right from the front desk and everywhere there after. The location in the center strip can't be beat and the views can be spectacular. Definately request strip/fountain views. The room was cleaned to our satisfaction daily though maybe showing some nicks and dings and wear... We will not complain because the price was great and the suite pretty darn awesome. We asked for a Panarama Suite and got 1601 on the 16th floor ...facing MGM/NYNY etc but the panaramic view was wonderful! We watched sunsets and rises and the strip lights...awesome! Be sure to soak in the huge tub! Use the wet bar for evening parties and coffee in the morning! The beds were comfortable and above average but maybe could be more luxurious? Lots of high styled furniture and movie memorabilia! We found we stayed in the room more than on trips when we stay in lesser rooms. The Miracle mile shops will keep you captivated for days... And the food choices are plentiful! Both offer a a range of price from very affordable to higher end. Again, 1
So- how did I find Dr. Spoon you all ask?? On YELP of course!!  Who knew, 1
Saw this place on Bar Rescue and happened to be going to Vegas the following weekend. We wanted a change-up from the touristy scene so we came to Bar 702. Lisa the manager was very friendly and working her butt off! I sat down and played video poker for about 20 min, 1
In a lot of ways, 1
Great Greek food! Calamari was fabulous! Brochettes couldn't be beat. Wonderful place for the kids as well. And the price was right being able to BYOB. Best of all, 1
The best yoga studio in the country, 1
Been here a few times and have had good experiences each time. Happy hour is the best in the north valley. Craft beers galor on tap. Food is excellent as well., 1
Love that there is such a nice, 1
I wrote a previous review that was not recommended for some reason but I feel strongly enough to write a second review. P.A. Alice Peterson went the extra mile in performing my latest physical and I could not be more appreciative of her efforts. She takes the time to make sure he asks the right questions and makes it easy for you to understand what is taking place. As for the office I've encountered no problems with reaching them or setting an appointment.  Lee H. Casa Grande, 1
I have been going to Haji Baba for about 18 years now and I have to say, 1
This place is authentic. This place is legit. It is not purposely modified to fit the non-Japanese palate which means that this place offers sushi in its truest sense. The entire experience at Kabuto accurately reflected our experience at a high end sushi restaurant in Tokyo, 1
There's so much to like at The Penguin:  a ridiculously large basket of sweet potato fries, 1
Sarafino's is a lively but cozy place with a pleasant ambiance and good food.  I appreciate that the offerings are purposely prepared in a straight-forward manner, 1
My wife and I love this place.  The service is always excellent and every dish we've had is off the hook.  I love the shrimp and grits and the shrimp poboy.  The poboy is the best I've had outside of New Orleans when I lived there.  My wife loves the scallops which is an occasional special.  Great for kids, 1
I normally go for reverse happy hour on Sundays! I have only had good experiences at RA! I dont really do sushi but I do drinks specials, 1
Wow what a freindly place. First time there and Nick was so helpful. Will go back, 1
HISTORIC LATTA PLANTATION Come check out this historica plantation if you're into old history about how farm life and slavery was back in the days in North Carolina. Small quaint houses and animals adorn this quiet farmstead. Luckily for me, 1
The fresh tortillas, 1
Dr. Jackson and her staff are second to none.  Positive, 1
How much do I love breakfast at the 5th Ave Cafe?  A ton.  This is my new favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.  I used to try to go to Matt's Big Breakfast but honestly it isn't worth a two or greater hour wait for bacon and eggs.    First of all, 1
My husband had never been to a Trader Joe's before (born and bred here in LV too, 1
A true gem for PHX and the west valley area. The owner provides an intimate experience and isn't afraid to offer insight on the best way to partake of the dishes. All the food was absolutely fantastic!, 1
The staff was friendly and we got a great rate! The staff was very accommodating with early check in and late check out. Love the indoor pool and balconies! Enjoyed the experience!, 1
I highly recommend this Barbershop, 1
Cool store. Helpful employees and fun place to visit. If you haven't heard- you get all the samples of oil/vinegar/wine/liquor you want. In fact, 1
On our continuing mission to hit all of the good little coffee shops in the valley, 1
I can't say I'm always an advocate of their parent company, 1
It's a great church, 1
We stopped in here after dinner in the area. Even though we'd already eaten, 1
OK so the bf is a few years younger than I. Just a tad. OK. So, 1
I think I loved this store a little too much. Especially since I walked in, 1
I agree w/the last posters...GREAT FOOD!...I usually as a rule shy away from chain restaurants but this has KILLER food and a decnt bar.....crawfish are OFF DA HOOK!, 1
Very friendly and quick service, 1
In the mood for a good ol' country style breakfast? Enter John's. Nestled in the strip of Plaza's main shopperies, 1
Good place, 1
This place is true authentic Teriyaki Japanese food.  You can order a bowl, 1
They are the best in Henderson. Always love my pedicure and waxing is awesome.  Yes they talk in their language but they have learned english and speak very respectfully . They are super nice.  I only like to visit this salon  have been going for the last 6 months . Never had a problem with fungus. It is family run I think . I bring all my friends  here. Well priced too, 1
I have to come here when I go to vegas.  My favorite meal of the day is breakfast and do they serve it!  Huge portions!  Sadly I always come here Sunday morning which is the worst time to go.  I end up waiting for an hour.  But that's okay, 1
I agree with everything the previous review said. This place is as authentic as it gets on this side of the border. My regular order is two tacos al pastor and a manzanita. The people here are friendly and helpful. They used to be open until 3am on the weekends but I think that has changed.   They also operate a food truck on McDowell between 24th and 32nd Street on the North side of McDowell., 1
LYFE Kitchen is typical california cuisine.  I had the Fish Tacos, 1
Anyone who is familiar with the night scene in Scottsdale, 1
Love this place! It is a must visit everytime we go to Vegas. The food is huge portions, 1
Very great pedicure, 1
American Junkie is a great addiition to Scottsdale its laid back but hip at the same time. I can't really say much about this place except for watch out for the line it gets crazy and they have bottle service here which I think is a joke I would compare it to Maloney's having bottle service......ridiculous!, 1
03.23.2013: I used to live in Vegas and this was always my place where I would go. So fast forward about 4 years and guess what? They did not disappoint. This was my wedding day and time had slipped away from me so I called and they told me to come in. I was so happy that this was still "my place." One person remembered me from years back and there seemed to be some of the same people which I didn't expect. The person who did my nails did my nails and did it perfectly. The gentleman who did my feet was great and 1 1/2 weeks later, 1
The 5 stars is for my regular stylist, 1
I love this exhibit! It's a must see. I've gone twice, 1
I have been here twice in the last few weeks and really enjoyed the food and view the porch seating. They have nice little touches like adding cucumbers to the water. Excellent humus. I have tried the chicken kabobs and brisquit..both were a little salty, 1
I am upgrading my rating of this Smith's to 4-stars, 1
If you're looking for something a bit more upscale than Za's on campus and Biaggi's is out of your price range, 1
OK for spring training time of year this place can be a real lot of fun, 1
I really enjoyed my spa experience at the MGM's Grand Spa.  I stayed at the MGM Signature and the spa is located right at the end of the tunnel for Tower 1.  The spa location feels very isolated from the casino and i found it to be very relaxing.   You receive a robe, 1
Went here last evening and it was super busy. Waited about 15 minutes to be seated and then we were placed at a table which was right between the bar and some booths. Which were both packed.  So it was super. Fucking. Noisy. Which was great for my anxiety!  Food wise, 1
Decided to check this place out since they don't have these back in The Bay. Favorite place to get a sandwich now, 1
Every other time before this current trip to Vegas I would have given Earl's 5 stars. Let me explain...I am a regular here in Vegas coming about almost every 2-3 months. Earls is my go to place every single time. One being they are right within the hotel I stay at (Planet Hollywood/Elara), 1
Everyone knows about the good food.  This one had good management as well, 1
It's the newest terminal for McCarran. It's like a mall, 1
Can someone please enlighten me? I wonder if I'm spoiled, 1
Love it!! Went there for the first time in Dec 2013 with a friend and was told the wait will be long because it is just a "bar, 1
Thanks to Yelp and my fellow Yelpers, 1
If you are going to THE Fabulous Las Vegas, 1
A very nice buffet! With 32 unique food stations, 1
I come to Rubio's for one thing, 1
Skeptical at first.  Who orders a 60buck burger?  Who do you think you are blowing paper on a...BURGER??   Well, 1
Absolutely amazing breakfast. I had the waffles, 1
Recently rented a car from Enterprise and had great service.  The car was ready, 1
This is basically for Shaina who with unbelievable skill and dexterity, 1
Pretty good food.  The orange chicken was a bit TOO sweet, 1
We went here at an odd time (3-ish) and we were greeted with a smile. Every dish we tried was delicious. Garlic chicken, 1
We were again near the Pig & Pickle and he who must eat willed the car to stop and I couldn't be happier. It was early so we had the happy hour menu . First there was the mint julep and a great pilsner beer (thanks Kat for the suggestion!) We enjoyed the chefs choice  home made charcuterie...there were 3 different home made breads, 1
I just got a quote on a property in Las Vegas, 1
The hubby & I stayed @ Aria in late September.  We hit up the buffet for breakfast, 1
One of my favorite places to eat pizza in the valley. Every flavor of pizza rocks. Live the decor. Heat lamps outside. Nice., 1
Went with my son (age 20) on 7-17-14 and Noe was his barber. We did not have an appointment but they go him in with Noe. WOW is all I can say! What a great experience and haircut. My son had been in LA earlier in the summer and got a cut he loved and couldn't stop raving about but NOE blew him away.  As a former cosmetologist, 1
Quite impressed with this wee place - everything is cooked from fresh and there's a wide selection of pasta dishes, 1
The chips and black bean salsa that are complimentary are amazing. We ordered the SOL guacamole. It has a perfect blend of goat cheese and mango added. Simply delicious and well balanced flavors. I ordered a jalape\u00f1o margarita which was average (same as you'll taste in any AZ restaurant). We choose a la cart tacos. Here is where extra stars come in. I like hot food. Ghost pepper hot and the hottest wings never phase me. Then comes their viper taco... Great blend of flavors and a sauce so hot no amount of water will chill the heat. A+, 1
We LOVE Razzoo's.  We wish they had one in Gastonia. Please come to Gastonia! Their stuffed fish is to DIE FOR! Everything on the menu is GREAT! The atmosphere is quirky and fun. The service is friendly and laid-back. We try to take out-of-towners here for good food and fun., 1
So I finally got to visit Topshop/Topman and i must say i'm loving the pieces they have. Very up to date and fashionable. For all you fashionistas out there this is a great place to shop.  I liked a lot of their clothes but i'm more on the heavy set so i really don't know if their stuff would fit me, 1
The French baguette that they serve at the beginning was awesome. The onion soup is delicious and not really like your typical French onion soup. The French fries are also very good., 1
Pho Saigon 8 is one of my most recommended places to eat (:. Me and my family are regulars there, 1
Visting Montreal (Le Plateau Mont Royal area) for a few weeks with my family (husband and 2 teenagers).  After one week in Montreal we were tired of walking around to find a restaurant that looked good to go into... there is an enormous amount of gyros, 1
I love Waitrose! As a student I am always trying to find the cheapest deals, 1
I've been using R and C Pest Control for over 2 years now and their service is top notch!  KC has been spraying outside my house once a month and it is rare to see any bugs on my property.  I had ants that were getting into my upstairs bathroom by climbing up a neighbors tree that hung over my roof.  When I told KC, 1
On Saturday night after some drinking at the Wynn, 1
Hugs and kisses to the staff and management at The Porch!  I have lived in Pittsburgh for what seems like 8, 1
My friend and I went here for a late lunch.  It was our first time, 1
"First time here after Yelp reviews. We had a party of six during busy breakfast hour on a Saturday. Staff was very accommodating in getting us seated with very friendly service and excellent food.", 1
This is a great place in the Henderson/Green Valley area if you are looking for a hookah lounge with a nice Mediterranean menu., 1
If you're hankering for some real Texas BBQ on the Southside of town look no further. Albeit this place is smack dab in the ghetto but when you walk inside the atmosphere is very rodeo-ish.  The guys behind the counter are extremely friendly they even offer samples. MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH!!!! I hate it when restaurants make you pay cash, 1
Did not actually go there in person, 1
Being from the southeast, 1
The City of Madison continues to impress me with its food offerings; most recently, 1
Brunch at Eden is a real treat.  I went on a Saturday and must say I was impressed.  They have these drinks with stivia sweetener.  Get all of them.  I had an Omelet and it was  well made.  I can see what people see in this place.  The food sounds more comlex then it is and really what you get is just tastey non pretentious vegetarian meal.   Prices and service were both good.  Not the best ever but more then fine.  I will go back., 1
The burgers... Taste like real beef and not fillers! Delicious! The fries weren't my favorite part of the meal. I had the Cajun, 1
Boston roll was pretty good, 1
First time here.  I'm a Glendale native and always saw this place, 1
I was introduced to this place by my trainer Derek. I met the owner he's such a sweet heart and has huge arms lol all the employees have always been very sweet as well. I've tried about 4 different things on the menu already PH breakfast burrito, 1
The store: Stumbled onto this place while I was in Vegas for a month.  Has a great selection of Indian spices, 1
This place is no frills, 1
I am probably the worst person to go to clubs. I can't stand bottle service which I think is a rip off and really dont appreciate many of the other things. This place was great. the people in it wanted to have a good time and the dancing was fun. The views are amazing and about the only thing outside that I thought would have been good is some form of heating. I will come back next time I am in town., 1
We went here for happy hour. The service was a little slow, 1
Pete was professional, 1
The wife and I wanted to use a coupon here before the expiration date of 9/5/11 that we got from an Elite event.   I can easily think of five reasons for a five start:  1. Set up- I like the idea of having my own booth and having some privacy.  (Compared to the Korean BBQ upstairs)  2. Waitresses were very attentive. She also picked up my wife is the expert here, 1
Nice place have been back multiple times.  Unpretentious on the outside, 1
My wife and I love the large portions, 1
On our first day in Montreal we wandered by Brasserie T! and decided to give it a go. While we didn't have a reservation (it never would have occurred to me to make a reservation for Thursday lunch), 1
I'm updating this one and upgrading it to a 5 because now that the Centennial Yogurtland has been overrun with huge families with out-of-control children..... Menchie's has become my #1 favorite froyo place.  Some great things about Menchie's (as compared to Yogurtland):  *  Never crowded (I hope this doesn't mean they'll be closing soon!!) *  Easy access to sample cups.  At Yogurtland you have to ask for a sample cup, 1
My favorite burger place in the Las Vegas area so far. Have tried Bobby flays burger palace and Mario batalis B&B, 1
The advent and subsequent proliferation of the Indian buffet has been a boon to America.  Even back in my homeland of Kansas I was only blocks away from one.  Mint Indian Bistro fills the gap that my recent relocation created.  Their masalas and curries are great and genuinely spicy.  They also have just as many vegetarian options as they do options for carnivores, 1
Highly recommended! I called Scott to have him move a gas line in my backyard.  He arrived as expected, 1
My new go-to source for all things hair! I wouldn't trust anyone but Rick with my hair!  Rick Patrick over-exceeds my expectations! Last time--not only did he fit me in last min. and stay late (starting at 5pm at Sat. night!!!!), 1
I was about to buy a new set of tires at Walmart, 1
This place is epic! I mean... they have seriously ruined street tacos for me forever. No where else I go will ever measure up to this place. I admit I only tried the spicy pork and head tacos, 1
Had a really good time here, 1
Restaurants should be rewarded for taking care of business and having good employees.  I arrived 10 mins before lunch hr was over but had to go to the cox store. I walked in an Tamara the host helped me. I asked if I could order my lunch so I can get the lunch special but run to cox quick. I hate missing the lunch special. She honored my order. I came back an the food came out 5 mins later. Kudos. Thank you Tamara!, 1
If anybody is still going to the big supplement chain stores you are out of your mind! At vegas discount nutrition you literally pay 1/2 of what you would at those places! And if you figure what shipping would cost and then having to wait for it if you bought it online you would find that its way better to come here., 1
Every spring we spend two weeks in Phoenix for spring training.  Each year we go to Haps several times for a quick lunch.  We stick with the sandwiches - pulled pork, 1
This was the 2nd year we have stayed at this resort & plan on going back again next year.  We traded our timeshare for a week here at this resort.  We had a 2 bedroom (actually a full size unit with a smaller lock-off  unit) a full-size kitchen, 1
Usually am a proponent of diversity, 1
Lovely Blynk location smack dab at the center of Uptown! I've been to the other Blynk near 4th and Tryon but have yet to try this one even though it's closer to work. I was jonesing for a sandwich--not too big but not too small and happened to have a 25% off sandwich or salad coupon from the Yelp Elite Holiday Detox event (which I may have swipes more than two)  I like this location better than the other because it has actually seating and is just more visually pleasing to the eye. I went before the lunch rush and was in and out in three months. Amen to that! I got the Chicken Twist sandwich and it was packed with flavor from the basil yogurt sauce to the fresh, 1
I was so happy when this place opened up. I love crepes but out here so many people mess them up. This place, 1
I love this location! Every time I have come here there has been a bit of a line, 1

Sukiyaki is such a fun word to say and Swish is a great place to go.  Healthy, 1
Outstanding food and service Michael Baker's singing is excellent Highly recommend for the family, 1
Fat Tire on Tap!  Their food was great.  Chicken nachos and asian chicken wings.  Bartender was very nice and open to customers explaining a shot and then making it.  Turned out to be a great shot!  His inverted jager bomb was genius!  Going back for sure!, 1
Food: 4 Service: N/A Ambiance: 3 I always eat breakfast here at least once each trip. Love the bagel bar with lox and white fish and pickled herring. Lots of seniors (like me, 1
I was so impressed with the cake we ordered for my mother's birthday. It was not only beautiful but absolutely delicious. We will definitely be ordering from them again., 1
Really enjoyed it. My tip is to get the cheese plate. Beautiful presentation and plentiful. Also tried the crab cake with apple and arugula. Very good. Can't wait to go back. Nice wine by the glass selection too., 1
Situated near Broughton, 1
my friend and I decided to eat here because of the four star on Yelp. and it worths it.   my friend ordered beef short ribs and kimchi fried rice. beef short ribs was really tasteful and tender. kimchi fried rice was better than other places i tried before.   I ordered bi bim guk su, 1
We were able to catch the American Modernism exhibit at the Bellagio and it was a nice break from the heat and the casinos.  You know, 1
Annie at AJ's is the type of person you want to do your alterations.    Not only is she bluntly honest (one time I came in wearing a skirt at a length she REFUSED to let me leave with- so she pinned it up), 1
Picked up a Vegas weekly mag and it highlighted this place for its Nachos. Next day I checked it out for myself. Bulgogi nachos/fries are legit...can't go wrong., 1

Really craving a good Mexican dinner, 1
Not all bars are the center of the hipster universe. And that's perfectly fine if all you wanna do is have a drink or two and just wind down. Sometimes you just want to do a little chillin'. Like a villain. Or like Ferdinand Magellan. Whatever the case, 1
Great food and great margaritas! Fun atmosphere too! I wish the place had more seating because sometimes it's hard to get a table! I recommend going right after work before it gets crowded!, 1
While leaving from school the other day, 1
Great! They were able to accommodate me for two separate afternoons of moving help, 1
I have been dying to come here during my last few visits to the Wynn. There is a long wait for Red 8 but the food is good and the prices aren't bad. It is an above average Chinese restaurant as far as quality and ambiance., 1
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I never give 5 stars.  Truly this place has gotta be the best Prime Rib I've ever had!  We went around the holidays so I really enjoyed the "ol fashioned strolling carolers".  The service was impeccable, 1
Let me start by saying that this is a 5 STAR REVIEW for a Sports Bar, 1
My love loves this place. We basically come here for brunch every time we come to Vegas. I love their patio, 1
One of the better Jiffy Lube services I've been to. The store is kept up very well and everything seems to be extremely clean. I was in and out for my old change within 15 mins. Great service!, 1
Tao is the best place in Vegas ! The flavors are unmatched ! Every single dish we ordered from the hamachi with truffle sauce to the biggest fortune cookie and banana pudding was amazing. Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas, 1
After nearly two years of going without espresso(Okay, 1
The smoky smell of grilled chicken lured me in from downtown phx. The chicken is grilled over fire and the style is truly "Sinaloa." The chicken comes with rice, 1
While staying in Las Vegas working we stumbled across this place after coming down with a cold and needing some hot soap.  The wonton soup is the best I've EVER had.  They make it with lots of stuffed  wontons, 1
When I came to Scottsdale for a weekend visit a friend of mine suggested we come here on a Saturday night. We were always big fans of Mickey's Hangover and heard that this place was kind of the same vibe but "a little more Scottsdale." I was kind of skeptical when I heard this description and figured the place was gonna be VERY Scottsdale with very little Mickey's. Well, 1
Delicious!! The food came out very quick and it was hot and fresh. The waiters were attentive but not annoying. I had the Shrimp Lo Mien and Orange Chicken.  The noodles were great and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Prob the best Orange Chicken I've had here in AZ.  My girl had the Shrimp and vegetables and I tried some and it was also very good. Even my ice tea was good :). I recommend this place, 1

The 5 start rating is for the Oxtail Soup.  I've been eating this soup for the past 13 years.  After driving 5 hours from San Diego to Las Vegas, 1
The Porkster rehab burger was enough food for two days and the pot brownies are delicious. So good., 1
One of the best Thai restaurants I've been. We were seated right away on a Saturday evening, 1
Mac's is my favorite place for bbq in Charlotte. It is located only about 5 minutes outside of uptown on South Blvd and they are rockin!! I always start out with the wings as they are slow cooked and grilled, 1
For the rate i had to pay ($24/night), 1
Love this place it is a 7 mile trip for us and worth the ride. Have been going here for 6 mo now. We have never  had any thing that wasn't great.Friendly Service they are right on top of it from taking your order to the delivery. The best cannoli in town. My wife is a Italian and swears by there food. The girls that work there are very nice and always smiling. We highly recommend this restaurant., 1
God I miss the Dilworth outpost. Really, 1
I visited this place on a recent vacation to Tempe and it was the highlight of my trip. I am an ex firefighter and this place brought back many memories. My favorite was the Hall of Heros, 1
I religiously watch MasterChef, 1
My wife and I had breakfast at Margie's yesterday before catching a flight back to Boston.  The coffee was good, 1
Just ate at this Pei Wei location for the first time tonight and I was impressed!   Was spotless, 1
I noticed some of the reviews were not so great. Fortunately, 1
Best mexican fast food in the Mesa area that I've found so far.  I personally find their crunchy tacos are more well seasoned then their traditional soft tacos. Which is a little weird; but I imagine, 1
Simply the best Lebanese food that I've had in the States. Superb. The prices are also reasonable, 1
I have been here twice now and will be going back again.  Each time I have ordered the special of the day and haven't been disappointed.  The mock meat has more flavor than 'real' meat in each of the sandwiches I had.  In fact, 1
One of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas in a long time. Located in Crystals shopping center in Aria, 1
Great spot to watch games in summerlin, 1
Wonderful steak, 1
I wish I didn't have to work so early in the morning, 1
Fun course. Check out the night golf during the summer. They have a range too., 1
Now that I moved back to this side of town, 1
Quick and convenient. The gentleman who did my fingerprinting was kind and helpful. Just $10 as opposed to other places charging $30. I had no problem finding the place, 1
I've seen a few acupuncturists over the years and just tried Don for the first time.  I'm so happy to have found him.  He seems very knowledgable and he has a very comforting way about him.  I'll be a regular customer., 1
New breakfast place on the Shea corridor. They have some real unique dishes with a European flavor. Really good coffee tho it can get a little loud in there. Get there by 10am or you will have a wait. Enjoy!, 1
Best service & casual dining in the Cosmo by far!!!!, 1
Make sure your ass can stand about an hour just to get in., 1
Had the meat ravioli and a side of sausage. Amazing food. Wife got penne with vodka sauce and grilled chicken. She requested we come back again which is rare for her. I will gladly oblige the next time we're in town. Diamond in the rough off the strip., 1
I love everything about this steakhouse.  I waited until after our second visit to write a review just to be accurate...our meal was perfect yet again.   As we were celebrating my birthday on our latest visit, 1
I don't remember most of the nights I've spent here over the last 10 years... all I can really say is that a trip to Vegas isn't  really a trip to Vegas unless it involves at least one drunken black out courtesy of the Double Down.   Oh and guess what? The DD has been doing bacon martinis looooong before hipsters made All Things Bacon part of their Hipster Repertoire.  My steady is always Vodka with Something. It doesn't really matter what the "Something" is because I'm not gonna taste it anyway. That's how stiff the drinks are.   It hasn't changed much... though they did get rid of the couches I was always afraid to sit on for fear a syringe would crawl out and poke me in the ass. Oh hai, 1
Awesome service with good dependable food, 1
We showed up looking for steak, 1
very yummy!!!!!  i could eat here every single day and never tire of it.  little on the spensy side, 1
We ate here after our flight was delayed and we arrived at 2 a.m.. My husband and I  were starving so we figured we might as well grab a bite to eat. They were offering the late night menu which was limited but offered a lot of good options. We opted to go for the nachos with steak and chicken tenders. We got a huge portion of the nachos but we really didn't like the nacho cheese sauce that they used. The chicken tenders were cooked perfectly with the sides of ranch and barbecue sauce complimenting it well. I got the house made lemonade which was delicious. The server was attentive and refilled my lemonade quickly.  minus 1 for the nacho cheese sauce but overall a great late night meal., 1
We originally dealt with Steven Sales as our Agent to buy a home in Henderson in 2011. We dealt with him long distance from New Jersey and met with him to look at homes in Henderson. He was totally professional and on target with our requirements and we found the perfect home and the whole transaction was handled by him here as we returned to New Jersey. He made the deal quick and easy for us and handled all the details so all we had to do was move here and move in to our new home. He recently helped us find the perfect rental for our Granddaughter here in Henderson and she loves the place that he found for her. I would recommend Steven Sales to the most discriminating clientele and have confidence that he would satisfy all of their needs. He is by far and away the best real estate agent I have ever dealt with over the years., 1
Here's a tip: While perusing the menu, 1
You can't go wrong with Gordon Ramsay. The environment may be a bit off from a classy fine dining, 1
Looking through the reviews for Eat Unique, 1
I've been coming to Moishe's since I was a kid. It was our go-to family restaurant in the 70s and 80s. The decor has been updated and the waiters are as professional as they come. This is not a fancy restaurant, 1
Great place to go for a smile!! The staff at every Dutch Bros here and even out of state has the best employees. They are so upbeat and clearly know customer service!! This is a big deal!! I have had the energy drink with pomegranate flavor shot, 1
Another favorite to add to my list of good Chinese restaurants in Madison. Double 10 has a very small dining area, 1
Book Buyers has tons of a great used books for low prices. I love browsing through the store. After Kurt Vonnegut died, 1
5 stars    I'm Indian and I've reviewed more Indian restaurants in the Valley than probably anyone on Yelp. I was not expecting this place to be so good based on the earlier reviews. However, 1
food was fresh and delicious and very flavorful. everything on the menu sounds great! we will definitely be back! prices are pretty good except for the fact that if you order their specialty salads, 1
this place is awsome, 1
Went here for dinner with the family on sat night, 1
The service at the restaurant was great, 1
omg, 1
Eversince my husband found this place, 1
We just left the MGM after enjoying 3 great nights! This was our first time staying here and we were pleasantly surprised! Usually when we come to Vegas we stay at Caesars properties but wanting to try something different I booked through MLife. We got such a great rate on our grand king room. When we checked in I asked if we could have a higher floor and the fd agent was more than accommodating. He got us a room on the 27th floor which was perfect! The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable! We never had any issues with extra charges and they even waived the late check out fee for us! It is a little far from where we're use to stay on the strip but the monorail is super easy and not pricey. Can't wait to stay here again!, 1
I'm a fan of the simple, 1
Not much you say about the Steelers that the sports world doesn't already know. The Steelers are the model for what all Professional Football teams strive to be. From the ownership, 1

When traveling on business, 1
We left around 9am.  That is apparently a pretty early time to leave Seamless.  A very memorable time here although I was a little out of it.  Good times all around.  Definitely would love to go back.  Limo rides to and from were even more memorable. I think the limo ride there is reimbursed with paid cover., 1
Best club ever. Beautiful people, 1
I know it is going sound strange to hear that I had a great experience at the dentist. Especially when you consider the fact that I  lost a filling and had to get a crown. To most that sounds like the beginning of a horror show, 1
Tourist trap? Maybe, 1
Excellent grilled trout with mango salsa. Steak burrito rocks! Superb table service, 1
Everything you want in a good bar: Strong drinks. Quick bartenders. Cheap pool tables. Good jukebox.  Amazing little hooks in the high tables for pool cues.   Yes. Go there., 1
why hello there, 1
Truly a classic - when you go in to this place you feel like you are stepping back into the 40's or 50's (especially when the weather is warm and you come in through the very dark bar area with the tiny curved booths and dozen bar stools).  We always make a point to dine here when attending a Badger football game and ALWAYS are sure to make a reservation well in advance.  I have probably eaten there 5 or 6 times and always enjoy the ambiance, 1
I actually enjoy working on cars - sometimes - and know enough to realize when a mechanic is feeding me a line of BS.  If I'm not in the mood to do the repair myself, 1

I have enjoyed Archie's Deli before but never wrote a review. I told my friends about it and they were dying to try a new (kosher-style) deli on the west side. We agreed that the "old place, 1
This has been pretty much a weekly lunch destination for me and my coworkers.  A couple of our favorites:  Crunchy tofu extra crunchy Spicy pork spring mix bowl  Spicy pork ramen   The owner does seasonal ramens and dishes, 1

Great fried chicken at reasonable prices.  I'm not a fried chicken expert, 1
There are not too many alternatives for fresh produce and organic food in and around Surprise. So, 1
This is the SPOT!  Groups...or individual.  "Spicy Shrimp Tempura" cut roll. I get this all the time...everytime. Sometimes have 'em add cream cheese.  I miss one of the sushi chef's that used to work there. He knew my order as soon as I walked in the door!  P.s. Bay Area....needs to step it up and get on the All You Can Eat boat. I'm so sick of a la carte. *exhale*, 1
Love this place. Been there two times, 1
The menu is short and sweet. But I bet you cannot go wrong with anything! We started with the miso soup, 1
We did a beer flight. The Refuge IPA and the Bear Wallow were stand outs. We were given a total of 8 beers to sample.  We also ordered the green chili pulled pork sliders. They were great. My only complaint is that the food is served on disposable tray. This is not Eco Friendly.  I would prefer to see reusable plates., 1
War am Samstag dort 100 Jahre Malerei, 1
No wonder Lonely Planet recommends Le Bourlingueur as the sole place to eat in Old Montreal.  Situated in a quiet corner of the old city half a block from the basilica, 1
Well I feel conspicuous as well as comfortable. I'm 57 and don't match the average demographic sitting amidst the "Retro" inspired gathering place. I like it.....reminds me of some of the haunts in downtowns of Portland, 1
Ah Zorba's, 1
There are new owners for this place as of three weeks ago or so.  I went in for lunch today and everything was the same.  Same great fresh food and reasonable prices.  Although my wife and I were the only ones in the restaurant at the time, 1
This restaurant reminds me of some of the typical buffet style Chop Suey houses we had in Honolulu back in 1980's. Though, 1
We ate here on one of the nights we were in Vegas and I am absolutely a fan of this place. The service was excellent, 1
Authentic Mexican, 1
Love the seasonal Pumpkin Porter. It's darker than I normally order, 1
I needed pizza and not big-box pizza.  I wanted a real pizza experience.  I knew Chizona's is where I could get it.  I try to go here for lunch as often as I can.  This last trip, 1
Really liked this place! My group of 12 ventured here during a nite tours club crawl, 1
I tried the new pretzle crust last night and my wife got the toastes garlic cheese crust. Both pizzas were very tasty. It says 45 mins for delivery and was on time. Driver was nice and appreciative of his tip. I got the hand tossed style pizza.  I will say, 1
I was here for my friend's bachelorette party and they were the best! Server was awesome and the manager helped get my friend and on stage. Going to be back!!, 1
I have stayed here three or four times since I wrote my first review.  The place is consistently good.  I had a chance to hang out in the lobby lounge as well as the attached restaurant/bar (District).  Both top notch with nice people about (both staff and clientele).  Expect, 1
I was really pleasantly surprised by this place. Small restaurant but it was consistently busy so we decided to try.  Smaller menu but our tacos were very good!, 1
I love Ultimate Lawn Maintenance!  I have used their services at two of my houses.  I called them the night before last and told them my sprinkler was broken and was causing water to gush out into the street.  They had someone out the next day and I figured while they were there, 1
Best juices in town! I I am addicted to the wellness and antioxidant juice. Nice clean location as well.... Oh yeah can't forget about the turkey burgers!, 1
I had the lucky chance to score a Living Social voucher to attend CrossFit Las Vegas's On Ramp introductory session.  It is definitely introductory, 1
Rented a subcompact car from this Enterprise location. Arrived at scheduled time and there were no sub-compact cars available, 1
This review is mainly based on the service and a cool manager that took care of us there. Food is your typical sports bar/ chain type but was pretty good. Wait staff was very attentive, 1
We couldn't have had a more pleasant dining experience!!  My kid sister, 1
It's been a long time since I wanted to give a joint 6*s -  but, 1
Servings are huge and delicious! The banana bread is OMGahhhhh yummy!!!!!, 1
While walking by I noticed a sign for bubble drinks and was immediately drawn in. I asked if they had a menu of their dessert drinks and the owner showed me to a table and turned the menu to the proper page. I looked through it and was a tad sad that it didn't list almond as one of the flavors they carry but decided on taro.  On a lark, 1
This is one of my favourite ice cream shops in North America, 1
this place is SHOCK and AWE! once you walk in it has the WOW affect. too steep for my wallet but enjoyed the property. very clean, 1
Great and definately a unique tasting experience.  To start my date and I did wander around at the beginning questioning whether it was a seat yourself type affair but were promptly and cordially greeted by staff who soon turned to our server.  He explained the concept of the food and tastings.  We soon found ourselves indecisive of what to choose but ended up taking the food and drink pairing substituting some of the items for savory foie gras and seafood.  The courses were art on plates and a firework of flavor in your mouth.  We were thrilled to catch it when they were open and actually came across it by chance.  The restaurant is a bit of a curiosity while driving but word of mouth is primarily how we heard of it.    I'll be a return for a special occasion to wow some guests or family members.  A majority may find that the pricing is a bit high and afterwards though the tasting was amazing I actually had to eat somemore afterwards.  It is a tasting but the stimulation on my appetite was so intense that the satiation factor had to be quelled with another meal., 1
we really loved this place. Popped in on a saturday for lunch - pretty empty. Loved the decor and the staff was friendly (I see in other reviews this has been an issue). I ordered a pannini sandwich with mozzarella, 1
What a great bar and grill!  Everytime, 1
The second I walked in the door, 1
Words cannot describe how much the BF and I love the Hakkasan restaurants.  We were amazed by the Miami location, 1
I love this little shop! My brothers girlfriend Jess took me here because we both have an affinity towards unusual vintage finds and it did not dissapoint. Their prices are very reasonable too. I will definitely come back often, 1
i feel the need to address Lauren B's comment below.  i'm a guy so it might be different for me and i'm sorry that lauren had a bad experience.  but in my opinion, 1
I have been coming here since I was little.  Some people do not like the mom and pop restaurant because they are not that modern.  I think these are places are great. This is a great place to go.  They have a lot of good old fashioned comfort food.  This place is very simple so if you are looking for a grand place this is not it.  But good food and good people are always here. Very family freindly., 1
Haven't actually been to the Deer valley Culvers (but will soon, 1
One of my favorite late-night spots in Pittsburgh. Great selection of American fare and DELICIOUS appetizers. Half-off 11pm-1am, 1
Moved here from LA after seeing the same colorist for over 7 years. I was terrified to try someone new after so long with the same person and I have found the transition easy, 1
We've started coming here for lunch a few years ago.  The 2 slice pizza special is very good, 1
I noticed this shiny new Chili's on a recent trip to the Aria.  I LOVE a good buffalo chicken salad so I was pretty excited, 1
Zhanna has been my stylist for more than  15 years.  I love going to her for so many years, 1
This place is truly a must go to for people in Green Valley area that are a fan of sushi, 1
Stopped here to grab lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. We participated in the brunch menu, 1
You pay for what to get.  This is still one of the nicer places to stay and play at.  Overall good experiences each I stay here., 1
The Trader Joe's chain is my all-time favorite grocery store, 1
Both times I have visited Shabu I left full and happy. This hot pot idea is great for groups as everyone can sample and share their way through the menu. Last time we ordered the ying yang pot (choice of 2 broths) with the lemon grass and house spicy. I loved the lemongrass but they were not joking around with the red chilies in the house spicy. Some of my favorite things to throw in the pot:  Baby bok choy Dumplings Oyster mushrooms Oval noodles Shabu beef Scallops  The service has always been fast and friendly with the server filling up our broth consistently throughout the night. The interior is typical cool Johnny Chu with anime running in the backgound on the other side. Stop in and give this place a try. The unique concept shouldn't be missed!, 1
We dined at the Steakhouse after hearing great things about it from other locals.  It is indeed a jewel in the middle of a cesspool of a dying casino.  I have been reluctant to dine here mainly because of its location but I regret not dining here sooner.  The waiting staff is attentive, 1
I've been going to the Salt Cellar for years. I find the food to be consistently good and the service is outstanding.  We went for dinner last night and it was up to par.  We ordered our standard fare which is:  Shrimp San Remo appetizer (so, 1
I think I went on a Friday for dinner. Cost me about $42 bucks and honestly, 1
Or La Taverne Monkland.  Very good food, 1
What a delicious lunch I had here.  It's pretty small. I'd say it looks pretty hole in the wall. Most of the seating is booths and there are some Thai artwork on the walls. There was only one woman serving and hosting. Which kind of was lame. All things aside the review is ultimately for food and then the cost related to the experience.   I had a Thai tea for $2.50 which was really good! Some places miss the actual tea flavor. This was the perfect size for the prize  and the flavor was really good. This is probably my favorite Thai tea in town.  We got the stuffed chicken wings aka angel wings as a starter.  For $10 I thought the wings could be bigger. It came with two. Maybe add a third one or make the two bigger. They were good. Came out hot and with sweet and sour sauce. A solid 4 out of 5.  For entrees we had pad se ewe, 1
Pastrami is fabulous. Most flavorful and tender we've had. If you want a lean meat then don't go pastrami-ever!  We couldn't believe the generous portions. The matzo ball soup is a must try, 1
My sister randomly selected Public Kitchen and Bar for Father's Day dinner with my family this year. How could such a random selection lead to such a perfect meal? I've since been one more time, 1
Great store!  I come here to buy baby shower gifts and the store layout is synced with the baby registry printout which contains only the items that have not been purchased and available at the store and online.  Customer Service is good, 1
The rooms here are not large; they are average size but very well maintained and cleaned. If you stay here make sure you find Toi (wish i knew her last name), 1
We found ourselves in Uptown Charlotte one day for lunch and wanted to try someplace we hadn't been to before.  We went down Tryon St, 1
This is probably the bets Whole Foods location in Arizona.  No disappointments when it comes to Whole Foods.  They deliver on every level and the staff is always in a good mood.  You can't beat the healthy lifestyle choices they have and create., 1
I had the pleasure of having Blackstrap BBQ cater our weekend lunch party at work last week and after hearing that there is finally a Louisiana style BBQ joint in MTL, 1
Love the d\u00e9cor and ambiance of Culinary Dropout! They offer both indoor and outdoor seating- both great choices, 1

I haven't had the food here, 1
I called the owner Monday to discuss what occurred Saturday evening. He was completely apologetic and professional. He asked us to give him a second chance, 1
This was the go to spot for all my peers in high school, 1
Came here about a week after they opened.  They were still training staff, 1
This event made me soooo happy! I found out about it from a retweet on Roaming Hunger's website. I'm from LA and have waiting in line forever for some of these trucks, 1
The shogun burger is freakin incredible!  Wagyu beef mixed with unagi then topped off with foie gras, 1
Tammy and the whole team at the Scottsdale Jazzericse Center are in a word - AMAZING! They are so caring about their members, 1
Very nice little place. Friendly staff. We went for lunch, 1
Exceeded my expectations!  I hired Warren's on behalf of an out of state client who needed ALL of the contents of his vacation home moved into storage.  The guys showed up on time and expertly packaged and moved all the contents and moved them to the storage unit w/o a problem on their part.  As a Realtor, 1
If you are thinking about participating in a yoga teacher training, 1
BEST ice cream joint in town!  I love supporting small local businesses and this one comes with sugar on top!, 1
Great expeirience eating here for the first time!! Enjoyed a great Pie with a buddy of mine, 1
I kind of wavered on whether I should write a review about Zipps - my reasoning was based on #1 it's a sports bar and #2, 1
In the Cosmopolitan there is an un-named pizza place that has some pretty good pizza slices. I had the Supreme and the White Pizza. Both were delicious and very flavorful, 1
Great sushi chefs! Owners are great! Beautiful place with chill patio. Highly recommended., 1
My lovely yelper and friend had their tenth anniversary some years ago and thought it would be nice the day before NYE to eat here before year ends.  She made reservation months in advance so dinner was set for four.  It was a busy night as we enter into what looked to be a bar/entrance to the restaurant.  There, 1
I love this place. You'll definitely feel the zen when you eat here! I lived in Japan & always wished there was a place in Las Vegas that was similar to taste & atmosphere to that of a Japanese Curry Shop & this is the place! The female waitress has top notch customer service & is very genuine and helpful! The curry menu has expanded & you can basically get traditional japanese curry to create your own type of curry! I would definitely recommend this place to any one looking for Japanese styled curry or is willing to try something new!, 1
Finally made it to Bonterra... after some planning, 1
I recently attended the Bonham Bubbles event here which showcased the hotel and restaurant's collaboration with Piper-Heidsieck champagne. - For just \u00a350 you are treated either to a three course meal or afternoon tea, 1
LOVED the tiramisu gelato.  It was difficult to choose between the nutella, 1
Food: n/a Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Decor & Style: 5/5  Well it is probably the nicest club I've ever been in my life. Obviously you're gonna need $$$$ and some more $$, 1
I've been to Someburros a few times now - it's all been takeout so I can't speak to the service but I absolutely enjoy the food.  They have a big menu with tons of a la carte choices, 1
I am so happy I finally got to check this one off my bookmark list. This place is truly one of a kind, 1
Arrrrrrrrrrrgh!  There is a deck with plexiglass walls overlooking the show at Treasure Island. You can have your pear martini AND see shirtless men in spandex on a pirate boat. YEAH! The space is smaller than other clubs around, 1
My only issue with this place is that it is quite hot in the restaurant and the service was a tad bit slow. But the food is worth it, 1
i've been eating at this place for many many years.  the cioppino and Bouillabaisse is some of the best i've ever had.  Although the restaurant has changed over the years and the service isn't as good as it has been.  the quality of the fish stews are great!.  If you are into these tasty fish concoctions, 1
Short version: every health care professional in the country should be required to tour this place to see how it's done.  Long version: Facing a possible serious health condition I grew tired of waiting for my primary to refer me to a specialist and called Mayo.  They accepted my insurance (United Healthcare) and scheduled an appt within a week.  Leading up to my appointment I received 3 calls - preregistration they call it - each designed to make my first visit as fast and easy as possible.  For my first appt they actually had me in early.  I had a lengthy discussion with a cardiologist named Dr. Click, 1
Food: Viva Las Vegas pizza - This pizza was quite tasty! There was a generous amount of cheese and the roasted garlic really came through. The fire roasted tomatoes were a great touch!  Garlic parmesan chips - Although, 1
I stop here weekly for the delicious, 1
Last night a few of us went to Genghis after work to have some Mongolian BBQ and drinks.  It was Friday, 1
So the BF was in Vegas for the first time for his birthday and he picked CUT as his expensive steakhouse dinner.  We were not disappointed.  Wolfgang Puck figured it out with this place.  First off, 1
I have been to this location of Papa Murphy's on many occasions and love it. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is always great. The ingredients are fresh, 1
Went for drinks after getting into Vegas at 11pm on a Friday night.  Great way to start our weekend!  Even though it was freezing outside (~40 degrees), 1
This place has the best poutine in Montreal. A local friend of mine brought me here and it was the most mindmelting experience of my life. We got the ground beef and sausage poutines and I have to say that I have never had poutine as good as what I've had here. The environment is nice and I'd definitely suggest bringing any visitors to the city here., 1
Int\u00e9ressante microbrasserie! Les bi\u00e8res sont brass\u00e9es sur place, 1
This gig has been going on for quite awhile now... This place is all about volunteer workers (service & kitchen work) and about giving back to the Montreal community.  They support 4 local charities (La Chainon, 1
So...I do not eat much Mexican food....but this place is excellent. A great variety of menu items above and beyond the usual boring choices you would find anyplace else. Not to mention the amazing service. I might have to start eating Mexican more often....plus I live right around the corner....don't know what took me so long to try this place., 1
What a fun night we had at this place! No wait for a table, 1
Still loving the food!  The crispy shrimp taco's are my fav.  The shrimp are huge, 1
Yum Yum Yum.  I've been here a number of times and it is consistently one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  The regular burger with cheddar, 1
Great store with a huge collection. They accepted an exchange on a Gerber knife even more than a year later because the bad kept slipping loose. Great service by that manager. Some of the other staff didn't really seem to know their product... a little disappointing.  But still a great rei with some good sales we took advantage of   They also had an indoor wall which was pretty cool and a great idea. We didn't make it in time to climb ourselves but would be a great tool trying out some new gear., 1
As a non-whiskey drinker, 1
This is the best Fox concept! I've only had the best service and the food... I could get fat with how much I would eat the food here!   For appys get the calamari. Served sort of like a salad with arugula and a light lemon vinaigrette sauce.  The gnocchi is my go to meal and rightfully so. This dish so unbelievably rich yet so satisfy. The sauce it's in has this tanginess that makes the dish stand out. The chicken parm is a typical chicken parm but the freshness of the ingredients (everything is fresh!) sets it apart.  The servers are very knowledgable on with the wine list. If I'm ever stuck on what to pick they always have a great suggestion.   Amazing spot for a cozy date or catching up with friends. Good job Sam Fox!, 1
Love that Gilbert AZ is coming up in the world. When I moved to Chandler, 1
Loved the smoky drinks! Next time will definitely try the other flavors! Great place to come and relax while walking the trip! Service was fast and helpful couldn't have asked for anything more., 1
Omg had so much fun...i think. I volunteered since me and my boyfriend were both skeptics about hypnotism we both decided i should be the one up there. We bought the dvd since i cant really recall the events but i did know what i was doing sorta. After the dvd purchase Kevin the hypnotist came by and signed the dvd.  Great guy n fun show.....i think.  After the show i got approached by some audience members saying how i was really good n funny. After watching myself on dvd i cant stop laughing. Im pretty hilarious n entertaining apparently under hypnosis. Show worth watching if your in town.   Disclaimer: not for people easily offended n shy., 1
Great place to hang out and chill. Would be cool if they played up to date happening music., 1
Great gel manicure (thanks Bee), 1
I had a valentines dinner there and it was good!  My boyfriend and I are vegetarians (ovo-lacto), 1
very nice store. the selections are fairly good for all types of animals. they at ban field vets have a traveling aviary doctor which was a little inconvenient seeing as I needed one that day. the bird toys are slim for large birds. the bird foods and treats selections is very good. I like the dog treat section also they have a much better variety than the average grocery store or wal mart. one of my dogs is a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs 3lbs she is no bigger than a can of soda with legs and has very few teeth. the training rewards treats are perfect for her tiny mouth and soft enough for her to chew.  I have walked around the store some and all areas have a good variety to choose from no matter what you are looking for.  I love that I can take my animals in the store. the staff has always been very attentive and friendly, 1
I love this restaurant! It's very small and cozy, 1
Clean hotel.  No casino in here so it was really nice just to walk in and out of the hotel without smelling much smoke.  The pool was decent size but nice.  Plenty of seats.  I just love the building much more than the room itself although the bathroom was pretty large.  I still prefer Palazzo/Venetian over this though., 1
Great spot for shopping and dining.  I usually go around lunch time and so far haven't had any problems finding a parking spot., 1
I can't believe I never left a review. It was a little expensive and there was some waiting, 1
Long overdue yelp review but maybe now it can be a little more impartial, 1
This place is quite an experience.  Food wise would be 2.5 stars (specially because of the price tag) but the place and service made up for 1.5 more :)  The service is amazing and the place is beautiful. There were two weddings and it looked like a lot of fun (for the guests, 1
Was here Sat/13 Jul about 11:30 pm. - My buddy and I had the   http://www.OnTheRocksLasVegas.com/ticket-information/   (3 Day Pass) wristband which got us in to Tryst without waiting in line and not having to pay a cover charge. - The club is as posh as XS (which I'd say is the best Vegas club overall) and gorgeous with the waterfall behind the DJ booth.  Tryst is one Yelp star short of XS because it's a smaller venue (indoor and outdoor) so it gets crowded easily, 1
I would refer to Dante as either the safest cooking store in the world or the tastiest gun supply shop in the world.  Think of Arnold Schwarznegger and Martha Stewart head shopping together this is where they would come!  Either way... it's an odd combo but has worked for almost six decades!  I heard from a co-worker this was the place to come for a pasta machine I didn't think also you could get a 12 gauge shotgun there as well!    Some really high quality items are found both in guns, 1
Kaba Curry is a curry house, 1
Size matters. The sheer variety of the stock here makes up for some of its vagaries in stocking.  In recent months, 1
I have been visiting Vegas lately, 1
The deep dish pizza here is always amazing.  I get the BBQ chicken and bacon with extra cilantro on top.....THE BEST!!!!  The service is usually sub-par but it's Vegas.  Unless you're at a high-end restaurant, 1
We had heard of Hot n Juicy and decided to give it a whirl. But on a Saturday night it was about a 45min wait. Deciding that we would save the experience for another night led us to try Blooming Spot Mini Pot around the corner - that's another story and a good find too!  Always having it in the back of my mind I got into a conversation with a fellow co-worker about this crawfish crazed place. I also noticed it had two locations on Spring Mountain Rd. so they must be doing something right. He convinced me to skip the hype and go straight for the Boiling Crab. I had already visited Crab Corner so I figured it was going to be similar in style.  I call our night at the Boiling Crab, 1
Just had a layover in Charlotte, 1
I`ve had just about everything on the menu and have loved it all. This week I`m strung out on the pork chops. We had Jim and Joanne cater our company christmas party and it was so awesome i decided to do the same for my family christmas get together. It may have been the first year there weren`t any left overs. I highly recommend this place. Great people, 1
4.0 Stars  SMOKED SALMON SANDWICH why are you so delicious?   With your caper dill cream cheese, 1
A Chipotle even closer to me!  We ordered to go and I noticed that you can even order online. There was no one there probably because no one realizes that it's opened yet but it is!  We ordered the usual...a chicken burrito and a Barbacoa bowl. They put a bunch of meat in my bowl but not enough rice which is fine. My meat was a bit on the dry side but I'm sure they are still working out the kinks. Overall it's still one of my favorite semi fast food places., 1
Right across the street from Fashion Square, 1
Authentic Italian small restaurant - nice marinara sauce - ordered bruschetta, 1
Sat down once, 1
03/07/13 DINNER  WOW!  That's the word for this evening.   WOW!  We had been here before, 1
This place is pretty freakin' adorable and pretty damn good, 1
I'm giving a good review because I appreciate that they allowed me to return a pair of shoes that my wife had purchased.  She had only worn them 1 time but they were definitely showing some signs of wear...I would have given 5 stars but the girl who helped me had a little more attitude than I felt was necessary., 1
Came here when it was my first night in AZ.  Good environment, 1
The newest addition to the 'Brass Monkey' family launched on Friday night, 1
This is a great place. The food is fantastic; like a trip to the Blue Mountains & the staff, 1
The kentucky bone in steak is the best.  Ive tried all the steaks you have to try it.  The drinks are kind of expensive.   The tuna is just alright but there breads are great.   Give them a shot great steak., 1
I cannot really tell you anything about the menu in this restaurant because we eat in the bar during happy hour. The wings here are amazing. They are smoked which gives them a great underpinning of flavor, 1
Update here folks- was here yesterday 4-26-2014 & they had a lobster burrito featured, 1
One of the best shows I have ever seen!   Got a huge cup of some sort of frozen concoction in the lobby on the way in and were greeted by "warriors" all above us I think "threatening" us and doing jumps over our heads. Great entrance.  Then the show...WOW. The stage is so amazing by itself. The performers are equally amazing. There is not too much karate, 1
I came in here with my neighbor! I ordered the steak and cheese and he ordered the meatball sub. Not only was our order fast, 1
My wife and I come here every week, 1
Went there for breakfast.Food was great and the service, 1
I came here on my bday for my first visit! Didn't know what to expect, 1
Man! This place is BUSY! I'm adding another star for excellent customer service. I came in on friday at about 12:30. Woah! All of the tables were full and the line was about 15 ppl deep. The line moves fairly quickly. I ordered my rotisserie chicken, 1
I got the red velvet pancakes. They were SO good and the cream cheese icing on top was money! My friend got the ham and cheese omelet which was really good too. Their orange juice is aaaaamazingg!!! I always look for fresh squeezed oj and honestly this place has it!!! Amazing I tell you. The staff was super friendly we had multiple servers check on us which means they work as a team which is great. I'd definitely come again! Ps. Try and get the food truck into Unlv's campus! I'd go there im between classes for sure!, 1
Salud quickly become one of my favorite watering holes in Charlotte. This place makes you feel right at home the second you walk in. Jason and crew are very accessible, 1
I have been searching for a curry place in Vegas that I would always enjoy love going to and I have found it at Japanese Curry Zen.   Inside the restaurant is really small and calm, 1
As a pool owner in Az Companies come and go. I have been taken more than once. I found Peoria pool and electric. Located on Grand Ave Peoria Az. I have finally found a Company who does great work. There prices are very reasonable. Geoff is there repairman. He has replaced our salt water chlorinator, 1
Recently moving practically across the street from this location, 1
This is my Husband's favorite spot. It's a bit pricey, 1
This is our go-to liquor store. We were die-hard Lee's people, 1

First Impression:   Being from New York and a frequent patron to my New York pubs I was excited to visit my first Montreal BrewPub on my first night on Holiday in Montreal. I walked in and enjoyed the vibe as I witnessed many patrons on by the bar stools, 1

Absolutely great food! It was Delicious, 1
One of the foods I miss the most in Arkansas is livermush. I know it sounds revolting (it's actually called liver pudding, 1
I would eat here daily if I lived here.  It was incredible.  Try the corn when in season! And BYOM (Bring Your Own Malbec!)  I had the flank steak salad and it was KILLER.  The bacon on my date's BLT was smoked on that magic grill to perfection.  Happiness ensued., 1
I'm writing this review as I am about to embark on another LV journey with the girls.. A bit ago, 1
I searched the Valley for somewhere to cut and highlight my straight blonde hair (which I thought wouldn't be a problem). I had so many terrible experiences. I ended up waiting until I would fly back to my hometown twice a year and have my old hairstylist doing the job.  Then I found Gianna Christine! From the moment I walk in the door I feel relaxed. I am always greeted with a smile and an offer of tea. I never wait To get started on my appointments.  I had gone to Nicole for about a year and loved her. She did such an amazing job when she left I panicked. The staff recommended Steven and he didn't not disappoint. His quiet and kind demeanor allowed me to relax and decompress from a hectic day. He took his time and was truly a joy to sit for. I will always head back to get my blonde from Steven., 1
I love this place. Been there about 20 times and I always get the Dijon chicken or the Californian salad so I can not speak about any other menu items. A little pricey but well worth it., 1
I'd been seeing the sign for this place for a couple of months but thought it was a Seafood Market. Then I drove past it from the Southern Ave. side and realized it was an eatery. It's located in the former Kyoto Bowl location at Country Club and Southern. I stopped in to ask info just as they were closing a couple weeks ago and came back yesterday to try them out.   I found out they had an Oyster Po ' Boy sandwich and ordered it with a side of mac and cheese in place of the fries. A drink even came with the $6.99 price. I really enjoyed the sandwich, 1
Both times I've been here, 1
The best place for frozen yogurt in vegas, 1
Wow!  Good thing I didn't look up the ratings before going there for lunch yesterday.  Otherwise, 1

I love this place. It reminds me of Zaxby's from the South. Simple good food, 1
I usually do business with the W. Indian School Road shop, 1
The atmosphere is great and the coffee is amazing, 1
Great job for their first year open.  The slides were all a blast and if you timed it right the lines weren't bad.  My only advice is to expand the lazy river and make more exits so I can ride to the other side of the park and get out.  I am looking forward to next year!, 1
It was a hard decision to give this place a 4 vs a 5. SG and I are A's fans. This place sells itself during Spring Training as a place to get all your Spring Training shirts and hats and stuff. BUT, 1
I love you.  Fresh, 1
Love this spot! The staff are often very busy as the place is hopping, 1
Stir Krazy!!  Best Mongolian Grill I have ever been to. All the meat and veggies are super fresh, 1
We recently moved to the area and needed a new vet. I used yelp to find this vet and I am glad I did! Dr. K and his staff are wonderful. Dr. K really takes his time with you and makes sure all your questions are answered. We recently kenneled our dogs over Christmas here and I was a bit nervous since it was their first time there. I was pleasantly surprised to receive daily email updates on our dogs..really made me feel more comfortable.  After Christmas we got a new puppy. I was concerned she had an ear infection and called Saturday morning to see if I could get her in. They squeezed her in and Dr. K was again fabulous.. He didn't want me to have to wait all weekend if she had a problem.  I really loved our vet in Wisconsin but am more than pleased with this new clinic! Highly recommend!!!!, 1
Amazing Burgers... Bad Fries  I absolutely love the burgers here. Theyre very juicy, 1
This is the best Sephora location. The ladies who work here are soo helpful. I just love Fatima..she has the best customer service ever! Got my freebie for my Bday..another place you must sign up to the email rewards program. It was eyeshadow/mascara/liner. Mini sized..but free! They know once I get in the store I will buy something. And I did. Splurged on a beautiful Lancome lipstick. Lov it! They always hook me up with free samples to keep me coming back! And I will!, 1
Un.Be.Lievable. Wow. I am almost at a loss for words to describe how amazing this show is.   First off, 1
Quiche the way it should be. And maybe the BEST coffee in town.  So glad to have stumbled onto this place! And now for some French Bread to take home for the family! It was a pleasure!, 1
I love The Liberty!  I heard about it through friends and checked it out on Yelp.  I've only been there once, 1
Best late night pizza on Carson! Drunk eats can't be beat, 1
Just got to see the new Chambers Street section of the museum that's opened up formerly the Royal Museum. Really great, 1

Radio Maria has great and unique food! I went on a date here and absolutely loved it! Every dish is most likely something you would never think of creating but it will be soo good!  The selection of wines is excellent as well!, 1
North Mountain Park has a few different places to park and a number of different trails to hike. Although it is large, 1
C'mon, 1
This place is often overlooked, 1
I've been going to La Famiglia since its first location.    The subs are usually very good but not always consistent.  Sometimes they toast the bread and sometimes they don't.  It gets kind of confusing.    The pizza is always my favorite.  It's probably the closest thing to NY Style pizza that I have found in AZ.    Be ready to wait a little longer than they quote you.  If they tell me 10 minutes it usually more like 20.  Last time I ordered a pizza for take out over the phone.  They told me it would be ready in 25-30 minutes.  I get there after 30 minutes and end up waiting another 25 minutes.  Worst part is they were not busy.  Lucky for them the food is good so I put up with it.  I would love to give them 5 stars but the lack of consistency and slow service cause a star to be lost.  I'm still a fan and will continue to be a regular., 1
Place is amazing!  Try the mango ice tea too!  Really refreshing., 1
Great seafood and an enjoyable atmoshpere! It's always packed and they are still timely with seating, 1
If you are thinking about buying a car but don't like the usual high pressure and shady sales tactics used by a lot of dealerships, 1
We came here for dinner recently.  It was a horrible hot day. So I wanted to go out after being out of town all week. We went in the bar entrance. The bartender sat us in the restaurant, 1
Very fresh and yummy items, 1

Looking for a good pizza joint in Cotswold? Pizza Peel (or is it Pizza n Peel?) is an unpretentious place with great beverage and food specials and an awesome staff.  The pizza is made in a brick oven and personal-sized pizza is around $8-9.  Crispy crust, 1
I am new to the area. And Einstein Bros is not in Cincinnati as far as I know. Before this I have only had it once in DC and liked it. But they have pretzel bagels. And pretzel bagels are my favorite kind. It takes the best of both worlds, 1
been going to the Joint for a year now, 1
One of the things that I don't understand about people is why they wait in line at all of those chain restaurants for crappy food, 1
Date: June 2007 Who: 1 adult Bill: ~$85  I realized that I was subconsciously avoiding all Bobby Flay restaurants up till now. Dunno why, 1
I'm starting with their $3 happy hour. From 3pm - 7pm they spin a wheel every half hour, 1
This is one of my favorite places in Old Town. In fact, 1
The Pacquiao fight tonight means two things:  Mike's making lumpia and we're picking up a baby coconut cake from Diamond Bakery.  The baby coconut is our favorite, 1
Drool... drool... and another drool... just to make my point.  This is by far the BEST buffet in all of Vegas. Seriously!  I'm about half the size of my husband and a fairly light eater, 1
Hours of Operation: 11:00am to 11:00pm Sunday thru Thursday 11:00am to Midnight Friday and Saturday  20 flavors of yogurt and sorbet!  The Red Velvet Cake flavor is fantastic.  About 60 toppings including many fruits, 1
LOVE this restaurant.  We go practically every Saturday and my biggest problem is trying to decide what to have.  We have never had a bad meal.  I am not a fan of veggie burgers and even that was really good.  The new Mac and Cheese is fab.  I had it with mushrooms and bacon.  Terrific atmosphere and all the wait staff is so friendly.  We recommend it to everyone and have taken many people there with us.  Can't say enough about this restaurant., 1
Who knew this was the cool hipster hang out?  Went there on a Friday night during a pseudo reverse happy hour for the Suns game.  We ended up getting five apps to split among four people.  Everything was delicious!  The machaca & cheese flautas were amazing.  We actually got one order then ended up ordering another after tasting them.  The fundido is equally delicious.  If you like guacamole, 1
This McDonalds was a freaking life saver when my girlfriend and I arrived and checked-in to Luxor at 1 AM!  Service at night was suuuper slow... not sure if its all the drunk people ordering that made it slow or they were understaffed, 1
Great beer list.  They make the best old fashioned cocktails.  You have to order one when you eat here.  Fried cheese curds with garlic sauce is the perfect snack when you stop in for drinks.   They are known for their burgers and rightfully so. I love the fried egg on it- even if it can get messy.  Their fries are not my favorite..nothing special., 1
After the VYE at Desert Mission Food Bank, 1
Pretty cool place in Gilbert for breakfast. Fresh ingredients, 1
Great experience. Great shop. Great people. Brandy gave me an awesome blow out, 1
I'm not sure about their dinner but I'm convinced that like their breakfast it's delicious.Me, 1
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. I had the Kalbi burger which is prepared medium and was a good choice.  The parmesan fries were very good.  I would recommend the karage chicken as an appetizer, 1
Love these Potbelly places. This location has a very good crew working together even when busy. Sandwich made perfectly and the store was big and very clean. Will go here again for sure., 1
Phoenix Dent Repair is GREAT place to get your car back to its former glory!  They come to your place at your convenient time.  Jordan came out to take huge dent out of my Accord. He did a great job and very professionally!  Not your typical car guy.  If you have a ding or dent, 1
This is the kind of Vegetarian food that makes me think I could never eat meat again.  Its delicious, 1
I just recently found out they had a location at Norterra and I am so happy I did. I've been coming here for lunch quite a bit lately because I can't get enough of it. I love the Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini. You can't beat getting a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal either. I tried the Rocky Road Brownie last time and I highly recommend it. Everyone who works at this location is always very friendly too. If you're looking for an alternative to Paradise Bakery I'd give Cafe Zupas a try. They don't disappoint., 1
Stuart's review of Mr Hot Potato brought back some dark but recent memories for me. I've been to Mr Hot Potato, 1

Great local bar with good beer and strong drinks.  It will become your home away from home if you frequent it enough.  Try the cheese balls!, 1
Admittedly, 1
A mixed bag review but the four stars is for the excellent service we received from Vine American Kitchen. Saturday evening we had dinner with a group of 10. They gave us a really nice private room to dine. Our server was friendly and took care of everything.    Service = 5 Star Food = 3 Star Decor = 4 Star  Food was a mixed bag. Some entrees were better than others. One thing to note is they don't have a kids menu. Just something to know if you are going with a large family., 1
I LOVE these women! Wow. I have had the pleasure of being treated by different stylist both in NV and CA and this was by far the best experience I've had (outside of my wedding, 1
Finally a place that truly makes their soup from scratch. The  Very Veggie Turkey soup hit the spot.  I ordered the combo with a small Greek Salad. It was Fast, 1
Very nice dining experience.  We had dinner on a Thursday night and started with the small order of the escargot cassoulet, 1
Bigelow Grille's staff was very warm and friendly.  The food was delightful and surpassed my expectation.  My favorite parts of the meal were the starting bread with this amazing chutney dip followed with spicy tomato bisque.  It was a very well balanced and hit the spot!  Their brewed iced tea was also refreshing; especially compared to most brewed teas in the area.  I will most certainly try again in the near future., 1
When CUT first opened in Vegas, 1
Was just introduced to this place... and it is just down the road from my office.  DIGGIN IT!  The food and service were excellent.  I got there at a pretty lively time, 1
Yum.  Have been here a few times, 1
Love the provolone philly but sometimes I get adventurous and try different sandwiches, 1
Sooooooo yummy, 1
Nicki was one of my favorite vendors for our wedding! She is really laid back and fun to work with but she definitely knows what she is doing! Her customer service is excellent and she works with your ideas and tries to help in anyway possible.  We had a fairly large wedding, 1
Wildfish delivered on an extremely happy 'happy hour' tonight to this girl...  The Wildfish chopped salad may be a new favorite - it has huge chilled fresh shrimp, 1
A great thrift store.  I discovered a lot of neat treasures here including a small collection of interesting T-shirts, 1
This has got to be one of the best gyms on a military base....ever!  If you've ever paid $$ for off base gyms and been to a Lifetime fitness, 1
I was at least 10 times is one of the best in Vegas. The variety of  the food is very big and always everything  is  fresh, 1
OMG!!! A Ninety-Nine Cent Only store that's NOT in a ghetto, 1
I really enjoyed my trip to this store today. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I cannot wait to go back and get more of a look when my husband has the children :) There were a lot of different yarns and patterns. I was also really interested in their button collection. Overall - great store and service. Support local business., 1
Homemade tortillas are sooo good. Get the fundido, 1
The White Hart Inn offers everything for the traditional pub lover. They serve traditional drinks including a very good variety of single malts and plenty choice of beers and ales including the local Caledonian Brewery ales. The staff are also very friendly.   My flatmates and I stumbled in here during a Grassmarket pub crawl (expensive!)  and were ecstatic to hear live scottish country music being performed. This, 1
This place is amazing! Best breakfast I have ever had. I don't usually write reviews but this is well deserved. They cook everything to order so you have to waiting a little longer but it's totally worth the wait. I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Twice. It was that good. I recommend that you share. The portions are huge and there is more than enough for two. My husband had the meatloaf hash. It was by far the best meatloaf either one of us had ever had. I would order it and I don't ever eat meatloaf. The prices are great. Hash House A Go Go is definitely one of the cheapest places we ate at our stay in Vegas. I would go again and again and again. The service was good the food is great! I completely recommend!, 1
Took the family for lunch as a Christmas treat. Service was good, 1
Kristin S has always raved about this place as being an amazing happy hour spot, 1
Stopped in for a late lunch during the week. It was a slow time of day and pretty empty. We seated ourselves and were promptly brought menus. Our server was very pleasant and answered our questions about the menu.  We ordered the antipasto salad and sampler plate. Both were delicious! Portion sizes were generous! It's clean inside with a nice size menu.  Will definitely be back to try other dishes!, 1
Downstairs bar is an absolute favorite.  Great small plates and even better service.  I love their stemware. :), 1
Went with the Original and the Caribbean jerk.  Listen to the Yelpers on this one.  Go with the Original and you should not be disappointed.  This place is great for two reasons.  It is open 24 hours a day, 1
OMG! I never had a BLT so good! This was really the "Best BLT". Pricing was decent and in one of the best Hotel/Casinos too!, 1
Awesome brunch spot. Super cute decor! Hey you can't go wrong with bottomless mimosa and sangria for brunch! The food is cheap and pretty good! Ladies this is the place to get your girls together for drinks and convo! #SexandCityVibe, 1
Excellent Service! Rarely do I have a memorable experience grabbing something quick and going through the drivethru but Eden was inviting and very friendly. I apologize for not recalling his name but the gentleman at the second window was awesome too.  Tenders were fresh and the bleu cheese sauce was on point. Tried the blueberry coleslaw which was awesome and refreshing on a hot day.  Definitely have a limited menu but as they say, 1
Everyone was extremely friendly to me and my pup. His haircut came out great! Highly recommend this place!, 1
I have been to Taste of Tops about a half dozen times because it is a pretty neat place and close to my house.  My wife and I went last night (Wednesday) with some friends at about 6pm and the place was pretty crowded.  I really don't like the place when it is crowded.  Thankfully the 2 couches they have were empty because I strongly prefer having a drink on a couch rather than at a regular table or on a bar stool.  Anyway, 1
Absolutely delicious.  Authentic Thai food from different regions of Thailand. My only regret is that I didn't get to try more dishes!   1. Opened at 11am on Monday  2. BBQ chicken was moist and flavorful! 3. Red curry, 1
So I heard from the world that In N Out is the best burger.....I knew it wasn't before I ever went. That honor belongs to Aussie Burger in Greenville, 1
A tad bit pricey but the poke is good..., 1
OMG!  After months of driving past Cafe Rio without stopping, 1
So far I've only used their tanning services and and happy with everything but the wait time. They could use some more beds in there.  I'm wondering if anyone has used their teeth whitening services and what you thought. Was it worth the money?, 1
I just got back from another amazing two night stay at MOLV. I had to add another star this time for several reasons. The prices, 1
Eggs Benedict was great, 1
Some of the bloom has fallen off the rose for me when it comes to this place.  I'm still a fan, 1
Good za!!' Apart from the franchise pizza this is a better alternative.  The wings are great too, 1
Came in for happy hour on Monday. I've brought clients here for dinner in the past and really miss the Cigar bar in the back!  Ordered the burger and a beer. The burger was thick and tasty although I felt the bun is overly thick. The condiments were fresh and the potatoes that came with the burger were on the greasy side. I ended up half way through the burger and chucked half the bun and finished the burger with a fork and knife.  The bar has cougars and one was chatting my ear off. Don't get me wrong I like socializing but she was a distraction!  Stick with the steaks, 1
Was here multiple times and had a great experience, 1
Cat got neutered. Was some confusion on the appointment - they wanted me to have a carrier and I didn't have one. So I dropped the cat off and went and got one, 1
I just discovered this restaurant off of 27th Street and Broadway, 1
I was pretty impressed with this place. Nice atmosphere, 1
If you are looking for someplace to go in the south hills of Pittsburgh i would definitely recommend Someone Else's Bar.  The drink selection is good, 1
3.5 rounded up.  I'm always satisfied when I come here, 1
The owners were very nice. Nice group of ladies and gentlemen working there.   We had a great time meeting people. The decor is lovely! We all loved it. We will be back!  Ps They have security people which is awesome if you go by yourself to the bar., 1
Like Gibson, 1
Being a first timer here, 1
I have now been to El Rico's several times and thought it was time to give it a review. I went last night with a small group, 1
We chose this place because the patio atmosphere was good and they had space on a busy Sunday afternoon. We went for a pitcher of sangria, 1
A great attraction just down a bit from the covered portion of Freemont St.  Certainly a bit of a "hipster" vibe too it with many random shops of eclectic nature more targeted for the ladies.  Several decent dining options around the outsides, 1
I really don't understand all the bad reviews- if you don't want to wait in line or have to say no to a sales pitch take a taxi. I rented a car from here last week for my vacation. We were helped by a woman who I believe was named Murna. She was very helpful and we even chatted about all the bad reviews on here. You get what you pay for- this place has the cheapest cars so expect to wait in line. There was no high pressure sales pitch- they outlined the offers and I responded with a firm no and that was that., 1
Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is like falling down the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, 1
New favorite smoothie spot! I wish I lived nearby so I can try different flavors everyday but I don't care how far, 1
I really liked this place! staff was nice and the crowd is pretty cool. Mainly university students.  There are 3 floors; Main floor has live music. Downstairs is pretty small but upstairs is pretty big, 1
This is the second time we have stayed here. The huge size of the suite as well as the huge pool and spas are great. No complaints at all except that since the pool Is open until midnight there were 2 nights of people who came back to the hotel drunk and were standing around the spa shouting and yelling and throwing a football around until about 12:30am. The laundry machines are a bit slow but they are free so how can you complain? Breakfast was ok but very very salty on the eggs and sausages. Other than that it was all wonderful., 1
Finally! A truly guilt free place to eat for me and my daughter after hitting the gym.  I had a delicious ground turkey bowl. The turkey was moist and flavorful with lots of veggies, 1
I'm not from Arizona. Our family was driving through and wanted an Asian restaurant that wasn't too far off the freeway.   We all agreed this was the best mini detour we've ever taken.  The place is very small and looks a bit dirty, 1
Prices are reasonable...fried rice, 1
Best airline. I LOVE SOUTHWEST., 1
We stayed one night in the Paris hotel. A lost stop on our way home to Ca. My daughter loves Paris and thought it would be nice and fun for her. She loved the decor of lobby, 1
With tons of modern casinos and hotels on the strip, 1
We had our reunion just this past week and this was one of the places that I was soooo curious about by reading all the praises about it..  When we stepped through the door of windmill address restaurant, 1
excellent sushi offerings, 1
Great service. Good beer. Good food and apps. What more could you ask for. It's so fun to people watch here on the weekends as a local. You get a lot of large girl group parties, 1
Mark's is consistently one of the best restaurants I've eaten at.  I am a semi-regular.  It's pretty simple: If you like eggs benedict this is the place.  My personal favorite is the Irish Eggs Benedict - which is basically corned beef hash re-imagined as a benny.  The fritattas are also fantastic. The strawberry preserves on the table is a nice touch also. Breakfast for two is around 20 bucks.  Support a local business, 1
Okay this was probably the wrong way to go for trying a new place, 1
We had the Mums classic and the eggs Benedict. Both were good. The portion size was not too large. The service was fast and friendly. There were plenty of tables on a Sunday morning. No wifi. The waiter also helped us with recommendations for bars for later in the evening., 1
We hired Taqueria Guadalajara for a grad party yesterday. I read the reviews before hiring them but was a little nervous because reservation was made online rather than person to person. I did call Friday to confirm and the gentleman I spoke with knew exactly who I was and the time of my event. The mother- daughter pair (Blancas) arrived  on time and ready to go! The set up was incredible and the food was fabulous. THeir salsa and condiment bar was the best I have seen- so many salsas and vegies. The ladies were friendly and professional and our 50 guests were all impressed. We have many family functions and parties at our house and I would say that this was in the top three for parties. Couldn't have asked for anything more. I will look for a reason to use them again because it was so good., 1
My pops is a Corona fan, 1
Hands down the best poke shop we've been to. The owner is so nice. We bought 1/4 of 5 different items to try. Everything was great. We especially liked the salmon furikake. Went next door to 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plates to get some rice and eat there., 1
I'm a fan of this place. It offers true small coffee house experience.  Not many places offer Real Iced Coffee. This place offers something similar very close. They cold brew their coffee grounds in room temperature water (instead of iced or chilled water) and then serve it under the name of Iced Toddy. It's not bad. The pastries they serve are from a third party and is acceptable.  I had: Iced Toddy (no sugar, 1
Came here for brunch on Sunday and stayed for the dinner. We paid $29.95 for the combined all you can drink champagne special, 1
Vegas baby.....vegas.....  It's an airport. See all my other airport reviews. They are all about the same...sometimes on time, 1
A friend of mine works nearby and said that they recently opened a "Caf\u00e9" at their location and that we should go there for lunch. I went and it was great. Their sandwiches use their bread, 1
Checked out Province last night and had a great experience. The inside of the restaurant is very nice if maybe a little cold design wise. There were 3-4 other tables of people so it felt pretty empty which didn't help but Im sure that will change as the restaurant becomes more known. We were seated pretty close to the entrance and could see there was a pretty constant stream of hotel guests coming in with their luggages which I liked.   The service was outstanding. The waitress did just the right amount of checking in with us throughout the night and was very prompt when needed. The chef sent out two appetizers on the house, 1
As always the food was awesome.  Got the Palace Pan roast with linguine (instead of rice) and it was delicious.  Very big portions.   Didn't care for the long wait but that's our fault for going during prime lunch hours. Avoid going between 11 and 2 if possible. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town., 1
Had a boat ride it was sooooooo romantic I'm really shy so didn't like, 1
This place is a hidden gem. I used to work near the other location (near Metro Center) and ate there all the time. I was delighted to find another location closer to where I'm working now. Great place for lunch or take-away after work. The chips and salsa are possibly the best anywhere. The salsa is clearly fresh-made and it ROCKS.   I swear they don't make anything until you order it. My favorite is the fajita burrito with chicken. The veggies are fresh-grilled and always have just the right texture, 1
We've visited Avanti's many times.  We enjoy the ambiance with many different seating "areas" throughout the space.  Some by windows and some deeper into the space with darker lighting.  The atmosphere is casual and we have no concerns about wearing shorts and t-shirt there while dining.  All of our meals have been very good and we have enjoyed a glass of wine each time.  We have had the spaghetti and meatballs, 1
One of my favorite buffets in Vegas. This is a must if you have not tried already. It is a little pricey but way worth it. Crab legs always is bomb. You can actually wait in line to steam the crab legs but i like them fresh or steamed. They also have oyster shots which is amazing. I recently found the best mushroom risotto. It is by the pizza section of the buffet. Another amazing food that is a must try is by the sushi section. It is in a little plate with spicy tuna. It is just heaven in your mouth. The dessert is good as well. The gelato is amazing., 1
This is great! I've never had so much fun! We rented tubes and made sure to bring sheets to cover the tubes (so you don't burn because they are black) or bring your own light colored tubes). We also brought coolers with food and drinks (you can bring beer, 1
Beckett's Table is one of my most favorite places.  I recommend it to anyone looking for simply great food!  The service is right on point and the food is so comforting, 1
One of my favorite places to go in the city, 1
Best market I have been to, 1
My folks have been bringing me to Crazy Jim's since I was a kid and we still agree that it is the best Greek Food in town. The Gyro meat here is to die for. Get the Gyro Picado and you will love life! The menu is awesome across the board, 1
I joined some friends at Steiner's for a hockey game and the staff was great! I was surprised they carried Lindemans Framboise and that earned them their 4 stars. The food was great, 1
Had a slice of pepperoni, 1
Are you kidding me-1 dozen donut holes for $1!!! Who says you can't get anything for a buck.  Everyone has pretty much nailed it with the donuts & the pics tell the rest. Good stuff., 1
We had the California Omelet and the Spinach Omelet along with home fries and hash browns and couldn't help but appreciate the freshness and great taste of the whole meal.  The staff is responsive and their customer service was very much appreciated.  This definitely beats the long lines at IHOP, 1
I don't own any pets, 1
Their fruity tropical drinks are incredibly delicious!! Some are really boozey and others not so much. The patio out back is a lovely place to spend a summer evening (although the uneven ground makes for a wobbly experience at times - or maybe that was just the drinks). They don't take cards which is pretty unfortunate for a place in their price range., 1
We went for Adults' Night Out. They have it every First Friday from 5:30-9. It's free and there are no kids. Woo hoo! It was fun getting to play with everything without having to be the nice mature adult and let the kids at it first. Unfortunately, 1
I have been using this vet for 15 years +.. The quality of service they offer is immeasurable.  They are personable and the staff is so accomidating.  There are no buts with them just great service. Honesty and integrity are never in question. This can be tricky with other vets because in this profession they know we love our animals.. I've heard horror stories and luckily don't have one to tell.. Dr. Wilson and Dr. V are both awesome! My doggies are always in good hands with them!, 1
Ok so my last 2 -3 trips to YH were lackluster, 1

Recently my first visit and it was awesome.  The food was very tasty and fresh.  the service was great and I will be back.  I had the Cobb Salad and some Mussels and they were great.  Thanks for a great experience, 1
Service was ok, 1
Until I moved to the west side of town, 1
This place is fantastic! Stopped here with my kiddos to try something new. We ordered a Strawberry and a Black Sesame. The kids and I loved our choices. The strawberry was mounded high and topped with fresh chopped strawberries and condensed milk. The black sesame came with condensed milk and mochi. My black sesame was so unique, 1
Went for the first time on a Sunday and enjoyed my lat\u00e9 and cinnamon roll with my wife. Unfortunately the place is very popular and crowded and the typical hipster vibe is there, 1
Slushy booze. Need I say anything else?  Hint--bring your expensive mug from your last visit for a cheaper 'refill.', 1
The best pizza in Pittsburgh, 1
We gave this place a try in place of our regular restaurant for breakfast: Hash House A Go Go. Its a great hole in the wall. Very friendly staff and the food is fantastic., 1
Super Chill environment with great variety of sandwiches. Love their Kool Aid dispensers, 1
Dropped into JoBot Coffee several weeks ago with a friend and was pleasantly surprised to find they are located in a historic phoenix home converted into a coffee bar. The barista's were courteous and attentive and they serve a great Americano. Yeah, 1
Super friendly staff. The guy at the counter gave me a sample of the green Chile which was fantastic. The chips took a minute to come out because they were literally frying fresh tortilla chips. Fantastic food and really good personable service. Authentic dishes like birria and lengua and food to satisfy the gringo like carne asada. Go there!, 1
I needed to get the mud off my truck after the storm. Mud inside and out. Stopped going here 3 yrs ago because of horrible attitudes and service.  Had no choice. What a nice surprise! Really nice people and I was pleased at the results.  I even brought my other car in on Wednesday. Again pleased with the results., 1
Got an overlay (acrylic over my nails, 1
Never thought id like Coffeebean because im picky when it comes to coffee. Starbucks or Kona was it. i love their caramel hot latte and caramel ice blended. Price is less and also great taste and most of all, 1
@RedVelvetLV  is one of my #FabFav restaurants to eat at in Las Vegas!  Service  is extraordinary and they have delicious foods that can be prepared vegan/vegetarian styled upon request! My favorite is the tuna melt (vegan) yum-yum! #MustTry @LasVegas_Places, 1
Great seafood!  Service from one server, 1
I have lived down the street from this place for almost a year, 1
How have I not written a review for one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix yet? Bad Rachel! Tuck Shop is a great spot, 1
Small local Pho restaurant. Better than others from a food and ambiance standpoint. Don't know if I'd drive across town for this place but I live nearby and I will most certainly be back. The sprig rolls there are much better than most other similar establishments I have been to. The sauces were also much more flavorful too. Our server was good too a young lady with tattoos and a bold personality., 1
I'm only reviewing the Fireside Lounge today as all I did was drink here. It's a very fun place to hang with friends. Red and Purple lights, 1
nothing beats a pint of guinness double poured, 1
Amidst the over-priced sit down restaurants that prevail Myers Park and Eastover is a little slice of heaven in Providence Road Sundries.  Yeah, 1
I came here with my family it was real authentic meddle eastern food great food and great service i will highly recommend its little bit pricey but worth it, 1
I really enjoy this place! Every time I come here I get great service and my food is AWESOME! Keep it up!, 1
Great Paht Thai! And I'm very picky about my paht thai. Also I loved the thai iced tea and the fact that they have lunch specials on the weekend that comes with soup and an egg roll. The tohm yahm soup was VERY delicious!, 1
Was on my way to see my sister at the after having surgery she was getting home from the hospital. Ran into Olive Garden to get some take out.   Josh was more than helpful and was able to get our food ready and out the door in less than 20 minutes.  This was during one of their busiest time.  Josh thank you for being so prompt and had such a smile on his face.  Well Done!!, 1
Dry rub ribs were awesome. Great smoke, 1
I've played adult indoor soccer at almost every indoor park in Las Vegas and currently play at bld and longevity.   By far longevity is my fav.  The staff is awesome, 1
Takara is one of the few Japanese restaurants in Montreal operated by a Japanese chef. I've heard that he goes to the fish market and buys his seafood himself.   The first important thing to note about Takara is its location. The entrance is on the 4th floor eventhough they have a sign near the entrance on Peel.  The Japanese speaking hostess gave us one of the private rooms where you have to take off your shoes and sit with your legs in a hole. It makes it appear you are sitting on a tatami but it is wayyyyy more comfortable.  The sushi is well presented and as fresh as you can get in Montreal. Taste is also authentic. We ordered some fried tofu, 1
So this past summer as I am waiting to get a seat at Burger Bar, 1
Very impressed with Rebel Pools. Jason is easy to get a hold of and does a great job for my rental house in North LV. Although I live out of state, 1
This makes my second time to India Oven and I am hooked!! This is without a doubt the best Food ever. To the soft hot fresh garlic naan that comes table direct from the oven to the desserts it is all delicious.  For a buffet it is sit down high quality food only you can pick and choose what you want.   The service is better than most and they are very attentive and polite. Not a fancy place but not a dive either. It is the best of both worlds combined into a very casual eating environment that makes it a pleasure to come back too over and over again., 1
Great staff!  They are very helpful and made the whole process very enjoyable.  Very knowledgeable staff and extremely excited about diving., 1
Steak TarTar is so good! I'm talking "Christmas party in my mouth" good! Quail Egg on top, 1
We came here for dinner Friday night during happy hour.  We sat outside on the patio and it was a beautiful night out so that helped with the overall ambiance.  The HH wine was excellent. They gave huge pours and it was only $6 a glass. My husband had a HH shrimp dish which he liked.  We split a Filet with vegetables, 1
They claim to be the very first drive thru, 1
Bite after bite was orgasmic!!! I ordered a filet mignon special and it was amazing. This is a great restaurant, 1
I drove over 600 miles from Nor Cal on the advice of a friend - and would do it again  Great work, 1
Excellent lunch value!  I went with the Sashimi ($8.50 Lunch): which includes rice, 1
Where to begin???  This place is awesome!  It is visually stunning and maintained. The service was first class an dozes of opulence.     It is in the middle of paradise valley set at the base of the mountain. Sitting at the bar you would have no idea you were in the middle of Phoenix.   As the birds chirped and the breeze blew on a perfect 80 degree day in the valley of the sun I couldn't believe I was sitting in complete relaxation.   There was a wedding that was going on at the same time as the event we were at. Plenty of room with no idea several things were happening at the same time.  I will certainly come back for a well deserved staycation., 1
This review is for the dog park only and it's our favorite place for our puppy because it's spacious and clean (for the most part). There are three fenced in grassy areas for dogs: for big dogs, 1
This is a great small restaurant. While it doesn't have a lot of seating that is not important to me since I always take home my food. The rolls are always fresh.  I call ahead my orders and they are pretty accurate in their wait times. On Wednesday the wait times are usually long which I assume is due to the roll special. That is the day I most often go to take advantage. I have had the chicken dinner before and it was good as well., 1
Can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The Oatmeal our way is magical, 1
Great breke - standard fare, 1
Another brilliant shopping experience at the Ivy. Today it was a stunning pair of Cole-Hahn kitten heels in a pale mauve - the pink of spring- for......  Wait for it....$20! I take my shopping very seriously and you could say that the Ivy is my altar of bargain shopping. I always find something to add to my wardrobe that makes me look fabulous and sets me apart from everyone else. I love the experience here and that has a lot to do with the owners and the great care they take of their merchandise and store. Whenever I go in, 1
Hidden gem near the hospital on McDowell and 12th street. Don't let the small size fool you, 1
Delicious crepes! I love that they're obviously just a little independent group - I get a crepe almost every Sunday at the Farmer's Market. It can be a bit of a wait but worth it!, 1
Encore beach club (EBC) is currently my favorite pool party in all of Las Vegas. I say this as someone who has been going to pool parties since Rehab pioneered them 5 or so years ago.   The music is the main reason, 1
Definitely recommend this salon! I booked an appointment after having many failed attempts with other stylist that are not able to work with biracial hair. I was frustrated and tired of having the same look because of my unruly mop. I have thick, 1
this my very first show in vegas that i went to see, 1
Excellent sandwiches for a great price. I had Chris' Special with cole slaw. The sandwich tasted fresh and the cole slaw was crispy. You can't ask for much more for $6., 1
Sunday Brunch was perfect!!! Cold Buffet with warm individual orders that were the perfect size to order 3 or 4. Coffee was excellent as was the service. Our Server, 1
Nous cherchions un petit restaurant ou s'arr\u00eater un peu plus loin que les grand casinos, 1
Paul's show is amazing!  I've taken many friends and business colleagues to see him perform. All of them were highly impressed!  Mr. Vigil is a master at his craft. Thank you Paul for many wonderful memories!, 1

Opened in 2014, 1
This place ROCKS.  Found it through Groupon and even though we didn't buy the actual Groupon, 1
The gyros are pretty good, 1
A go to place in my book to get some work done. The location on Ellsworth has comfy chairs and a nice number of outlets for those who have a laptop. Crazy Mocha on Ellsworth offers some great coffee and tea choices along with some baked goods, 1
Excellent food and service. House made coconut ice cream is to die for. Highly recommend spicy beef salad!, 1
BBQ Done right, 1
Get the Local Access card if you are a Vegas local!  Why you ask?  So you can get Happy Hour discount all the time!!!  No more complaints about having your work schedule changed, 1
I'm usually not particular as to where I get my haircut, 1
Cool indoor mini-golf. I thought the 8 dollar fee was a fair price for the time you're able to spend here. The fluorescent lighting was a neat trick and I really thought the animal/safari theme was nice. Great place for kids, 1
The food is damn good. I've been coming to this restaurant for years. I love thAt Kung pao chicken., 1
Pros: Really good burgers great flavors. Really good shakes. Ok fries. Local produce, 1
Dined on a Friday night during happy happy hour. They have a well priced limited menu that includes food and drinks. The resturant offers shaded cool patio space or resturant seating. The resturant seating had live music. My guest and I sat on the patio. We had to wait 15mins before someone asked us what we wanted to drink. This resturant does not have the 2 min rule like most resturants do for a server to greet you. The surrounding tables had the same experience. The resturant was not to busy just not enough servers.  The menu is limited but has a great variety of options to choose from for all dietary needs. I am not a beer drinker but my guest who joined me was VERY impressed by all the different brands. I ordered the Sasuage, 1
What an interesting place.  old school video game machines, 1
I trust this company with my business accounting. Service is always quick and friendly., 1
I Can't believe this place had a bad review!  This has to be my new favorite place to get botox! I have been getting botox for years, 1
You're in the vicinity of Black Canyon City. Your pickings are (or at least appear to be) slim. Do you stop at Rock Springs Cafe?  Yes, 1
After finding out that LaGasse Stadium is now closed to under 21, 1
Un superbe endroit pour les p\u00e2tisseries asiatiques! Elles ont toutes l'air tr\u00e8s fra\u00eeches et du jour, 1
Love Don Pedro's the food is great, 1
I LOVE Plaza De Anaya!!! Kimberly (the owner) is so sweet...Every time I've walked in that door, 1
We've been going since day 1, 1
Decide to drop by at Chinita for lunch and I am glad I did. The food was deliciousI had mango margarita and Chinita sampler and ?Camarines al mojo de ajo and it was a great choice, 1
I don't live down the street from Eyecare Plus anymore, 1
I've been frequenting Michaels lately because I thought I would get crafty for Christmas and make most of my gifts! I started making jewelery for friends and family . They have a big selection of beads here. There is usually a mailer that gives me additional discounts on regularly priced items but it's hard to find something regular price. Every time I come in everything is on sale! I'm not complaining though.   The staff is also very helpful. The last time I cam here I had two people helping me until I  found what I needed. They also gave me helpful tips on how to secure crimping beads better. I love the fact that when you ask them for help they go the extra mile to make your project a success!, 1
This is THE place for gifts for the girl in your life with unique taste.  You're guaranteed to find something that can't be picked up just anywhere, 1
Purchased Lion King & Titanic Exhibit tickets for the family (6 adults).  Prices for Lion King were not significantly cheaper but service was helpful and accomodating. We found it difficult to find seats together because Tix for Tonight only sell certain sections and sometimes they seats are all spread out.  We woke up early the morning of and got there right as the ticket window opened as suggested by other Yelpers and by about 10:30 am there was a line out the door (thanks for the tip!). As for location the Fashion Square location was easy to find.  Luxor tickets were a couple bucks below what Luxor sold them for so that was cool. I would highly recommend this exhibit. They did such a good job. Not boring at all!, 1
overall a great place for a few hours for drinks, 1
I always have a fatal attraction with a handsome stranger when I visit Vegas. Our eyes meet from a distance. Because I'm always a little too nervous to approach him, 1
Ginger-Ale with ginger juice, 1
Excellent lunch!!!!!! Great value! Great wine! Great atmosphere!  The only negative, 1
Had the random urge to try Caribbean food. Googled and found this gem down the street from me! Went at 4pm, 1
I love this place! I found out about  this place from a friend and cant stop going! The cucumber salad is so delicious and i cant find it anywhere else. They have all sorts of yummy rolls:) My personal favorite is the Crazy roll and the Forrest Gump roll., 1
I am a fan of Mexican food and I love Chavelas.  I've been searching for a Mexican restaurant that makes these in Vegas.  I was apprehensive when the waiter asked me how this drink is made... then excited when he said they could make it... then slightly disappointed again when they brought the drink to the table.  Not what I am looking for.  But things improved as the food came to the table.    I had the pork tamales and Chiliquiles.  Both were above average and the homemade tortillas were outstanding.  Chips and salsa were very basic but had a good flavor., 1
The service was extraordinary!  ESPECIALLY for Vegas, 1
I've lost count as to how many times I've been back to MSD... let's just say an intervention may be in my future.  Suffice it to say that I think this place is simply superb.   + The bread speaks for itself. It's all amazing.  + The breakfast food is amongst the best in town. Their omelettes are fluffy, 1
This was a really pleasant surprise.  The normal Friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady's particular tastes.  She was going to be nice enough to go to "Dish" although I know it's not one of her favs'.  Mantini's also came across the radar screen.  However, 1
Just went here for lunch.  overall probably should get 3 stars, 1
Located in Homewood, 1
Wife and I went to Ruth's Chris tonight.  They offer valet which is great cause the Tryon St. location is often hard to get a street level spot.  The prices are typical for an uptown steak house (that mean's $20 pp more than they should be by the end of the meal).  I skipped an appetizer but the wife had fried zucchini sticks.  They were solid.  I had a filet with 3 blackened shrimp on it.  The nice combo of the butter and the shrimp/steak was awesome.  She had salmon (I don't eat fish)  For dessert we shared the cheesecake.  they serve individual cakes instead of slices so you get a nice crust all around  would have given it a 5/5 just don't like a 3 digit bill for 2 people for dinner, 1
The T-C-T Toasted Cheeses Torte with green chills was awesome.   We have been going to Macayo's for five decades and the salsa and T-C-T's have been a favorite for years.  The rest of menu is real Amiercannized, 1
This place was recommended by one of my coworkers.  I have to say they have THE best Adobo Fried Rice Omelet (a.k.a. Adobo Burrito) ever! Our first time there, 1
The short: Pink Spot's ice cream has my favorite texture--dense, 1
UPDATE: Ach du lieber! The other day, 1
Positives:  Right in the heart of everything.  Negs:  Right in the heart of everything.  Clean enough and a bit dated but who goes to Madison to stay in the room? (although I don't want to think about the history of the towels I used).  So if drinking and partying and drinking more and listening to other people outside doing the same is what you are looking for... this room is great especially when you consider you will be blacked out within a few hours of check in., 1
I left this place truly amazed food was amazing however does dig far into your wallet staff was excellent and my only complaint was that I wanted to thank the chef personally but she was to busy to come out., 1
I haven't seen a show in Vegas in awhile.  Came here this past week to celebrate my bf birthday and he wanted to see Santana, 1
I will start this by saying while I am a artist, 1
Love the level of service here and the prices aren't highway robbery. I drive out of my way to go to this place! Love the hot wax and sugar pedi's!, 1
Prosciutto e mela pizza was delicious! Danielle was are server...super friendly., 1
We just moved here from Seattle. We tried Floyd's after reading the reviews. It was small with a friendly and attentive staff. We tried to go a second night, 1
Just saw "Death of a Salesman" and it was very good. The theatre is small but very nice. I thought they did an excellent job with casting and the sets. Great job by the lighting crew as well. I was actually late, 1
So..... Yea, 1
I don't often give five stars but Paletas Betty is a wonderful addition to the Mill avenue experience - fresh Latin American frozen treats on a stick made with fresh fruits and nuts and spices, 1
We had supper on the terrace on a Tuesday evening.  The terrace is lovely and the weather was beautiful!  Our waiter was helpful and attentive.  We had the seafood platter for two, 1
My experiences here have been great! The business is owned and ran by a lovely couple. They take their time and give great service. They don't dilute their polish, 1
Freaky great casual atmosphere!  And don't miss the bakery next door. Great outdoor and indoor seating, 1
Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. They offer such great services to the valley, 1
There aren't enough stars in this rating scale to give John and Dalisa of Altf an accurate review.  I fell in love with their work when they shot the weddings of two of my best friends.  When I got engaged and started planning my wedding, 1
Oh my bursting buttons !  The food is all first rate, 1
Two words: White Rabbit  Yes the nectar of the drunken gods, 1
It's hard to find fresh good veggie friendly food. Simply put YUMMY!, 1
I would come here for brunchfor their unlimited mimosas, 1
I moved here and by luck found them and have been very satisfied and pleased with their services. I use the dry cleaners at least once a week and they are terrific. It is wonderful to see a family run business that offers great customer service and are very friendly!, 1
I've been going to Depont Salon and Spa since it opened. I live in N. Phoenix, 1
Good beer and good burgers.  What else do I need to say?  But really though, 1
Second tripwas better than the first.  Taco's are worth the trip., 1

Me and my friends like to go there. The cooks are always fun, 1
After waiting for so long to go to Brian's Beach, 1
FANTASTIC !!!  We ate here last Friday for my husband's birthday.  Since we wanted to try different things, 1
can  I just say that I missssssssss this place!  Moving to Chicago has made me give us the best places i.e. this nail salon....  they tend to me and took care of my feet that I get very lazy to do on my own time.   oh dynasty, 1
Spencer the barber is great - I highly recommend the shave!!, 1
Awesome food and service is even better. When manuel is our server We really enjoy our meals., 1
Unassuming location/decor, 1
The food was absolutely excellent. This is a true Italian restaurant with a great European feel. Wasn't the fastest service but they just opened.  The owners/staff are friendly and welcoming.   Just go, 1
Left Burger bar after too big a tab for just 2 beers and came here. This place is awesome. They have a great happy hour, 1
-found the hotel on Priceline.  When I called the hotel to see if I could book a room directly from them, 1
My sister brought me to the Food Truck Friday event while I was in town.  The Herban Legend was the first truck I saw and the menu had me drooling so of course I stopped here.  They were having a mac and cheese special that night with bacon and black pepper (I think there was roasted garlic as well, 1
Showed up to this place for lunch around 1:30 to find a huge line we had to wait in before even getting in this place.  Yes, 1
The best sandwiches in the city? It might be too early to give them the title since I've only been once. But, 1
I love love love Trader Joe's Our typical trip:  TONS of produce at great prices, 1
YUMMMMMMY!!!! We came here before the KA show and I LOVED IT!!! I had the cucumber martini (super refreshing!) and the rib ravioli. OMG the ravioli was deliciousness!!! He had the gnocchi and it was just okay. Our server was attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. We were in a bit of a rush so we literally just ate and ran. From the 45 minutes we were there, 1
I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet.  For appetizer I had the fury chicken wings. I loved the little blue cheese bits that were sprinkled over the wings. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger as my main meal with a side of truffle Parmesan fries. Ugh, 1
This place kicks ass! There are a lot of hidden gems throughout Las Vegas that serve great food off-the-strip. This is one of my favorites.  Although it's AYCE, 1
Food was so good & service was friendly and great. The pork taco was super delicious. Nice tequila selection as well!!, 1
Being a native New Yorker it has been hard to find a good quaint pizza spot. I have finally found 1 in Frankies. Fantastic sauce along with superior dough make for a delicious slice. Also you cant beat the service and price. Well done Frankie's., 1
Get their version of potato skins - yum, 1

Lux is like being taught physics by Sir Isaac Newton., 1
Amazingly great food. Owner is super nice and friendly. Good prices and very clean inside and out. Taste flavor everything absolutely amazing. First time here found my new home for pizza definitely won't go anywhere else now. If your ever in Gilbert Arizona don't pass up this place without stopping in and grabbing something to eat. Thanks for the great food experience and service., 1
I took my family out for dinner and wanted to try something new. This was an important dinner so it had to be somewhere good. The glowing reviews brought us here. We had to wait for a few minutes for a table which was bearable thanks to all their flat screen TV's with the OKC game on.  Pork Belly Buns: Braised pork belly with sauce, 1
This company is the bomb. One of the most creative and efficient  artists I have worked with. Amanda whips out amazing work faster than I have ever seen while still giving you that special quality experience. She has true vision as an artist and is so much fun to work with. I recommend her for any and all events you may have coming up., 1
Great small pizza place love their crust. Makes sense that that's what their  best at. Love their Launch slice special. 4.95 for 2 slices and a drink. Greatfriendly staff. It truly is a one stop place for italian cuisine., 1
Defalco's is amazingly delicious. The trick to getting your lunch in a timely fashion is to call ahead. It's usually ready in about fifteen minutes and you get to skip the line (as pickups are a separate cashier).  The cheesesteaks are phenomenally sinful, 1
super cheap beer and deep fried pretzels. what else do you need?, 1
Holey rusted metal Batman!! I thought I'd never see another one of these unless I went back to Hawaii. This place - literally - has everything. You can get any kitschy little gift you need to get. You can only get there by wandering Fremont Street., 1
Dr Roach is amazing!  He is thoughtful, 1
My daughter called to tell me her car will turn over but won't start at 4:30pm on a Friday. Problem, 1
I like the food and the staff was friendly. I have to say I like the food at  Yannis better but for the proce and the variety of the menu you cant beat it!!!, 1
Excellent steaks in a modern upscale atmosphere. Don't let it turn you off that it's located in a mall - it has it's own entrance from the parking lot. They have several different seating types from lounge couches to a full bar. Great spot for a group., 1
Stayed at the MC before but have never tried The Pub before. I was impressed, 1
Great service...quality food....family friendly atmosphere.:), 1
JetBlue is awesome. When you party in vegas and need to go home, 1
Super fresh and yummy food.  Loved the decor, 1
This is the best Asian Buffet by far.  They even have prime rib and crab legs on the weekend.  My only complaint, 1
The yuzu sauces are to die for! Best salad dressing ever - I wanted to drink it from the bowl. Fish was grilled perfectly, 1
A random, 1
After searching for a cool treat on a hot day we stumbled upon this gem. The owner, 1
We were a group of 8 that met at The Good Egg for breakfast.  Staff quickly made arrangements for our group and brought beverages immediately.   The restaurant began to buzz with business and our food was a little slow arriving but the French Toast was delicious and worth the wait., 1
This store has such a bad rap, 1
Great Americanos and lattes. Haven't jumped on their baked good as there is just something off to me about vegan products but I'll leave that stuff to the kids that love it :)  Apparently I need to try their frozen soft-serve thang... Soynami...it's where it's at i keep hearing.   Great great great job on the renovation of the building and thoughtful material choices and design. A very nice addition to 7th street. Nice to see, 1
I have only eat the Pho so my review is biased but the Pho is dang good. Best I have had in Phoenix at a restaurant. So far only my bro's wife makes better Pho!, 1
$3 Spicy Bloody Mary - absolutely the best I've had so far in Phoenix (besides my own, 1
Best place to eat and satisfy your craving for cow. Sure this place serves other meat like Chicken Parmesan, 1
Damn... this place was a lot of fun. We played for the $1 per game bowling special (weekdays, 1
Great service. Great food. Enjoyed dinner here. They take reservations three or more. What I enjoyed most was their ability to not allow the place to become hectic. Crowded but relaxing. Food didn't take to long and was excellent. We had spaghetti and meatballs, 1
Always packed which is a good sign! Very good food, 1
It's always Delish!! The pancakes are The best!!!  My mother flipped over the grits, 1
We got excellent customer service from a very nice lady, 1
I ordered take-out from here the other night and ate my way into a delightful oblivion! I ordered the Chinese/Japanese bbq pork bun and a order of the Spicy Tuna Sandwich. It was so delicious with just the right amount of spice and flavor! I have been craving more ethnic food and gave this restaurant a look off of campusfood.com. Can't wait to dine-in and try some more sushi & the other food offered at this restaurant., 1
Visited here on a recent trip to Montreal. Ambiance was fun and welcoming. Great indoor seating in front of large open windows looking out on to peaceful Montreal street. Great Servers. Very friendly and informative. We found out the history of the restaurant and heard a bit about the current owners' effort to turn it into the stylish establishment it now is. We ordered from the specials menu which offered tasty dishes like roasted pork loin with asparagus and fennel and pan seared halibut with bacon. Wine list offered affordable quality options. To top it off they were playing 70's disco all night which was awesome. All in all a very enjoyable experience. We will return on our next visit., 1
My sister ordered a cake from Decadent Designs for my baby shower and it turned out GREAT!  The cake was a surprise for me and I loved it.  My sister gave them the shower invitation, 1
4 stars for a Walgreens you ask? Well it is based on the convenience of this place! Right on the strip and it has almost anything you could think of including prepared foods. The store is huge - 1 1/2 levels.  The prices here were double on some things from back home but what would you expect on the strip?  HUGE lines waiting to checking out but they actually move people in and out very quickly., 1
I wish they had a bigger venue! Love their crepes, 1
Visited Fuji last night with my in-laws, 1
If you have, 1
Tried this place a couple of weeks ago and really liked it. Here's the quick and dirty...  Parking -- free parking in the adjacent lot  Food -- very good! I was in a party of 7 and everyone liked what they ordered. We had two kinds of tortilla chips with a fantastic chipotle salsa-- we actually bought an extra order to take home; a green salsa -- also excellent; and avocado dip similar to guacamole. I ordered a burger which was huge (8 oz) and very good and a side salad which came tossed in their house honey vinagrette which was also very good. It was too much for me to eat but everything was cooked perfectly.   They also have game on their menu like the elk/buffalo burger and elk meatballs along with traditional steak, 1
I came here for lunch on Saturday, 1
I really enjoyed my meal at Lucille's.  My friend and I had a super friendly waitress, 1
Love the look of the Club. Had a lot of people outside waiting to get in. The staff was nice and made sure we were taken care of.. The DJ played really good music. The waitress was good and kept checking with us threwout the night. Sundays is my fav night there. One of the best clubs in Vegas.., 1
If you want to have fun while you eat this is the spot. I had tilapia, 1
Ellie is AWESOME! She does such a wonderful job and really listens to what you want done with your color and cut. she is also great at giving you suggestions if you are looking to try something new.  The salon is GORGEOUS and you really feel comfortable and like you're at home during your services. I highly recommend all of the stylists at Brush, 1
This is the best nail shop I've been to in Las Vegas & Henderson!! The shop has a spa like atmosphere & the staff is extremely skilled! I got a gel mani & they did an excellent manicure & massage first which normally most places rush through. In addition they were amazing at handling all our design requests. There were 7 of us for a birthday party girls spa day & they made all our designs perfect & even served us champagne & strawberries!!! LOVE, 1
I didn't know what to expect when I came here ...maybe this would taste like Rubios? I think the fish tacos are much better here then Rubio's but the Shrimp taco impressed me the most ! I was expecting it to be made of popcorn shrimp but they were good sized shrimps for the money you pay. My husband had the Carne Asada burrito he said it was better then Robertos....I was like, 1

If I'm driving through DeForest you can be sure to find me at Ehlenbach's! Sure it is a touristy cheese castle and you can probably get great cheese curds at a local grocery store in Anytown, 1
What an experience.  When my friends booked this I was hesitant, 1
We have purchased mattresses from this Bedmart location on two occasions and worked with Brian Roberts both times.  First of all, 1
Finally made my long-awaited return, 1
Terrific food and cheerful service. ALL the food is well done. The sauces are good and if I could one thing, 1
Always a good experience.  Friendlyy service and a great price, 1
This is my kind of place: Beer made on site, 1
I stayed here a night before a meeting at the airport.    It is typical of the brand.  Check in was fast and friendly.    The airport shuttle runs every 30 minutes and it only takes 5 minutes or so to get to the terminal.  Park and fly fills up quickly so, 1
I LOVE this place! I found it on yelp when I was looking for breakfast places near the airport.  The bakery is in a little shopping center and unless you are actually looking for it you may miss it.  We went for breakfast and had the vegetable omelet. It was like $5 and it includes coffee or soda, 1
Pretty nice place to stay. Pool was nice but that might have just been the group I was with. The rooms were decent, 1
My wife and have have attended numerous parishes in the valley.  There are differences between each and we tested three.  St Anthony's became our fit.  The folks who make up "our church" are wonderful.  We feel much more welcomed here and invited (not pressured) to join in.  With the most recent blessing from the Bishop to build a permanent home, 1
Fair pricing, 1
The remodel in here is nice. Theres an area for kids to sit & play and the space is better utilized. Its also updated.   The service is a lot better since the remodel as well. They now deliver your order to your table for you, 1
Just a note about the reservation issue I had, 1
Nicest hotel I have stayed at.   1) Located right in the middle of the strip.  2) 5 star 3) New property 5) Non-smoking property  Once I got to the Vdara I was blown away by how modern it is.   Love that my room had two flat screen tv's; one for the living room and the other for the bedroom.   My favorite part of the room was the bathroom.The tub is AMAZING. Don't know how but it is designed so that two people can sit in it and be comfortable resting their heads.   Found a deal through hotwire.com for about $130 for a studio. Loved it., 1
My dad and I were very impressed with the new Milo's in Urbana.  They got us in on a Friday night without reservations, 1
I planned a destination wedding for us. We got married here in 2/05. The planning online was so simple. The day of our wedding, 1
We received excellent, 1

Outstanding! In San Francisco we are spoiled with some of the finest world-class sushi restaurants anywhere.  This was exquisitely prepared, 1
(Late posting guys! I just realized it was an unfinished review. This visit was on 4/1/14-4/03/14)  I really enjoyed it here because it was QUIET  :-)  I requested the 2nd floor. The staff was great! You get a "free" soda upon check in. I would definitely go back! I checked out, 1
I stayed here for a business conference this week and was impressed with this hotel.    The staff here is incredible. Everyone was very friendly, 1
If your kids have been struck by the Warhammer bug, 1
I got the croissant sandwich and the buzz (a chocolate/coffee/protein smoothie). Didn't take super long after ordering and tasted great...pesto is a nice touch. Parking was atrocious, 1
We really like this venue. It is small so there is no bad seat in the house. We had a general admission for a concert and are so glad we didn't get seats. They were crammed together in front. The lawn is tiered to you have great views of the stage. Sit on the grass and the embankment behind you serves as back support. The bathrooms are clean and the beers somewhat reasonable. Glad we ate before we went.  Dinging a star because the acoustics are not as they should be. Who doesn't love and outdoor venue on balmy spring evenings?, 1
Definitely one of my favourite hotels to have ever stayed in! The Sheraton hotel on Festival Square is an absolute haven, 1
All around great experience. We were greeted by staff welcomed and helped ordering our pizzas. Our family has been papa Murphy's take and bake customers since 1997 and we were leery of others but my wife and I agree that this summer noble Romans will be our new family favorite! The sauce was flavorful and the ingredients fresh Mgr Kevin from Indiana really was an informative touch. See ya soon guys the pizza was "WOW", 1
the hours change every so often, 1
The lowdown is that it's Christmas, 1
While other lovebirds were dining at wining at Michael Mina on Valentine's Day, 1
Went again tonight and tried the chicken curry. Again I had a fantastic meal. I ordered a 10 for spice level and it wasn't quite a 10 but I do understand at a certain point there is a trade off between spicy and flavorful and my dish did not disappoint there. It was delicious and I even had enough left over for lunch tomorrow.   Again I had great service and the staff was friendly.  The food and staff set it apart from the other Thai restaurants in the area and their prices make it a great destination for frequent visits., 1
The newest addition to Marchmont's bar scene (ahem, 1
Wonderful! That's the world to describe our experience at this restaurant. It is very pricey, 1
Big Wong is located on Spring Mountain Rd. in the same shopping center as top competitors such as Monta and Raku. At first, 1
Such a beautiful store! Innovative, 1
We used to go here at least once a month. Good food at fair prices. However, 1
The trail is amazing and I saw a bunch of petroglyphs and amazing desert with its natural wildlife! It was beautiful, 1
When I first reviewed this establishment in 2010, 1
While my review is sort of one sided I will speculate a little on the other services as well.   The SB is a nice nook of the far side of the lake. There is boat rentals, 1
Great Sandwiches. The corn fritters are amazing., 1
I have to agree with comment below ... I LOVE THIS PLACE nice good nails and last a while. I have been coming here for over 15 years and even thou I live so far I still come here. They do the nails by taking there time I seriously can go a month and half with a full set. It's good quality and they do a great job plus they love kids and do my daughters names too. I love it wouldn't go anywhere else. ALSO there gel nails can last me 2 months plus looooooove it!!, 1
After last night, 1
Finally a fresh lunch option in the desert :)  I enjoy visiting/working in Phoenix, 1
Gyros Sandwich under $4, 1
local hawaiian food...cheap.  i liked the katsu with green curry.  off the strip.  kind of fattening.  i think there are a few locations in las vegas., 1
Not much more I can add to the reviews already posted.     An amazing selection of plants from all over the world in an expansive, 1
Delicious macarons for only $1.65 each?  YES please!  It was so hard to control myself and only order 4 macarons, 1
Seems like a nice enough little airport; the staff was all very friendly. Fueling up was a bit of a debacle, 1

Service was perfect. Food was tasty. Ambiance was great - we sat out on the patio and had a lovely time people watching and enjoying the weather.  We ordered two pizzas and the meatballs appetizer for two adults, 1
We come here a lot for brunch. French toast is amazing! Always good service, 1
In the hip Hard Rock Hotel, 1
So I am not usually in the Tempe area, 1
Best bagels in the world - better than New York better than Toronto - just come get 1 from the wooden stove and ask for cream cheese and plastic knife - so u can open it up and eat just outside the store. Amazing, 1
Ended up going here after a really bad experience with another spa. We were seated immediately, 1
I was in a car crash on 8/10/08 and came to Pittsburgh to do rehabilitation after my spinal cord injury. I decided to join the JCC to do additional rehab exercises.  The facility is very nice. They have many treadmills, 1
The best bridal experience! I had been on the hunt for over 2 weeks, 1
Got in a wreck on the way home from work on the 15.  An unfortunate circumstance that happens to everyone some time or another.  Metropolitan Auto Body was close by, 1

I don't know how many times I get asked this question, 1
We came to Vegas for the weekend and in the process of walking around, 1
They really blew me away - and it was just my first visit! There's nothing like seeing the fresh produce come in the door from the farmers market right as you enter- to then be wow-ed by the decor. The restaurant is done in clean, 1
After way too many days and nights on the strip I headed out with the rental car looking for a sports bar or neighborhood haunt so that I could sit and relax and not be paying $12 for a drink  or $40 for dinner. I drove down Flamingo and saw the sign that said 'smokers welcome'. I thought how Iclever is that marketing scheme? I kept driving and all I could find was Mexican and Asian restaurants and bars-and I was looking for a burger or sandwich place. I decided to head back to Zodies. The lot was empty except for 2 cars. I went in--was greeted by one customer at the bar-a gal who worked 3 jobs to make it in Vegas and the bartender, 1
The second best Chinese restaurant in Madison according to me, 1
The top level is the best level in my opinion. It's the quietest level and you get a good view of downtown Phoenix from both the North and South side ceiling to floor windows. The only real drawback is the smell that comes from the DVD and CD section, 1
ITS HUGE.  yes thats what she said.  I feel like I walk for days.  Thank god for all the comfortable rocking chairs everywhere so that I can have a kip by the window while I wait for my layover.  Also they happen to have a plethora of healthy food options.  Not just auntie annes, 1
Price point excellent! Fresh, 1
OK...aside from bowling and movies, 1
Been to Vegas many times, 1
My first visit to Camelback was a couple of days ago on the recommendation of a good friend. I was fed up with the questionable, 1
First day. Really had fun!, 1
Eating these little puppies brings tears to my eyes. Everyone complains about how packed it is, 1
Lisa was wonderful and helped us find the perfect piano for my son!  I highly recommend My First Piano for kids or adults who are looking to play, 1
Really cool independent coffee shop. Very comfortable place, 1
While I am not a big fan of the frozen hot chocolate (think glorified Frappuccino), 1
Just what we were looking for!  After trekking over to Notre Dame in the hot sun this past weekend, 1
Yes... It was as good as the ratings suggest. Better in fact. I live in AZ, 1
Mmmmmmmm, 1
Nice location, 1
The other reviews were kinda lame. Bravi is great and extremely underrated. I have had almost everything on the menu and would get it all again. It is fast and tastes great. The Tuscan tomato soup is seriously one of the best soups I have ever had. My favorites are the Portobello ravioli and the Chicken parmesan. Everyone needs to try this place. Its worth the it, 1
We always have a great time when we go there with the family! Great atmosphere! Good prices! Great food! Friendly faces!, 1
The East Blvd. location does need it's own review because it is a pretty exceptional location. With ample comfortable seating an open spaces it is easy to relax and read, 1
I had their enchiladas with beef, 1
I'm going to try and not over-state it here.    I love Steve's Espresso.    Maybe there are fancier coffee shops out there.  I'm not going to say this is the best Coffee shop in the world.  But it *is* the best one I've been to in this area and I've tried quite a few.  The atmosphere is decent, 1
I have been checking around the web and find listings that say this place is closed. It was closed many months ago, 1
My girlfriend and I shared the Peking Duck, 1
I've been coming here for a while and I love the food and amazing service. I highly recommend this place!, 1
I wasn't familiar with any of Shania Twain's new songs but I still wanted to go because I enjoyed some of her songs in the past like : Still the one, 1
This Coffee Shop smells so good and is a kinda cool spot for Hot Coffee.    The Coffee was better than most of the places. I believe this place and the Coffee have potential!  The place has potential because it has a comfortable, 1
It would get five stars if it had a larger drink selection and better prices. But, 1
touristy thing to do, 1
This place has been increasing in popularity over the past few years. You'll be stuck in a medium-paced line outside if you show up after 11:00p.m. on a Friday or Saturday. They are extremely serious about staying at capacity, 1
As a kid I wanted superpowers. I wasn't picky about it; any power would've been sufficient. Super strength. Super speed. I'd even have settled for being able to break things just by screaming. But alas, 1
This place has an awesome happy hour 7 days a week...which is not so easy to find in Vegas. And, 1
Melinda at the front desk was wonderful! Great staff!  You will not go wrong staying at this Embassy Suites at the Biltmore!, 1
This hotel is surprisingly simple.  With all the gimics offered by neighboring hotels, 1
This is a shout out to John at the valet for Aria.  During my latest visit to Vegas, 1
Had a white pizza with ricotta, 1
"Dem apple cider donuts doe."  I came here a week or so ago to pick our pumpkin to carve. Heard good things about this place so I wasn't surprised that I loved my visit so much. :) I kinda forgot I was in Vegas for a little bitl  Free parking right outside. Go straight to the Apple Cider Donuts stand! 6 hot, 1
A beautiful display of home decor items, 1
XS is definetely one of the hottest clubs in Vegas.  Very elegant, 1
Well at a tech conference occasionally you're allowed to indulge more-so if you're sitting with analysts and important blog writers. I didn't because I had already eaten dinner.   However I did order the pumpkin soup and it was fantastic, 1
Great atmosphere. The porkbellies are amazing! Had a nice cheese board.  Also the Spicey Octopuss was interestingly very good. Will be back., 1
With the old location in Chandler believed by many (including myself) to be the best Chinese Buffet in Arizona, 1
really enjoyed my first visit to Beckett's Table. You can tell the owners are professional restaurateurs, 1
I had never had my brows done before and a friend who loves having hers threaded was  in town, 1
Very good food.   Some of the best I have had anywhere.   Very good prices.  For our trip to Montreal this was some of the best we had there.  We were able to get a table when we arrived but soon after that they started to line up.   The food comes out fast and they move the people through as well., 1
During numerous trips to Vegas, 1
On our last trip to Las Vegas we wanted to join a friend who lives there for dinner but I was ready to get off the Strip. He is a server at one of the Casinos so he hit up his other friends for a great restaurant since he knows we much we eat out. Funny enough he said he was nervous because when he comes to Denver I take him to super good places.   We got there on a Thursday afternoon after the lunch rush. The server seemed very excited to have people who were ready to dine and drink wine. I can only imagine he was use to people rushing to get back to work.   We had such a great experience and the food was amazing. We were there for several hours and just didn't want to leave. The ambiance was beautiful and we were able to enjoy the shaded patio. I love going in ethnic places and the staff still have their accents. It made me feel like there might have actually been Italians in the back cooking.   In the end we were all debating over dessert. We finally decided on the creme brulee, 1
Love Love Love me some Trader Joe's.  Parking.... park in the back. You don't have to deal with the craziness in the front. There is a safe walkway right to Trader Joe's from the back parking lot so you don't have to walk around the shopping center.  Service is usually great.  The selection is even better.  My dad was recently diagnosed with a disease and he has to eat completely gluten free. I'm really thankful for Trader Joe's. They have an awesome and yummy at that, 1
If you are looking for an ugly sweater for the ugly sweater Christmas party, 1
Had dinner here as a group of 6 earlier in Jan.   D and I arrived uncharacteristically early thinking we would have a drink in the pub but finding no empty tables we decided to go through to the restaurant and just have a drink at the table while we waited for our friends to show up.  We were shown to the table then left completely to our own devices for about 20mins until I got fed up and waved my arms around until I finally got someone's attention to come over. It took us 3 tries to get drinks as they didn't have what we wanted the first 2 times... (I hope this is due to no deliveries being made over the Xmas/New Year period, 1
I went in for a Sunday brunch at about 11:30 am with a few friends. At the most, 1
Decent coffee. Fine service. Nostalgia in the worst way. A buck off for having to stand around because someone was chatting outside is reasonable. Nice seating outdoors. OK cracked seats and biting flies but so what. This is my coffee spot and I'm stickin to it, 1
STK is good, 1
After having my lashes done at a salon, 1
I wanted to save some of my review for Hotel du Vin to outside of the Yelp event that I attended recently. It first caught my eye with the window display of wine casks that made me what to squash my nose up against the window in an alcohol-induced frenzy, 1
We stumbled upon this place while out and about. We love locally owned places and Genaro's fit the bill perfectly. The food was excellent (even my 5 year old loved it) and the service was great.  We'll be back!, 1
Been here many times before and so had certain expectations. Food, 1
One my first trip to Pittsburgh at the beginning of February of this year, 1
"Thunder Dan" lives on in Downtown Phoenix!    This is a very good choice if you're looking for a cool sports bar atmosphere before/during/or after a Suns/Dbacks game while in downtown.  The ambiance is great being dimmly lit, 1
I love this place.  I usually come here since it is right around the corner from my parents.  The pedicures last FOREVER!  The ladies are all friendly and nice, 1
I absolutely love this place. Great prices, 1
The best Cirque show I have seen so far. The actors are amazing!, 1
Hubby and I love this place and a regular haunt for us.  My Hubby's fav: adobo fried rice and spam musubi.  My favorite: pinakbet and Thelma's special.  This is a must try for anyone craving Filipino food., 1
After a horrible experience with another property management company, 1
Delicious shrimp fried rice. The best part to me was all of the extra sauces they have on the table, 1
THE MALL OF AIRPORTS!!!!  This airport is HUGE, 1
3.5, 1
This hotel is known for their frequent visitors from Hawaii.  And, 1
I love this place: great food.   We went to LV for a week and got to know this place. We went there three times. The meals are decently priced and delicious, 1
We enjoyed this restaurant. It has a nice location along the canal inside the shopping corridors of the Venetian. There are not really any walls in the dining area of this restaurant but some tables are located under a roof of this restaurant while others are "outside" under the high blue roof of the Venetian.  The atmosphere is nice. It is somewhat loud because let's face it, 1
Ok. 4 stars for a solid meal. The menu has a little bit of everything, 1
Quintessential college liquor store. They have all the macro brews that any store would have plus a decent selection of micros (Wisconsin and national), 1
Wild Adventures Zoo is in the process of being built. Wild Adventures Zoo will be more than a physical zoo. They are also an organization that includes educating people about animals. This review pertains to the organization holding an event on Saturday, 1
Alamo Car Wash always delivers AMAZING service. From the time you drive in to the time you drive out, 1
I have been to most of the buffets on the strip because when my father lived in Las Vegas, 1
Great food. It's indicative by the long lines at lunch and dinner time. Which I would say is the only downfall to the place. It's small, 1
Comfortable place, 1
A frequent hangout spot with friends.  I wouldn't come here just for drinks, 1
After living in Vegas for 3+ years things start to look the same on the strip. Same vibe, 1
This is what willis was talking about!  I tried to find decent sushi in the Scottsdale area and i failed again and again until I hit up Hiro last night.   Great place! Good Sake selection, 1
I called today to set an appointment for an oil change and they told me if I came now they could service my car. So I went and got an oil change, 1
I love this place. Why?  1. They are extremely friendly and accommodating. They always take care of us. 2. They cook everything to order. Things are out slower than your average place but this is why. 3. Everything is crafted and designed to their own tasty standard. 4. They get creative with specials now and then. Right now, 1
Tiny smoky casino with the best bargain shrimp cocktail at $1.99. It used to be 99 cents (just to show you how long I've been living here). There are different kinds of cocktails, 1
There is so much to try here that I have not yet had the pleasure! I have been here twice and for both occasions it was for breakfast. I have gotten the Flower Child Scramble both times as it is absolutely divine. It comes with a side of hash browns that are always cooked to perfection! I have also had a mimosa there and they make them with fresh oranges, 1
This is the real deal people.  Hands down !!  Come here and be blowin away by everything. Haha no pun.   Tanks in the parking lots, 1
I love all the Villages.  Finally settled on DC Ranch since it was closest to my house.  For awhile, 1
I was Halloween shopping across the street and my GF suggested we give this place a try as "I love them their food is so much better than a fastfood chain restaurant" As she works for a Burger Restaurant  I was skeptical but agreed thinking I would tell on her the next time I see her boss.  Your secret is safe though I agree 100%.   The food was top notch; the service was great and she was correct it mixes in the best of a fast-food chain and a mom & pop sit down restaurant.  The menu is a bit much for them to specialize in anything but specific but my burger was done correctly and the onion rings were top notch.  It was hot so I decided to grab a Strawberry frosty/shake and it was delicious and had plenty of fruit chunks mixed throughout the cup;  (just wish they didn't get stuck in the straw)  All in all the price was a little high but for the quality of the service and the food I won't complain about it and say you get what you pay for and if you are comfortable with another chains discount/$1 menu by all means go for it but please give these guys a try; you may just start skipping those other chains and saving up to eat here., 1
Great show!  Let me start by saying that this was a spur of the moment selection.  My wife and I were sitting in Subway, 1
I just moved into the Matthews-Indian Trail area and I was soooo happy to know that their was a local place that serves Pho and Banh Xeo (Vietnames Pancakes)! I met the owner and he was so friendly, 1
We discovered this place on Yelp. It's in a shopping center and you'd easily pass it by. It's family owned and operated and its pretty surprising to see some much TLC going into food in a strip mall. My wife was very happy to get the a sample of veggie lasagne, 1
I must profess my love for Showmars. There aren't many businesses that deserve 5 stars, 1
I have attended a few events for my college at the Mimosa Grill. It's a great and elegant place to have a group event. The food is amazing and service has always been great.   Recently I went to their BBQ event. It was all you can eat for $24. I went to see a musician play who is amazing. The crowd was very engaged and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Although I didn't try the BBQ I also had a great time. $2 beer specials and live music on a beautiful Sat evening. Cant get much better than that., 1
Typical Paradise Bakery experience - - - fast service, 1
we had so much fun watching this. Great Job guys!!!, 1
Our soccer team stayed here for the second year in a row and it's only gotten better.  This place is clean, 1
This was a last minute decision to stay here. I got a great deal online and it was conveniently located. The room was nice and clean. Kimberley at the front desk was awesome - what a riot., 1
Why the other Costcos in town don't have a self checkout is beyond me. For those of us who usually only buy 3 or 4 things, 1
This restaurant is outstanding! I have been here more times then I can count. The margaritas are delicious (I get a strawberry blended margarita) as well as the food. My two suggestions would be to always get the guacamole for an appetizer and then the smoked chicken enchiladas for the entr\u00e9e., 1
I would definitely recommend coming here for the perfect mid-week date night.  We had reservations on a late Monday night and it was not packed at all.  Service was excellent.  The drinks were so-so.  I tried the two off of the specialty drink menu and one cosmopolitan.  The soup of the day was a fire-roasted tomato with shrimp and crab.  That was excellent, 1
Girasole is one of the places in Pittsburgh I always go to when I have visitors from out of town. The quaint, 1
I couldn't believe when my friend was making me stay here. Lo and behold, 1
The first time we went 2 years ago we went for dinner. I love that they have Shiner Bock - not a lot of places do.  I had the pulled pork which is my sandwich of choice that I base places on and the BBQ sauce was amazing - I bought a bottle before we left.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and loved it also.    The second time we went last year, 1
I always call in my order and take it home. Food is great but, 1
Farm Basket is one of those nostalgic treats I allow myself from time to time, 1
Another fantastic experience at Cafe Monarch!    Chris and the team helped provide a memorable experience for a 50th birthday party of 20+ people --- starting with a cocktail reception and hors d'oeuvres in the candle-lit courtyard -- perfect atmosphere.   We moved inside for an exquisite and creative dinner.....with excellent, 1
None of this is news.  If you want a dirt cheap meal that will make both your tongue and wallet sing, 1
Coming from California (most recently Long Beach), 1
eating the Devil Dog is no easy task.  Its a pound hot dog with a huge bun and its so delicious. If you finish it you get a free tee shirt., 1
Favorite place to drop some bones on delicious and healthy food.   Pros:  Their selection of dried fruit and nuts is amazing. The only place to find honest to goodness dried fruit with no added sugar or color. Make sure to check the package to ensure you're getting the good stuff...They have a few items that have added sugar (e.g. dried cranberries).  Oh my holy baby CHEESES! Their cheese selection is infinitely cheaper than Harris Teeter. Never buy cheese from the Teeter again! You'll pay way less for the same, 1
Visiting from Chicago for Spring Break and looking for a good meal to celebrate my east coast born & raised husband's birthday request for seafood.  This place was perfect!   We had very attentive service from Noel and liked that things were done well and quick, 1
So Big Daddy's isn't really as disappointing as I initally made it sound. It was never bad in the first place, 1
GO HERE! Just do it! I stumbled across Taco Y Taco while in Vegas for a business trip - it's my go to place every time I'm there now. I'm a post Californian, 1
My favorite Thai place., 1
Right down the street from Arepas, 1
We just stumbled upon this place but I'm very glad we did. The food was delicious, 1
I enjoyed taking the karve class. The instructor was really friendly and helpful throughout the class, 1
I called Roofing Consultants of Arizona for a chimney area leak. Gary called the next business day to schedule an appointment for the free estimate. He was friendly, 1
I utterly loathe buffets.  Seriously, 1
Loved this place and spent way too much money here. The best thing about Kabuki is the Happy Hour pricing. Selected items are 30% to 50% off. You'll get decent sushi for decent prices, 1
I seriously love this place. They are always so nice and attentive. I like the quality they put into their work too. It's never rushed or looks sloppy. I live really close and will not be going anywhere else as long as Colorful Nails is in business!, 1
Two paths diverged into a wood, 1
Grab a latte and make your grocery shopping even sweeter!   The staff are really friendly and seem to enjoy what they do. I grabbed a bag of their roasted beans and they gave my husband a complimentary tall coffee...great perk!   Free WiFi. Plenty of seating indoors and out., 1
I have now had Lulu's on the Move twice and I can say this food truck is really as good as it gets. The chefs here, 1
I only started going to Vegas within the past year and a half, 1
My friends from California always go to bevmo and then a buddy from here in Phoenix told me to go there and get some specialty drinks. I was pretty amazed at the selection.  Including the soda selection. I also buy all my beer mugs there. They have a good amount of drinking glasses to choose from as well, 1
The Hotel has better service than the Hyatt at Cheney Ranch, 1
I was craving a gyro and went to yelp to help me give me some ideas. Due to all the great comments about the food, 1
The farm burger was so good. My friend also had the euro burger which was also good. The strawberry shake was to die for.  The services was also good.  Overall everything was excellent. I will go back soon., 1
A decent buffet with lots of choices. Get the 2X1 coupon from the Nevada AAA guide., 1
We have been to bluburger twice now & have not been disapointed. I love all the combinations of meat, 1
I love the sandwich, 1
The food was excellent. I went there for Friday brunch around 11am. It wasn't too busy and got a seat at the bar area right away. There were still plenty of tables available too. They have tables that one side is a booth type of bench seat and the other are awkward wooden chairs. I saw a larger man sitting in one of the chairs who looked uncomfortable. Make sure you request a booth rather than a table that has only chairs. I ordered the B.L.A.T. ( bacon lettuce avacado and tomato ) sandwich. This was one of the best BLT sandwiches I have ever had. I love that put nice big chunks of avacado on the sandwich. The bacon was thick and cooked well. No skimping on ingredients here. Would defiantly come here again for lunch/brunch again., 1
Great restaurant tucked in this shopping strip with a down home type atmosphere.  Food is always good and more than you can eat!  Portions are generous so sharing is a good idea.  Priced are reasonable. I have made this my breakfast stop when I am in the area., 1
Best patio dining experience I have ever had.  Food delicious, 1
The Hillside is close to my home and makes a nice walk with the family to go there for lunch/brunch. The food there is really good and I believe almost all food  is gathered from local growers.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo, 1
Cold beer and great cigar selection.  Brain was extremely helpful.  Definitely coming back., 1
If you are looking for diabetes with sprinkles on top, 1
We tried out the lunch specials and found them to be pretty good.  For about $6 we both got healthy portions of spicy food along with fairly good service.  Take a chance and go for the hotter dishes.  :-), 1
This place is surrounded by car dealerships and the closest other "business" is a place where people who got in trouble by Johnny Law have to talk to counselors about why they got in trouble in order to appease the court and have their crime forgiven.  Anyway, 1
Absolutely love this place! The bartenders are great! They are very knowledgeable. They have a great happy hour with both food and drink. Classy atmosphere. I do have two complaints. The lighting in the bar and the A/C. Please turn down the lights a little. I feel like I'm being interrogated. Also, 1
Are you a Localist?  This event has been going on for a while and the new location is awesome especially when the weather is amazing.  There are still a lot of people that don't know about this event, 1
I used vegasbooths in May 2014 for my wedding at the Suncoast. Robert did an awesome job communicating with me the whole time before the wedding to make sure I got everything I wanted. Him and his whole staff were great. I'll definitely use them again if I have any big events. They made our wedding a hit and everyone had a blast all night taking fun pictures that they could take home with them :) I know I will recommend to anyone who wants a good time. The music just added fun to the booth as well they have open or enclosed booths!, 1
Like other reviewers, 1
My new favorite happy hour spot! 1/2 priced wine (with excellent options to choose from) and select appetizers from 3-6 p.m. The cheese plate could well be one of the best in the Valley. Four chef selections with crostini and only about $8 at happy hour. The mac and cheese is heavenly, 1
Everything was pretty tasty! But I loved our waiter Allan! He was very nice, 1
NOT your standard airport restaurant fare!  Try the chicken poblano enchilada.  Service was friendly and attentive., 1
I have too much fun here. Location is great for avoiding strip traffic and the food court is really convenient. Service at the restaurants is also good and ya gotta love the pool. Staff also is friendly., 1
I'm not the comic or collectable type, 1
Excellent food and reasonably priced.  I had the Tomato, 1
On week nights, 1
Excellent Margaritas! Had fun here visiting my cousin, 1
i usually dine at the bar here, 1
Southside isn't normally the neighborhood you think to go for date night, 1
This place and the Rio and Cesar's have the BEST buffets period. I'm down and I'll down many Mimosas to wash down all the king crab. They have it all. It's a beautiful hotel and I'm okay dropping a little $$$ on a craps table while there!, 1
Definite diamond in the rough.  The crepes are fantastic, 1
I really love this place for quick reasonable priced chinese and sushi rolls.  Typically I wouldn't order rolls from a place like this but they are actually pretty good.  I feel like they are a tad expensive because they are priced almost like a fancy sit down full service sushi place, 1
So finally got around too checking out yet another local style action in Vegas. One that has rather unique name but one that truly backs up the "Aloha" Spirit!! The first step walked in the whole staff shouts out "Aloha". Everyone is extremely helpful comes too the menu. It not your typical plate lunch action local style food. It goes in three different steps so for first timer like me (lot of confusion). The staff takes you through each one going over the options. If your expecting some mac salad, 1
I've been eating at this location pretty regularly since they opened it. What's not to like about Wildflower? The bread is terrific, 1
I can't even go to Atherton Market without thinking of Pickleville pickles, 1
This review is for the weekend lunch buffet.  Norm R, 1
Clean Catch has a lot going for it, 1
Just recently stayed here for Martin Luther King Jr. weekend and I still love Aria.  I'm not sure if it's the best place to gamble since it seemed like everyone in my party lost a lot of money but it's all good, 1
My girlfriend and I came to Phoenix from Colorado and decided to go bra shopping. We did a a search and found this Soma store. We almost didn't go because of the bad review. I'm so glad we went! First off the store is located in a really nice part of Phoenix and a really nice shopping area. Second the store is clean and the staff are wonderful. They did a fitting for me they would bring me all kinds of different bras in different sizes shapes and colors until I found exactly the kind of bras that fit perfect I love the bras, 1
I have no idea what all these one and two stars are talking about. They are very good for what is actually around here. I've lived in the Mesa area for nearly 8 years now, 1
Stayed here for a 3 day conference last weekend. Shuttle service to and from the airport runs every half hour and is free. There doesn't seem to be anything exciting around this general area so I was stuck here for 3 days. Overall, 1
These gentlemen are amazing.   My son loves barber shops and when we moved I was worried I would have a hard time finding a new place.   This place is perfect and my son came home very happy with his haircut., 1
FINGER LICKING GOOD!!!   I love Famous Daves there food is sooo delicious!   I usually order the 2 meat combo and get the Beef Brisket and the Chopped Pork and it comes with a corn bread muffin and corn on the cob and your choice of two sides i always order my meal with there Wilbur Beans and there Firecracker Green Beans for the side choices.   Omg let me tell ya their Beef Brisket is so delicious the way they cook it makes it so juicy and tender my favorite dish here by far. I also like the Chopped pork but unfortunately that's hit or miss if its over cooked forget about it, 1
Ok so I'm only doing "mostly veg" right now so I may have meat once or twice a week. I decided to use up one of my meat allowances here and boy did I get my money's worth. I had the Truffle mac (and cheese) with hot italian sausage. My goodness, 1
I am so happy this location opened up.  It's so close to home and honestly better than any other pizza place I have ever been too.  The serious slices are as big as a new born baby and taste like GOD himself kneaded the dough.  I would recommend this place to any and everyone I meet., 1
This is a great place to take your children, 1
This as the first time I'd used Yelp. Great recommendation of restaurants, 1
One of my Favorite spots in Vegas!!! The attention to detail and the use of high quality ingredients = a master piece of sweets and savory options!!! Megan Romano = Genius !!! Keep up the good work!!!, 1
The timing and the location was perfect.  My wife and I celebrated our 17th anniversary and wanted late dinner.  This location was close to our hotel.  The service was great as we were immediately seated on the patio (we arrived at 10PM on a Sunday evening...closing time was 11PM).  Our server, 1
Love this pizza. Always a plethora  to choose from., 1
Truffle Parmesan Fries: YUM! Loving the truffle mayo for the fries.   Farm Burger: The runny egg really topped off the burger. Duck bacon...WHAT? Crazy but so good!   Hell's Kitchen burger: It was okay nothing special but I do like how I ordered a medium rare patty and that is exactly what I got! Nothing overcooked, 1
I got the tofu pad thai and some giant spring rolls (fried on the inside, 1
Pretty good! The buffet is good and has a lot of vegetarian options. They could definitely spice up the options a bit (after all, 1
We ordered family meal...first visit!!, 1
This is a really nice mall.....I went on a Saturday and it wasn't crowded and was mellow. Walked through the whole thing and the fact that it has a Barnes and Noble is such a plus. The food court is cool I got a lrg cheese steak combo for like $10 and it was alot of food and good. They also have a cinnabon which I love but because the sandwich was so big I was 2 full and I didn't even eat the whole thing. It also has a brookstone and I always look at the vibrators I mean body messagers :) ...it reminds me of when Samantha from Sex and the City tried to return her's because as she put it "it failed to get me off". hehe Anyhoo this is a nice mall overall and I will be coming back., 1
Since moving to the Summerlin side of town, 1
30 mins for a new screen. Stayed and waited for the phone to be repaired. Got it done with no small talk. Just the way I like it. Good job guys., 1
It was fun I thought it would've been worse than what it was! The wait was the worst part.  And I didn't even have a heart attack, 1
The place is small but, 1
My husband orders from here quite a bit and I wanted to try it out, 1
Well this place is only 3 miles from my house so I finally succumbed to the hype and additionally had a burger craving.  I arrived only 20 minutes after they opened and they were already busy with two large groups; one all male tourist group and a large family group with many little ones.   Please remember that Bachi Burger also operates the Ramen restaurant next door so the hostess asks if you are their for Ramen or Bachi Burger.  This is kind of strange because when you are seated (which was right away) they give you both menus.  Hhmm!!! Once seated I was greeted by my server Dan who was very attentive and informative.  My water glass was consistently refilled and the staff busing the tables was excellent. So why no 5 stars.  Well, 1
They have a separate area just to pick people up, 1
I'm not all that much of a girly girl, 1
I love this place SO much! They definitely got me hooked! The prices are super reasonable and affordable. When I went I got to sample many different flavors before choosing what I wanted. You get a TON of shaved ice for the price and ice cream on the bottom is only 50c more! This stuff is the real Hawaiian deal and I'll never go anywhere else!, 1
This was my second dining experience at Fleming's and instead of dinner, 1
I just want to rave about those jelly chocolates they have in the display. I have tried every flavor, 1
Best breakfast in town, 1
I was hesitant of going because of the location and the fiasco when they hosted the Food Truck.  However I gave it another try and it was worth it.  There were some inconsistencies such as the front said you had to use only tickets to purchase food/drink inside, 1
I am so happy that Chelsea's Kitchen is in the place I practically live! I am happy to see good eats come to the airport. I have been happy with every thing here ... In fact, 1
Went in to check on the sizes of a storage unit and the lady was super helpful.  Really nice and accommodating and really tried to make it very convenient for me as far as location.  Explained all of the charges and benefits and even suggested their promotion that I was unaware of. Super easy and very happy to be working with them., 1
I have been using them for a month now and love the concept and price. The service and adjustments have been great., 1
Love my hair!  I bought a Groupon for a cut and hairline highlights because I was looking for a place that would give me a good haircut.   My hair is naturally curly so I've had more than my share of bad cuts... them they try to style it and it gets worse. Not Dean of Shadyside!  Ally took the time to discuss my the color of my highlights and make sure that I was comfortable with everything before she started (I have only had highlights done once before and they were bad).  The end product was great!   She listened to what I wanted and did it!   This is the first time in a very long time that I didn't leave a salon and pull my hair back.   My next appointment is already scheduled., 1
I'm going to keep this short and sweet... I don't like Thai food that much. Not a huge fan anyway. I am giving it 4 stars because that's what it already has. The spring rolls are excellent - very fresh and crispy. A little more flavor would be my only complaint if you twisted my arm to come up with something to complain about.  The summer rolls are good as well. I had some pad thai, 1
Hands down best club in vegas. Don't bother by looking elsewhere, 1
Endroit nostalgique, 1
Mighty fine southern comfort food.   I went today for chicken and waffles only to find that they were not doing sunday brunch until next sunday. I had a sampler plate of pork rib, 1
Time to finish up this review...LOL..Came here on opening day and the wait wasn't so bad. The hostess checks us in on an iPad and texts us when our table is ready. The whole service experience was so welcoming, 1
Love the atmosphere at this joint. It's become a regular stop in the last year. Great soundtrack!  If you try one food item, 1
Not a bad place to eat and drink. We passed this place a few times heading to our hotel and it looked decent from the outside. Menu on their website looked yummy.   Had the beef and salmon tartar. Salmon tartar was better. Then had the steak with foie gras - excellent! All the drinks I had were good. Hopefully you'll get Anthony the Bartender when you're there - super friendly and can make recommendations on places to go during your trip to Montreal., 1
one of the best new york style pizza joints on the west coast. I love their huge slices of cheesy thin crust pizza., 1
I've only gone here for lunch, 1
Music Together is great! The songs are really great and fun to sing, 1
Took my vehicle in today for a full detail - interior, 1

No complaints really, 1
Haven't been to Teharu is such a long time. I came in to get a quick lunch and that's what I got. I was a little worried having the previous experiences with them.   I came in an was greeted an seated as soon as I came in. I was alone this time so makes sense. My waiter was very pleasant and super happy. I came in for some sashimi so he took my order and gave it to the guys behind the bar. It took a little time to get my things but nothing to bad.   During my wait I was attended by my waiter and this other guy who was running around helping other customers. When he came by he asked if I wanted to order something since I wasn't taking anything off the belt. I told him I had an order coming and he went to check on it. I thought it was nice that they were actually checking in on me.   My food came by soon after and it was as good anything else I get here. The price was great and my waiter came to refill my drinks again and checked to see if I wanted to get anything else.  Overall I had a very nice time. The service was MUCH more pleasant and enjoyable compared to the last few times.  Only word of improvement I can offer was when I recieved my food I had like a stack of 3 plates for each order (which was 3) nine plates all over the place. Little bit of a mess. Since I ordered on one of those sheets I figured they coud have just charged me by that instead of all the plates. Although that is the norm of how they charge there so I should've have expected it., 1
The drip coffee and cold brew are more on the acidic side and the general attitude is a little unfriendly, 1
I really enjoyed Rhythm Kitchen. I live near by and it was a nice change to the strip restaurants. The lounge is towards the back and if you go in thru the front the girl at the front isn't very helpful, 1
Let me just talk to you about the day dreams I have had about this joint ever since my first visit (just yesterday).   If you are interested in fresh ingredients (of your choosing), 1
Jessica rocks as  a server.., 1
Went here to eat lunch while in Vegas on a business trip.  I was a bit skeptical due to the other reviews, 1
This was the best father's day idea yet. Go get bbq! Living relatively close to this place we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. so glad we did. We ordered a pound of pulled pork and a pound of brisket. The brisket was phenomenal. Great pink smoke ring, 1
There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in AZ and this one is one of the tops on my list.  It's not your average Mexican fast food.  It's a little more pricey but well worth it.  Their bean and cheese burrito is so good (they say no lard and I don't know what else they use to make it good).  Their carne asada and pastor tacos are done to perfection.  I stop by whenever I pass by this place., 1
Great food but oh my god it's spelled LETTUCE! LETTUCE! Not "lettus"! Every single day - EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. the specials sign is so badly written it nearly gives me heart failure. I know that's not the most important thing here, 1
I love the Bellagio (I love Venetian, 1
We've been looking for professional massage therapist for quite some time and came across Millie while we're searching in the internet, 1
Five stars is not enough. This is the second best burger in the U.S.    B&B Burger & Beer was a Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich venture. They had other jointly owned establishments in town, 1
Came on a busy night and they still got us a table within 5 minutes.  Service was very good (Jason was our waiter).  Was very prompt with refills and was very courteous.  Food was excellent.  Would definitely recommend!, 1
Solid Pizza...great wings!! This is our "to go to" pizza spot. You won't be disappointed., 1
Good Vietnamese. Pho is good. Chops are a bit fatty at times, 1
I have never seen candy like this before so the concept and taste is unique to me. When I was watching them make the candy, 1
I've been taking my vehicles here since 2008. No complaints. Love the shuttle service. Free coffee, 1
Don't pass this place up! Great food, 1
Fantastic! I absolutely love coming here & am never disappointed. I have yet to eat something less than delicious and memorable. My only complaint is that we never have room for dessert. And that I can't choose between menu items ;)   This place is not for you if 1) you are offended by tattoos 2) you like substituting ingredients in every dish instead of trusting the combinations planned 3) you insist on credit cards (as they only take cash, 1
Pappadeaux is over the 5 start rating.  It was the first time there.  The photos do not do the place justice as it is so much better in person.  Lucky to be seated away from the bar area to avoid the noise.  Very accommodating as asked to be seated at a bit larger table that was available.  There was a number in our group.  I'm more about the food and could care less about the settings, 1
Shoe department only: If you are going to women's shoes, 1
I stayed here with my wife for 2 weeks. The staff was very kind and had lost of hospitality and built rapport. Wonderful room, 1
This place is really in the middle of nowhere and it's too bad because I'm sure they will be out of business soon. I probably eat there at least once a week and I have yet to have a bad meal. The chipotle steak sandwich is my favorite and the people there are as friendly as they get. Hurry up and help save this place., 1
It's hard not to like Goodyear. It was our first park on our first game of our first Spring Training trip. Lots of firsts involved year. Loved our seats (in the shade after the first 30 minutes) and thought the food and beer selection was pretty good.  Parking wasn't too bad, 1
I got my windows tinted about a month ago.  I've waited this long to review DC just to make sure everything about the tint turned out okay.  Well, 1
I'm terrified of dentists and any dental work. When I had to get my wisdom teeth out (all four were impacted; one horizontally), 1
Having appetizers and drinks with Monica and Jeff Cohen. Wonderful Possole and the Hatch Catch is to die for. Fun evening!, 1
So happy to find a boba place with great boba! When I moved out to Madison and got struck with a craving for boba I realized I was moving to a place that may not serve this delicious treat. The first boba place I went to had decent boba but nothing to write home about. Plus it was farther away than I'd like it to be. Upon discovering this place, 1
Today was the second time I have had lunch at this place and WOW!!  My wife and I were driving around, 1
Baklava is awesome!   So YUM!  Pretty big portions and can be shared. If there are 4 of you.... get the Family Platter... it comes with kebabs, 1
I really enjoyed the older ambience at this place. Kind of an 80s old diner feel, 1
Some of the best Mexican food in AZ, 1
Pretty decent donuts. Some are better then Donut Hut's down the street, 1
This was so awesome. Meaty perfection followed by wonderfully comforting milk tart. Proper south african food at its best and obviously made with love., 1
I go here at least twice a month, 1
Ran in to have a key made and all 3 people I saw who were working made me feel very welcome! I didn't have a chance to look around the store but it looked like they had a large variety & selection of products. I'll be moving to this area soon and will definitely be a regular customer with the type of customer service I was shown. Keep up the great work!  P.S. It's in the Smith's shopping center if you can't find it right away., 1
I ate brunch here on a Saturday morning at 10 am and found the experience to be really pleasant!  The restaurant wasn't too busy and the atmosphere felt laid back and relaxed.  All of my friends and I opted to do the breakfast buffet.  We were concerned we wouldn't be able to eat $18 of food, 1
I looooooooooove this place!  Amazing breakfast/brunch. If you love eggs ANYTHING, 1
I had an amazing experience today here. A young man by the name of Anthony made my visit absolutely wonderful. I am Deaf, 1

This place is great! Downloaded a virus and when I called they were very helpful. They would have come to the house, 1
Great hot wings and burgers with fries. Orders may be slow somtimes but its worth the wait. Great Juke-Box, 1
My experience of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants is that they are generally of a high caliber.  Unlike other celebrity chefs, 1
Pricy but that's expected. Huge restaurant. Endless amounts of AMAZING MEAT! Oh my gosh. I was in heaven. Unfortunately, 1
This place is awesome! Great view, 1
Every time I visit the city I make it a point to eat dinner at Gibby's. Great steaks. Great drinks. The service is good considering how busy they get o the weekends. The prices are tourist focused so do not go there looking for a discount meal but you will not walk away hungry. No way.   Parking in this area of the city  is very tight so there early and be prepared to search for a parking spot., 1
Love that they have full hot breakfasts, 1
Hiro makes the best sushi in Phoenix, 1
Fabulous!  I needed an order for take away and fast. Not only did they whip up a Santa Barbara chicken sandwich and my beet salad super quick, 1
This is the perfect breakfast every time. The food is fresh the coffee is strong and my pooch can share breakfast with me on the patio. Perfect way to spend a slow Friday morning., 1
EXCELLENT CHINESE FOOD THAT DELIVERS I have gone to this location on Valle Verde for years and have loved this place. It's a great VERY FAST Chinese Food restaurant that serves very good food. Plus they deliver!  Last week I got my favorite dish. Not only did it come out in minutes, 1
Ah this is a plaice  proving that  punliness is next to codliness.  Good now that the we hate pun people are gone I can  let you in on a quiet, 1
Heard about this place from watching a show discussing Vegas & it's "happening" places.  Penn Jillette ( of Penn & Teller fame ( is a huge fan of this place.  So much so he has a booth & table ( I think he may of had it custom made ) in his personal kitchen.  It's a busy place...tourists, 1
I like Topaz Veterinary Clinic.  They have a wonderful, 1
When damaging your liver it's best to use only the freshest and best quality ingredients and if you want to do some serious damage then you should definitely check out Mardi Gras.    They freshly squeeze the oranges and grapefruits in front of you for your Screwdrivers and Greyhounds so you don't have to worry about nasty impurities from the fruit juice ruining your cocktail.  Why make your liver work harder than it already has to., 1
Best damn chorizo, 1
Grilled meat and ice cold beer.  Need I say more?  Yagyu is a true JAPANESE style yakiniku restaurant. Umm except that they serve some kimchi.  No lettuce cups though.  Just meat and simple dipping sauces.  The quality of the beef (especially the boneless short rib - kalbi) is excellent.  Definitely prime.  Upgrading to any kobe style cut is worth the added expense.  Incredible fat content that makes the thinly sliced beef cook in literally seconds for melt in the mouth tenderness.  Because of the fat what looks like a little food can quickly fill you up.  Don't over order and have the staff quietly snicker at you.  The beer really is super cold and makes for refreshing, 1
SERIOUSLY the best hotel in Scottsdale i stayed there and from the moment i walked in to the moment i walked out nothing but the best John at the front desk was social and very polite and a pleasure to talk with when i found out my room didt have a tub he upgraded it right away and had the bellman Brett bring me to my new room and he gave me a little mini-tour and the history of the hotel when we got to my room he made sure he showed me everything and how it worked best staff...the food was great the pool and spa omg just all around the best i already booked the tower for the next stay! you get what you pay for!!! best best best!!, 1
Seeing as how I was staying at PH it was only right I came here. Granted I didn't dine here, 1
Tried this place for the first time tonight.  Will DEFINITELY be back.  The basics that me & my hubby usually get at sushi places (tuna poke, 1
Eat N' Park is the place you go when you find yourself out with friends late at night and you're looking for a place to hang. I've found myself here after many such events - proms, 1
I came here yesterday after a long drive that had my appetite built up. I ordered baked kibbee with cucumber yogurt and also rice pilaf. Overall I thought the food was really tasty and worthy of a 4-star rating. I particularly liked the kibbee as it is certainly exotic and not something you can just find anywhere even among other middle eastern venues. The service was good too as my server was friendly and outgoing. The only minor issue is the location, 1
Honestly THE BEST salon I have been to in the many years I have lived in Las Vegas. Skaught Gibson runs a tight ship with some serious style. I tell him my concerns, 1
Dined with visitors from Tokyo who wanted a Japanese meal (go figure). We shared a few dishes including Jalape\u00f1o Hamachi which was very good and decent fried calamari. Then came the amazingly fresh sushi (where they get this in the middle of the desert is a puzzle) including some of the best uni I have ever had. All the fish was extremely fresh and tasty. Our visitors were impressed and the meal was a great success., 1
The hype is real. Is this worth a $20 cab ride from the strip? Come on, 1
Love those Irish nachos! Decent selection of beer and good food!, 1
Corey most certainly went the extra mile to make a sale for us on this house. He worked open houses, 1
Best omelette we've had in a long while.  The pancakes were amazingly fluffy too.  But the toast was terrible.  Almost as though it was from a week ago.  The service is impeccable.  The atmosphere is excellent.  And, 1
My boyfriend and I purchased two general tickets on Groupon for $49 then paid an additional $59 for an upgrade to VIP seating and two alcoholic beverages with a souvenir cup.  The Bar: I honestly don't think getting the drinks was worth it.  They don't check you for food or drink so you could easily brink in your own can of soda or water if you think you will get thirsty.  My boyfriend ordered a Pina Colada and it was the worst I have ever tasted.  I got the Tropical Bay Breeze which was weak but very tasty.  I had to pay another dollar for it though because it has Malibu in it.  Refills are $10 except mine which was $11.  They have you wait in this tiny bar area until the doors to the theater open, 1
One of the reasons I love coming to my mother's house is that it is close to suishi loca! Of course anyone can say that they have had better suishi, 1
Sunday brunch!!! We've gone here on 4 different occasions for Sunday brunch and each time we have been blown away!! They have a HUGE Bloody Mary bar and helpful bar tenders, 1
All in all its just fun pizza., 1
I love Korean BBQ and this place satisfied my craving.  Loved the wider selection of meats, 1
Delta isn't a 5-star hotel, 1
I was referred to Clarissa Boutique by a friend. The ladies were pleasant and helped me pick out perfect earrings and bracelet to match my dress and crystals on the neckline. The prices were very reasonable. They even sent me a handwritten thank-you note in the mail. I will definitely refer friends!, 1
I am have been a member of Fitness 19 in Oklahoma City for over 4 years and have always been very loyal to MY GYM!  I come to Henderson in January and stay 2 months. Every year the trainers and other employees at Fitness 19 in Henderson are very welcoming. For the last two years I have had a trainer for at least part of my stay which keep me honest!  But whether or not I have a trainer, 1
Delicious burger and great fries...the wait was a little long...but worth it., 1
This is my 3rd visit here. I got my first full set for a tropical vacation and didn't think I would keep them. I fell in love with them though and will continue to come back. I go to Master Artist Raquel, 1

Everything we've had here has been delicious! It's a certain type of food--if you don't like strong flavors and sauces, 1
On s'y amuse vraiment bien! L'endroit n'est pas exceptionnel, 1
I am an Absolue fan of Olive Garden, 1
Absolutely wonderful.  Highly recommend the steak salad - its marinated steak along with a bunch of other stuff. I'm not a big fan of salad, 1
Favorite was the Golubtsi: fantastic taste, 1
I brought in my mother's Cadillac several months ago for a relentless brake squeal on right rear. I also mentioned to Brian that the car may need a tune-up as I wasn't sure when my mother had replaced plugs. He pulled the tire, 1
I've never been to a place like this, 1
Great soup at a great price.  I go for the veggie soup normally, 1
Of course for this place you know you're going to get big portions.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable and after we were seated she started firing information at us but she was going so fast that I missed most of it.  The dining room was really nice but it is what you would expect out of a high end steakhouse. We ordered a soup and a salad to share.  Both weren't really worth the $10 each.  We had the porter house steak which was cooked perfectly and not disappointing at all.  The highlight was the side dish though.  The potatoes were excellent.  So cheesy and creamy and fantastic.  Needless to say we didn't take any of those home with us!  This was a good meal and the service was great.  I would return., 1
You have to try these.  They are open 24 hours and the sandwich is delicious.  They are very efficient too., 1
The customer service here was incredible! My friend and I decided to eat here during a layover. Our server, 1
i went on opening day and no wait. so i enjoyed my visit. the food was good and so was the service and the price was decent, 1
We wandered over early to what we thought was Skinnyz. To our very pleasant surprise this has changed owners. The food was great! We had the calamari app and it was really awesome. One of the best I have had. Then hubby had the salmon which was perfectly cooked. As chicken wing snobs I had to try the "famous" moochie wings and they were excellent.  We will be back! Loved the atmosphere. Small and not many tables., 1
I stumbled upon this place a few months ago and it truly is a cute place to spend the afternoon.   Don't Miss:  ***For the dog lovers: SHAGGY CHIC Check them out for an awesome dog groom. My pug gets a facial, 1
My daughter recently got married at the Mandarian Oriental and since she had seen their afternoon tea service was highly rated we decided to host afternoon tea for a number of the ladies attending the wedding (25 to be exact).  Angela De Cosmo is an amazing event co-coordinator.  The couple had been conversing with Angela over the past  7 months regarding their wedding and when we decided to have a tea party I just emailed Angela and she organized it.  Since we were having so many, 1
Let me start off by saying this: My first and only (so far) experience with XS has been with its definite highs and lows. So why the 5 star review? Because the lows weren't within the club's control.   So my 2 friends and I got pickpocketed while we were on the dance floor, 1
The food is good with a relatively wide variety of foods and dishes.  The quality is at best a 4 and the service is so so.   However, 1
Best Zumba in town ! So much fun, 1
Amazing salon/ spa I've been going since leah the owner first opened it . Love gettting my hair done and manicured :-) i have also got permanent tattoo makeup and lazor treatments from leah. I wouldnt go to anyother spa!!  very friendly staff and fantastic boutique! :-), 1
I love my counters and loved my experience with this company!! Great to work with and the installers were nice and helpful the day they were here. :) the pricing is strait forward so there are no surprises. Great company!, 1
As my mother observed at a recent outing to Hopdoddy to celebrate her 65th year on this planet, 1
Hey! It's Wednesday! What luck! Half of craft beer! More reviews to come on this place! I've found a bar in here with helpful friendly staff. I'll be back!... Bonus motorcycle parking!, 1
I was in town for a few days for a conference and wandered in to Citizens for lunch on the first day.  The food was pretty good, 1

Paradise is good. Wildflower is better. But there is no Wildflower in Surprise, 1
My gf and I spent a few hours starting a nice relaxing weekend here. She got a great French manicure from Tessa and loved it and we both got cuts from Emilio Armand. He did amazing work and was very professional and fun at the same time.  As for the salon, 1
I used to come here over 10 years ago, 1
MONDAYS! oh my god. amazing. best time ever. drinks are typically expensive but if you go at 10 and are a chick it's open bar til 11! try to get into VIP also!, 1
Awesome food! Fresh served everytime! My favorite is the Pad Thai and, 1
OOOOOORRRRRLLLLLHHHHHHHHH GAAAWWDDDDD. That's really the best way to describe what you will say if you eat one of their creations. Highly recommend the chocolate eclairs and the almond croissant. And even better, 1
As far as poke goes, 1
So I finally broke away from my usual today (dark chocolate) and tried the erable brule after many recommendations and I'm so glad I did!  It was bursting with maple flavour and the nougat chunks in it were a very welcome surprise!, 1
Amy C. I must thank you.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You were the last droplets of water in my canteen that got me across the desert and showed me safe passage through Las Vegas, 1
We've been coming here for a while now and it's always a great experience.  Right when you walk in and get seated, 1
PROS:   - My FAVORITES are the: Pot roast. Pimento Cheese appetizer. Mac 'n cheese. Collards. Deviled Eggs. Home made biscuits.  - The POT ROAST is phenomenal, 1
So the other day, 1
My wife and I went here let Saturday for our anniversary. Sat in the out side patio which was awesome. It was a little warm but not their fault. I think our servers name was Greg and he was exceptional. The appetizers were IMO phenomenal. Ahi was sliced very thin with a fantastic sauce and capers. As good as it gets. Also had prosciutto wrapped Ceasar. Also very good. Wife had half chicken and I had the new York. Both prepared perfectly. My only complaint was the size of the drinks. Small buckets for a big bucket price. Wife told me they have poker machines at the bar. Can't wait to go back., 1
My favorite thing about this place is that you can order half rolls for AYCE!  They are open late and they always seem to be busy.  In fact, 1
630pm on Valentines Day. We had made reservations at a resaurant downtown, 1

My family and I decided to stay here for the weekend and we were pleased with the accommodations.  Good size room which was like a condo; kitchen, 1
I found my new sushi spot in central PHX. Great service and location near the light rail. Had the gyoza for an appetizer which was good. Ordered the albacore nigiri and a crab mania roll which were both delicious and all the rice is purple!!! Don't let it freak you out as texture and flavor are great., 1
So if you know me you know I love beer! I really wish I was one of those people that hated beer sometimes but Dear God I love beer!! I think its in my genetic code to love beer from both sides of my family. I'll admit if it wasnt for the beer I'd probably never come here but kids eat free on Mon & Tues. that means what??? You guessed it more BEER for ME!!! I did the beer sampler and fyi the tea here is a ripoff just drink beer. BEER ONLY!!! Got it???!?!   I had the NEW Mahi Tacos: Chile grilled they are wrapped in soft white corn tortillas with homemade pineapple slaw and fresh cilantro. Served with black beans, 1
My favorite hotel when I stay in my favorite city . I don't need to spend $400-$500 bucks a night for comfort. Luxor is clean and comfy. I like the atmosphere, 1
Large store.  Great selection.  Not too busy, 1
Fiance and I wanted to take her aunt somewhere to celebrate her birthday...Beautiful day as always here in AZ so we wanted some outdoor dining...Found this place on YELP and WOW!! This place is so modern yet so relaxing, 1
For many years, 1
The service is always very fast for refills and everything else. Great choice, 1
Amazing place. I'm not even a huge gardener, 1
Absolutely the best Vape shop around! The owners are so down to earth and friendly.. I have been raving about them. Will never go anywhere else from now on :), 1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place for breakfast. They are always busy but I've never had to wait. The selection for breakfast is yummy!  I'd suggest this place to everyone!, 1
I went for lunch buffet and I loved it. The food was great and garlic naan was best! The ambience was lovely and the staff was friendly too. Well organized place and the best part was there were many vegetarian options. Me and my parents enjoyed our lunch!, 1
Hands down the best service, 1
Highly Recommend this Store Kevin and Ken were wonderful ! Delivery people were very nice. I cant say enough about the tempurpedic mattress dont believe the negative reviews. I am a disabled vet and my wife is also disabled this bed is a incredible piece of heaven ! So once again thank you Kevin for helping a veteran on  veterans day!  Mike W, 1

Solid Korean restaurant on the strip, 1
Updating my previous review.  It seems like Sam Ash has paid attention to these reviews. My last few times have been nothing but amazing. Total day and night experience. The employees were helpful and smiling. This is now one of my favorite places to shop., 1
Oh wow. LOVE is one of the most enchanting shows I've seen in my life. You know that feeling when you are giddy like a child and your eyes are big and you can't help but smile? Yep, 1
Fresh ingredients. They bake their own bread, 1
Bruschetta and Panini sandwiches, 1
This place is absolutely gorgeous. That is how I'm going to start every review that has to do with the new hotel Encore attached to the Wynn, 1
All you can eat sushi?  I was hesitant, 1
One day in Edinburgh and I've had enough "oh... You have a toddler... We have no tables tonight" to last me a lifetime. We stopped here on the way to another "family friendly" restaurant and never left.  Deceptively large, 1
Seeking a sour on tap?  Me too!  And Taste of Tops is one of the only places I can find a sour on draft in this IPA-soaked land.  They have 24 rotating taps, 1
I like the black lady that works here! She always make me laugh and she is always in a good mood!, 1
By far the best Todai I have ever been to. Love their poke. So fresh and the taste remained the same even after many months since I got to taste them again. Many different sushi to choose from and of course my favorite crab legs, 1
This place houses my FAVORITE meal in madtown... 3 CUP TOFU! This stuff is amazing!  White rice topped with a deliciously sweet and spicy sauce with tofu that is cooked to perfection with some amazing pickled vegetables on the side.  My boyfriend is a meat eater and this is always what he orders as well.  And we always start with the chips and guac. Seriously, 1
The Vegetable Sampler had an unusual collection of flavors. Bartender was knowledgable and patient with the wines. I ended up with a tasty local white. Computers available on the bar. Only problem was, 1

The best chicken and dumplings anywhere - absolutely anywhere!!  Friendly service - a place where you come back to for the people and the food., 1
I'm glad I finally made it to Joe's Grotto. I've been wanting to come here for a long time. Good place to catch a live band, 1
I really love this theater and here's why....  - Loyalty cups (used to be $1/refill but now $1.50 but I won't complain about a 50 cent increase when I'm still saving money) - Popcorn T-shirts (free popcorn when you wear it) - Military, 1
I came back last week for Happy Hour and totally enjoyed myself. The drinks were amazing and the appetizer was great also. The key for me, 1
Great fresh fish tacos and sandwiches, 1
Great sushi option right here.  All you can eat has a great selection of rolls and sides and apps.  Fish is fresh and the restaurant is clean.  We've come a few times near closing and they have always been friendly and welcoming., 1
I was referred to Coblentz by a friend, 1
Great meat and very friendly and helpful service., 1
I came across Verde Salon from a friend.  It was the best experience I have ever had!  I loved the fact that when I walked in there was NO odor.  Stephanie and her staff were the best and I felt like royalty.  The products used there were nothing I ever thought I would use but after the first try I was hooked.  My hair never felt so clean, 1
nice room in the hotel. I don't know how i feel about the location since it was super far from venetian and palazzo where our friends were at. The pool on the 14th floor gets ridiculously busy fast. The wicked spoon is good in there. the mins are higher than other places and the shopping wasn't that great. I wish they had more normal store. The room with balconies def made up for it in general and there is access to everything else on the strip so not bad. marquee is also there along with 2 more pools., 1
WOWZERS! this is the best pizza ive had in Phoenix. Or maybe even the USA (including NYC) - a very unique blend of cheese that packs a really good flavor, 1
I went to Rustic Sage for a massage last week.  Wowza......great, 1
I feel deprived if I go and don't get the Thai chicken pizza but lately I have been brave and tried some new dishes. (then I get my pizza to take home) The Ginger salmon is excellent. The miso salad is also yummy. Tonight I'm having the Greek pizza. My husband always enjoys the meat cravers pizza and my son gets the other salmon dish they have. He loves the little lemon "bra" they put on the plate so you don't squeeze seeds all over your meal. Plus the sourdough bread is great too., 1

My lobster salad sandwich was awesome....  Would definitely dine here again..., 1
Lava Lounge with worth checking out for the ambiance alone.  Go to here, 1
I moved to Gilbert about six years ago and was in search of a local coffee shop and much to my surprise this business popped right away.  It is tucked away in Agritopia right next to Joe's Farm Grill.  Don't let the name fool you because they have wonderful baked goods, 1
This may not be my favorite place to get Chai Tea Lattes (I prefer my chais powdered) but the staff (the guy with the beard) and the selection of teas is amazing! Its closer to my house than Crazy Mocha is and I enjoyed my visit. Plus there is free wifi!, 1
I have been to XS, 1
YUM YUM YUM!!!  I am only reserving a star for the extremely sub-par service that we received. The food here is incredible, 1
OK - we started the night and were in a bad mood - don't ask me why (MSG in our burgers?) ....and so we picked up our tickets, 1
This restaurant has recently changed its name from Blueberry Hill to The Blue Skillet.  The name might be different but the food is just as good.  My husband and I love coming to the Skillet for breakfast on the weekends.  It reminds us of the diners we used to love back home in the East.  My personal favorite is the chicken and waffles - it's soooo good!  The menu is massive - they have something for everyone.  Even picky eaters like me!    The servers are always super friendly and most of the staff is bilingual (Spanish - just in case ya need it!).  If something is wrong with your order, 1
Okay when it come to salad bars Sweet Tomatoes by far tops the competition such as Soup or Salad or your run of the mill salad bar. I usually go here with a buddy or two for lunch about once a week what's really nice is if you sign up for their news letter, 1
Really love this place for Thai food! Excellent and friendly customer service and delicious dishes. I highly recommend sitting in and getting the big pot of Tom Yum. I also really enjoyed the Pad Woonsen and their crab rangoons. They also have really good house sweet and sour sauce, 1
I had the pleasure of sitting on the patio and it was wonderful. Shaded by trees and seats were comfortable. I love the beef taquitos, 1
Took A lunch break and order a Shawarma plate, 1
Went for a quick dinner before a show downtown.  Had the Fez Kisra, 1
Before this visit, 1
I went with a group of friends after a night in Market Squae..   Please note they enfoce a dress code (simple dress code) - no tennis shoes and prefer a shirt with a collar.  We order our drinks. Pimm's Cup for the guys and a variety of Champagne assortment for the ladies.   (This is a full service bar with all the spirits).  The owner introduced himself after we first walked in.       The atmosphere - The bar is lined with sitting areas made up of modern furniture that you would see in your VIP secations in many clubs to promote conversation.    If you are not with a group of friends then this could be awkward.  We met a variety of people and had a great time.     Atmosphere - Dress Code (beware), 1
Bomb deal with their all you can eat sushi. So many dishes and rolls to choose from for $22 bucks. Would definitely come back. Highly recommend their soft shell crab., 1
This is possibly one of the best managed companies in the U.S.  Their chicken wraps, 1
I was directed to the colorist/ stylist Zoey through a friend of mine and it was the best decision I have ever made! My hair has been through hell and back since April. Read the Stylin Katts review, 1
Super friendly staff in a super cozy environment that makes you want to stay and hang out!  The barista made me a special watermelon mango Italian soda and it was to die for!  I enjoyed it with a greek pizza and was completely happy with my decision and the entire meal.  We ate outside on the patio with our dog and everyone enjoyed the evening.  I will definitely be back!, 1
Wow. The number of flavors of gelato That's Amore offers is truly impressive -- and all of it is delicious and made in-house! There are pastries and coffee, 1
Though we got off  to a bumpy start I must say that my most recent visit to the center was a pleasant surprise.  I found the staff to be warm, 1
tr\u00e8s bonne nourriture. tr\u00e8s bon rapport qualit\u00e9 prix. Ambiance convivial, 1
I haven't played bingo since I was in elementary school.  So I thought this would be funny to go and be like the only people under 75 in the room.  Holy crap!  THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU LEARNED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!  My friends and I decided to go play Bingo since none of us have.  We thought it would be just like school bingo and you would pay like a buck to play.  Oh hell no!  This is serious bingo!  And you don't just get your numbers in a row bingo.  You have to pay attention to what bingo they are playing.  And some of the games, 1
I can tell a clothing boutique has a great selection when it's ultra tiny, 1
Far and away the best dive bar I've been to. Nate is light years beyond any other person working any type of customer service, 1
The service & the food on this visit was AWESOME!  The only negative was how loud it was when the servers gathered 'round and hooped & hollered for the occasional celebration. Our server Tiki was very attentive & pleasant. We'll be asking to be set at her table next time we visit. We had refills on the table before we needed them & she even brought a kids refill for our little one - can't remember the last time that happened, 1
My first time ever at a skinnyfat and I was sold on this being my favorite and I can't wait to go back. I told the guy at the registrar it was my first visit and he was more then happy to explain the menu to my family and make recommendations. Sure enough we ordered 3 of the items he explained and they were amazing. The decor is unique and all the staff extremely friendly and I felt they all cared about the food, 1
One of my best friends in the world was having a birthday and I wanted to make it special for her cuz that's what I do. Since she insisted on a mint chocolate chip ice-cream cake I couldn't order one from a fancy bakery. Instead, 1
What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This place has tremendous food and will not drain your bank account. I tend to not be a big salsa fan, 1
Great old school bar. Burgers are fantastic. The service is good .the price point is good for Middleton. Will be going back again., 1
I have been here a dozen times for lunch, 1

Came back to my Molly after I got a full set somewhere else (just to try another place). But nope... I still missed my Molly and she hasn't lost the full-ness touch! And can I just say... I love brushing these mink babies! Softer, 1
Dr. Skabo is so awesome ! He is always pleasant and he is so down to earth ! The receptionist Stephanie is also super sweet and always smiling ! I love this place :), 1
Never been to the store since I live so far away. Did my transaction online. The people that work there are real nice. Sent them an email and promptly replied back. Shipping would have been faster if USPS didn't mess up. Not Pink Spot's fault. Will definitely be a repeat customer and maybe check out their store when I return to Vegas., 1
I don't need to say much, 1
Review for the weekend buffet only.  This place is friggin expensive for sure.  I would never do a proper meal here cuz the price scares me so much.  However..the weekend buffet is pretty good. Although the selections aren't as deep as Tamba or Gandhi, 1
Hands down the best Eggs Benedict I've had in Montreal.   Skeptically ordered the BAB. At first I was like: "Lemon in the bechamel?" But after my first bite, 1
Charming on the patio by the lake!, 1
Excellent job creating the pirate cake I was looking for. I submitted a design and they created a beautiful cake that was very delicious too! See the photos I posted.  I am recommending Caked Las Vegas to all my friends!, 1
This is one of the best breakfasts I have had! Is the decor dated? Absolutely but it just adds to the nostalgic charm! The place just reeks of beef cooking... Ahhh delicious! Check out the pastry cases!!!! OMG, 1
Good size neighborhood bar, 1
I love this place. It is one of our regular stops. We LOVE the Baja Sauce. I would put that stuff on everything. Baja Chimi is amazing. I also love the Fajitas. They put green chills with the onions. Salsa is also good., 1
The place looks amazing inside. It's the largest nail salon I've ever seen for starters. They do manicures at a bar/type set up. They have pedicure chairs with wash bowls that lite up w/LED lights- really pretty. & I think they have nabbed all of the best nail technicians from around town because everyone's nails looked fabulous and everyone seemed happy when they were leaving. The ladies at the front desk didn't think twice about letting me run to get cash from the Chase bank across the street because I was without a debit card & u can't put the tip on a credit card, 1
Had a great dinner! Just had the Cali roll and pot stickers. Overall the Sushi rolls looked very good. Our server was very nice however they only had two at the time of dinner. I will be back for sure, 1
Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and across the escalator through a long hallway you'll find one of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. We ordered the white pizza special with pepperoni and some sort of sausage and a mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were delicious! Total came out to $11 for the two pizzas. You can also use your Cosmopolitan Identity Players card to pay for your meal if you have enough points. There isn't really much space to eat inside but you can take your meal outside by the escalator where there is a nice lounge area with plenty of seating. You will find many people devouring their pizzas there! There is also a pool table you can use for free. We will be coming back here again!, 1
Terrific spot with great vibe. The iced coffee is one of my favorites being cold brewed, 1
Stayed here for my Bday. It is my kind of spot!  Pros: -non smoking -gym/spa was newer and well kept -our room was a full on suite with a lovely large bath tub -complementary water -centrally located -digging the decor! :) -proper concierge is a plus! -free Wi-Fi  Cons: -have to walk through Cosmopolitan to get to Vdara most of the time (not really a Con per se ... but after having a bit too much of adult bevies, 1
I have been here two times since I started working at UNLV.   The first time I went after work to get some spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. It was wonderful! A huge portion that really filled me up and left me with extra to enjoy the next day.   The second time I went, 1
This place is just a few blocks down the street from me. Yet, 1
I went here for some balloons and I didn't even look around at the costumes. I had called around trying to find the best price for some helium filled balloons for my Dad's birthday party and this place had the best prices. A big plus was that they also offer (for 25 cents extra) to put some kind of gel in the balloons that keep them from loosing their lift. I had to pick them up the day before the party so I really needed them to last. They were still floating 3 days later so that was pretty cool. They also had a HUGE selection of all different kinds of balloons. They did not have one that said "65" on it but they did have a Happy Birthday balloon that you could customize with any age. This was a pretty cool idea but unfortunately by the end of the party the 5 was peeling off (apparently they are stickers even though you couldn't tell when it was fully attached). So that was kind of a bummer and the only reason I am subtracting a star.  Check out their website for prices on ordering balloon bouquets to be delivered to your special someone. That's right, 1
What a fun spot! Came here on a Wed night out of the blue with the hubs & some friends. I have been wanting to stop in for quite a while, 1
Love this place. Yummy and great service. Hands down a fan, 1
A true off the strip gem. Amazing restaurants, 1
My wife and I have been married for 22 years now and we generally find picking a great restaurant that we can both agree on a bit challenging.   Pita Jungle is the first place we've ever come back to 3 times within 24 hours!!!  The food here is delicious - pretty healthy - and features a great blend of flavor combinations. My wife loves the salads and I'm into the Pitas, 1
Love this place! Always hopping and busy. Very quick and clean service! I get the straw on a onion bun. It's to die for!, 1
I have taken colleagues from Korea here and they believe it to be high quality Korean food. One guy said it was the best Korean food he has found outside of Korea (and he travels a lot).   I have traveled to Korea extensively and I always go here when craving Korean food., 1
THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!  A beer store where you can sip booze while you buy it.  Its great that they finally seem to be getting some business.  They deserve it.  I guess they had too many Harris Teeters in a small area and when this Lowe's foods shut down they wanted something there but didn't need another grocery store.  This place is a beer and wine mecca with some dry and frozen goods as well.  I went last week for a NC beer tasting and the bar area was slammed.  With a great selection of $2 bottled beer I can see why.  I waited a minute or 2 trying to get a beer and just decided to go to the tasting.  Reps from all over NC giving tastings of their offerings.  Most notably, 1
Let me say this was the best experience a first time shooter could have had. The service was quick and efficient not to mention very friendly.  They have this down to a science, 1
Had the chicken shwarma spicy with regular hummus and the pitas.  It was delicious!  Will definitely go back again.  Great place for a quick lunch., 1
Love it.  They have the traditional and completely unique pizzas as well.  Check out the Hungarian Goulash Pizza.  Their apps are great too and they actually make the ranch dressing so it's the bomb.  Clean and nice atmosphere.  It never disappoints and it's open late., 1
I have been to a bunch of steakhouses this is strangely my favorite! Outback never disappoints! I always have a great steak cooked perfectly. This location makes a great meal. They have a great steak. Great wedge salad. Great sides. Great blooming onion., 1
I love this place! Good food! Amazing deals and best of all, 1
I attended the Yelp Event here last week and had a great time! The owner and his primary bartender ("the mustache" guy) both had great personalities and kept the beer and cider samples flowing! They were also very knowledgeable about the beverages and displayed their expertise without sounding obnoxious.  I sampled five different beers and ciders but loved the Arsenal Cider Fighting Elleck the best. It really tastes more like champagne than cider which was delightful! I also tried a grilled cheese sandwich with a pumpkin cupcake made from a local bakery. The grilled cheese was perfectly melty and soft without being overly greasy. The pumpkin cupcake was moist and covered with a delicious buttercream.  The interior of the restaurant was much nicer than I had anticipated and elevates an establishment that sells beer, 1
This was my second time seeing The Lion King. The first time I was really young and don't remember much other than the fact that I enjoyed it. Second time around and many years later, 1
Second time here - this time with the Wife and Son. The wait for an awesome outside table (actually on the border of the inside dining room and outside patio) was terrific - great people watching spot and view of the Bellagio fountain. Great service, 1
Try chicken noodles, 1
This sleek little Italian place (formerly LV Grill) left my mouth watering taste buds a-tinglin'. All the ingredients are super fresh and many are imported from Italy. The pizzas are amazing: thin crust, 1
During the day, 1
I picked up take out here last week and it was amazing! They didn't take too long getting it ready and there weren't too many people in the restaurant. I tried the Tacu Bowl with chicken and it was such a massive amount of food! Lasted for two meals. The chicken was so tender; and the rest of the dish added a ton of flavor that I didn't need any sauce on it. My boyfriend got the stuffed quinoa avocados with chicken and that was amazing. They looked awesome. The sweet plantains were perfectly cooked and there were plenty to share between the two of us. This is definitely a place we will come back to visit!, 1
Great/cheap/fast breakfast. Had white chocolate chip pancakes... amazing!! Not sure why this isn't a common thing, 1
First of all I don't know where one reviewer got the idea that there is a cleaning fee here there is a "resort" fee which is basically standard everywhere in Vegas and includes fast wireless service. Everything here is so modern that if you want your room cleaned you have to press a light (which is hard to see) and the hotel should probably mention this which is why another reviewer likely didn't get cleaning service. Yes there are some oddities - the kitchen I think is more meant to be looked at than used but the free water is great and the rooms are large and very very clean. Our suite had 2 flat screen TVs - one in the bedroom and one in the living room and although the pullout couch is uncomfortable and doesn't "come with" linens the hotel will make it up very promptly as a bed if requested. The soaking tub was to die for I think I took two baths a day even though I felt a bit guilty being in the desert I couldn't resist. And I can't forget to mention the free valet parking! I think the thing that really distinguishes this hotel and which will most definitely bring us back is the lack of a smoky casino. If you want to be around drunk people chain smoking as you walk through your lobby every day go next door to Aria or anywhere else on the strip. And if you want outdated and stuffy styles go to the Four Seasons or the Bellagio. If you want a clean, 1
I went here for lunch on a work day.  I met my parents who brought my toddler so we could all eat together.  The waitress was friendly and patient with my toddler.  She brought out a sample of a sauce when my mother worried about it being too spicy.  We were in and out and I was back at work on time.   Now to the food.  I ordered enchiladas with avocado and artichokes.  My mother ordered cheese and onion enchiladas.  My father ordered chicken enchiladas.  All were delicious.  I especially loved my avocado and artichoke enchiladas.  They were fresh and tasty and I didn't leave with a heavy-feeling stomach.  The cheese enchiladas were also very good.  The black beans were very bland but the rice was delicious.  I would happily go back to this restaurant., 1

We love Winco! It's easy on the pocket especially on produce which has been good quality so far. Also Milk is always under $2 a gallon! I love all the different types of breads they carry and their HyTop brand products aren't bad.  We hate shopping at Walmart and supporting an awful company. Winco treats their employees well and have always had exceptional service. You can't compare it to Fry's or Safeway it's a hybrid! What really helps is that it's great for just 2 people, 1
I discovered this place because my church shares the same parking lot.  Yelpers here got it right: fresh and yummy food, 1
I have driven past this past this place 100's of times. I never thought to stop in here until I read about it on yelp. I ordered the combo (beef and chix) although I'm usually not a fan of beef at these places cause its usually chewy. Well, 1
I have to give it to these casinos in Vegas, 1
For the uninitiated, 1
D\u00e9cadent. Divin. Miam! Cela d\u00e9crit bien mon exp\u00e9rience chez Juliette et Chocolat! :P, 1
Have i mentioned this is my favorite Mexico City Mexican food joint?! W/out a doubt consistent, 1
An absolutely delicious brunch with honest food and eager to please staff. Youll definitely see me again., 1
We were her for lunch on 2/12/14. The burgers were really good and we had great service from Paul and Baily. Also met a couple from Canada while we were sitting there and just so happens the Canada-US Olympic hockey game was on the teli which made for our conversation. My family are locals and I am here every 6-8 months definitely will be back for the burgers again., 1
Love Ronald's Donuts. I once bought a few dozen for a work meeting and everyone agreed. Vegan or not, 1
place is the bomb, 1
Freddy's is a typical Midwestern style burger joint.  I'd say the closest comparison is Culver's.  The burgers although very tasty and not overly greasy, 1
The Mix Lounge has the BEST panoramic view of the Vegas strip. Yes, 1
I have been here for late night dining (4am) and brunch. What I enjoy are the generous portions. What I like -- design your own omelette and the clam chowder! I can not say enough of the clam chowder! Unfortunately, 1
Moved to the valley from Philly. Best cheesesteaks. As anyone from Philly will tell you, 1
Joy would sum it up.  Beautiful butterflies flying all around. Come for experience rather an expectation.  Four stars because it was fun, 1
Somehow this is the best American style food I've ever had.  I know that seems strange since I was in Canada!  It was late in the evening and a friend and I were walking down Sainte-Catherine and we needed a bite to eat.  It was pretty late so we weren't sure what we would be able to find.  After walking around taking photos in the cold wet weather, 1
I've gone to several Cirque de Soleil shows, 1
Great creative menu that changes often. Great wine list that is diverse and shows a lot of thought put into it. Great for outdoor dining. No wonder its been there so long., 1
It was a lovely day for a birthday celebration.  Freezing, 1
This is one of the best nail salons I have ever been to. You never feel rushed here and they take their time.  Lindsay does liquid gel which most salons don't do, 1
I will always go here when I'm in Vegas. The service was excellent. The ambiance was excellent. The best miso soup I've had. I ordered that, 1
Love this place.   Like many others have said before me, 1
I rarely give places 5 stars but I honestly cannot think of anything bad about this place. We had a reservation but they sat us immediately. The waiter was very attentive, 1
Amazing pizza only thing is secret pizza is better, 1
Food was awesome!  All five of our kids (2-12) loved it.  We ate in the dinning room this time and had sushi, 1
Enjoyed this MUCH more than I expected~~    Quite funny and the McDonald's bit was hysterical, 1
Oh yeah cheers for hopdoddy, 1
This is owned by the old original cook/owner of Tang Dynasty in Lincoln Square Mall. If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, 1
Il ne suffirait que de r\u00e9gler le service (plus qu'ordinaire) et ce restaurant m\u00e9riterait amplement un 5 \u00e9toiles. Pour avoir essayer plusieurs pizzas, 1
Five stars for atmosphere. I LOVED the inside of this restaurant. The wooden accents on the walls and the arrangement of the tables were perfect.   Our server was nice, 1
Lobbys is great. I give the establishment itself three stars, 1
Great pizza! Delicious pie with a crispy crust! Reminded us of our first time eating Rays pizza in NYC!, 1
With the price of food in Vegas this restaurant was very reasonable. The staff was extremely friendly even with our party of 35!! The food was pretty decent. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a decent priced and a pretty good burger., 1
Woah...PHX is soooo much bigger than my hometown SMF! Nothing wrong with that; just different :)  Flying in, 1
What can I say? This place is a must try. Everything is so fresh. The Pho is incredible. The office goes at least once a week and everyone agrees that this is their favorite restaurant. If you're new try what looks good. Look around ..the place is usually packed. I just started to ask people  around me what was good. I love the birds nest but have been trying new things on the menu. Try it once....you won't regret it., 1
Two words: sausage sub and sausage pizza.  Okay, 1
Went this past November 18th for our anniversary.  The food was great.  The service (Pabo) was awesome.  Thank you, 1
I am so happy that I found JSK .. My son kash is 3  and only been going for a few months, 1
Very good. Have been to many Mina establishments, 1
Cool place. It's never been ridiculously crowded anytime I've gone. Plenty of room to shake your rump on the dance floor without bumping into anyone. And personally, 1
This place is beautiful and the music was great. Played a lot of older hip hop and and a few of today's top 40s. The deejay also played a bit of techno/trans. Overall the music was great. The venue itself was amazing. All white, 1
I hadn't found a salon since moving here from Chicago. I live in Kierland but didn't want to try a lot of the snotty places. My boss told me I had to try her stylist Michael. She even made the appt. I was changing my style pretty drastically so I was apprehensive. I showed him a couple pics, 1
Hubs didn't get what he wanted to try because they were out, 1
Good portion lunch dish. Sashimi is thick and fresh. This is my new lunch spot.  Just stopped here for dinner.  Probably the best sushi dinner I have ever had for a long while, 1
So glad for this addition to the Hard Rock.  Pretzel Fondue is fab!  Prices are great...good service.  The decor is very rocker chic and the atmosphere enjoyable!  Wonderful menu selections and a great patio experience as well!, 1
I'm so glad this salon is still here! I moved away from this area four years ago and on a whim came back and voila! They were open! I got the works, 1
Been going to Bailey's for the last six months. It's an older crowd during the day, 1
32 Shea is a fantastic little place for a quick bite or you can sit outside and people watch for hours.  It is just about the best place in North Phoenix for less expensive food and a cool environment., 1
I give it 5 stars because I remember the porterhouse I had.  It was one of those steaks that I remember which means its good.  Its not cheap, 1
I love Postino because of their $20 wine & board nights! My boyfriend and I went last night and had wonderful service from Jenny! She was awesome! We shared the bella postino & olives for appetizers, 1
This is one of the few places that define Pittsburgh summers to me. Cool places to get some grub, 1
Not to shabby! Had a hot Latte with sugar free almond rocha syrup and a banana nut muffin. The one thing I love is the large selection of sugar free flavoring to choose from. Really laid back, 1
Call me a rebel, 1
This hotel is pretty much amazing. I love how great it looks from outside and the water show is fun to watch table side if you're dining in one of their many renowned restaurants. The rooms aren't that amazing in my opinion but everything is definitely high quality. Their pool is huge and looks great on a sunny day. They offer any type of gambling you may be searching for and have an endless choice in food, 1
I come here at least 3 times a week. My all time favorite sushi restaurant! Great food! Great staff!, 1
There are a lot of higher-end restaurants on the strip, 1
It's a small space, 1
I stayed here during the Thanksgiving season. One thing that annoyed me is that they don't have a bar specifically for you to hang your clothes on when you shower. In addition, 1
Vous pouvez y aller seul, 1
Awesome food., 1
At the time we visited this place it was not busy, 1
What? The waffles have chunks of sugar in them? What?!?!  This is officially the best place ever.  I never thought I'd love a waffle until I tried the waffles here.  You may be detered by the small size of the waffles in the showcase.  But really, 1
I can't say enough about this place! The food is always delicious. Great atmosphere. Great service. Today my friend and I split the mushroom pizza and the kale salad. SOOOO good!!! I also had the antioxidant juice which was amazing. Love it., 1
It's not just great Hawaiian food, 1
What to do after a strenuous hike with a friend  at Red Rock Canyon?  Go to Rachel's Kitchen and have some food to restore some strength.  After a hike on Monday, 1
Best coffee in summerlin!!!! I live in California but travel to vegas on a regular basis and this place is always on my list., 1
Sunday breakfast is a tradition for my bf, 1
I don't quite understand the reviews claiming that that they literally missed meat while they were in David Banns or that its fine for vegetarians but not for everyone else. Even before I was a vegetarian I didn't feel the need to eat meat breakfast, 1
Best doughnuts in Vegas !! Just sucks that they only take cash!, 1
Time Out is like a New York subway train: Every time I step inside, 1
I'm late to the game and can't really add anything that hasn't already been said, 1
I went to Morton's for dinner last night and was once again blown away. I ordered the bacon steak for an appetizer, 1
Amazing view, 1
This is our go to service center for the whole fleet of family cars. Managers Paul and David are both extremely helpful and involved in every job. I can't say that we love every Firestone location but this one is top notch., 1
We went to Giada for a nice birthday dinner.   The first thing you notice when walking in, 1
As a newcomer to broadening my food horizons, 1
Joining CrossFit Infinite Strength has undoubtedly been one of the best decisions I have made to improve my overall well-being. The facility is fantastic and the coaches are extremely knowledgeable. The coaches along with the other members create a community that will help you reach your fitness goals., 1
Bought a $99 Groupon here for a massage, 1
Do you like good beer?   Do you like a big selection of bottles and taps?   If you answered yes to these two then Aces and Ales is your place. This place is way off of the strip but if your tired of 3 foot margaritas and domestic watered down beers, 1
Nice brunch on a beautiful day.  The place was still pretty packed at noon (they close at 1pm).  We ordered the eggs benedict, 1
Live this place! My man an I come here all the time! Amazing food, 1
Another 4-5 star steakhouse.  My co-worker and I were out in AZ and I had asked for a one off style place to eat and the valet suggested this place.Food was good, 1
It was our first visit and we got decent service at the ordering station. I know some of  the other reviews rave about the friendliness, 1
If you live in or by planet Hollywood, 1
I can't even imagine going to that "green and gold" place again!  Super friendly and absolutely delicious sandwiches!    I ordered a typical turkey sub with provolone and it was made to perfection.  The fact that they slice the deli meat to order was the kicker for me.  The bread is perfection...soft and has great flavor.    Do yourself a favor, 1
I only got to spend a few hours in Edinburgh - we were visiting family in Newcastle and took a day trip to this wonderful city.  The place we spent the most time was at the castle and it didn't disappoint., 1
We ordered take out for the first time tonight and loved it, 1
Sometimes you can get the best manicure and pedicure from a Mom and Pop shop down the street. This is the case with Queen's Nails. I love them and look forward to going whenever it's time for a mani/pedi. The staff is very friendly and they always find time to accommodate, 1
Voted #1 Day Club in Las Vegas. Beautiful people all around, 1
The pizza here is way above par!  Wood fired pizza and it's very tasty.  Always packed and the pizza is very consistent.  If you dont like pizza, 1
Best Vietnamese food in Phoenix, 1
Love this place. They are still working out the kinks but the pizza is awesome. Try the handmade spicy sausage and onion rings., 1
It was crazy, 1
My favoutite korean restaurant in Montreal, 1
Pane Bianco somehow got even cuter.  Since the last time we were here, 1
Simply the best burger joint I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. The food was top notch, 1
Sooooooooooooo... my impressions for this place has changed. Whenever I come back here, 1
1. Really 3 1/2 stars 2. Everything looks better in pictures, 1
Best bread in the world, 1
PT's has a great happy hour and it is geared towards to people who work throughout the day. You can get all drinks half off and half off pizza at two different times of day.  The service is always fun and friendly. It is a local spot, 1
I was randomly driving around because I had nothing better to do while I waited for a flight when I found this place. Food was great, 1
Great out of the way restaurant.  Love having a restaurant not on the strip.  Awesome wine list, 1
Only place in Verona worth eating in my book (that's not the Epic cafeteria). Best meatloaf ever (a little spicy, 1
Great park, 1
Surprisingly nice. Get it? Surprise! Oh, 1
I got my mani and pedi here and it was a really great experience.  I loved kevin.   Yay I found a place to get my nails done!!!, 1
Here's a New York perspective (coming from someone who has easy access to Viet food in NYC) of this place.  In Montreal's Chinatown where you easily have 5+ Viet restaurants along 1 street, 1
Love their cupcakes.  The frosting and cake is perfection!, 1
We were here on Friday, 1
The Thai Ice Tea is a bit too sweet for me, 1
This vegas ramen hit the spot. It's out of the Vegas strip but definitely taste better than a lot of on the strip foods  Prices are typical ramen spot prices. But this is one of my faves I have tried.  Worth the drive. Some wait. Delicious, 1
A long time coming........................  The elusive Delux Burger.  I have driven by this place half a dozen times during my missions to Phoenix.  We always use to go to a gelato place near here.  I always wanted to stop in and try a burger but never had time or already had eaten etc.  My buddy Dave G. has sung this burgers praises and last night was the night I would get to sample it.  I wish I had done so a long time ago.  It was fantastic!  One of the best burgers I have ever had.  I walked in and placed my order at the to go counter.  I ordered a Delux Burger medium rare.  Total came out to just under $13.00.  Sounds a bit steep for a burger, 1
The food was outstanding!  We will definitely be returning., 1
LOVE this place!  Fresh food and they will make it any way you like it. I always ask for it well done, 1
I was starving and needed a Thai fix STAT-- found Krua Thai online and oh boy! Literally a block from my house. First time I totally missed it, 1
Love the Pablo Picasso, 1
I LOVE SITTING AT CONCERTS.  I think it's part of the contract of being in my twenties that I'm supposed to enjoy standing in a mosh pit five feet from the stage. 'Cuz everyone likes getting sprayed with the lead singer's sweat, 1
Got my natural hair pressed the other day by Tiffany and love it, 1
Great southern place, 1
Very busy restaurant.  They shuffle people in as fast as they shuffle them out.  We had a party of 10 and got seated right away.  Before I could take a breath, 1
Let me preface this review by noting this show also had the added talents of the band WAR, 1
I've been playing for a few sessions now and love it here. I'm on a social league and the refs call the games as such, 1
Excellent little diner. Don't overlook this place while in the Phoenix area, 1
I've had Bucca Di Peppo as catering before, 1
Oh boy... Had only I known what I was getting into, 1
Drive thru is slow  I always go inside when open, 1
I've been here multiple times, 1
Can't believe I haven't written a review yet!  So I live walking distance to Rum Bar so it's a staple in the neighborhood.  Rum is the name of the game and anejo wil be to blame.  There will be no rum and cokes in this place!  The owner, 1
Realy liked. Not great but VERY good and worth every penny. Location not great but good enough. Cheap buffet. Above expectation fitness room., 1
Amazing beer as noted by all. Award-winning selection and ambiance.   Not noted by most: no TV in the place! I absolutely love that there isn't a television drawing everyone's attention.  Otherwise, 1
We went to the Cafe Costa Rica on a Friday night, 1
Who can say buying a car is a great experience? Well I now can, 1
Everybody that is planning on visiting us in Vegas, 1
Review for BRUNCH only:   I thought this place was a great brunch spot.  Dined here with 11 other girls and we all enjoyed it.  Great ambiance, 1
Their hot subs are really good and almost always order either the grilled chicken or philly cheese steak foot long which is around $10.   They have almost everything you need to enjoy the game.  Sandwiches, 1
Nice local restaurant for breakfast or lunch! I've had breakfast several times and enjoyed the bacon/eggs, 1
I will say this...it was a commute to get there...but worth the drive. I love the whole concept of 'preserving agriculture' and growing all menu produce in the adjoining farm - and you can taste the difference - everything is fresh. While the decor was very lacking in its cafeteria style of service....the food made up for it - the burgers, 1
I love this place. I always get their beef bowls. It's inexpensive but you have to get there early or go late because seating builds up. Just remember it's location on the upper level of the shopping plaza. It's a popular place and they also have pretty good sushi rolls. When I get the beef bowl, 1
Yum! Went here on a Sunday night, 1
Gumby is not my middle name. Nor is "rock hard abs." But increased flexibility and strength rank high among my fitness goals, 1
Called them on a holiday weekend and repair guy was at my house within an hour. Very nice and super helpful. Answered any and all questions and AC works wonderfully now., 1
This is the main one in Las Vegas- this is where the local news stations film people dropping of their tax filing at the very latest possible time- convenient closing time. The line inside is pretty quick. The parking lot is very accommodating. Forms for passports and tax filing forms (during tax time) along with customs forms, 1
What really caught my eye about this place was the Mexican street food they offer. Their street corn is fabulous and highly recommend it as a side. The tacos are very good but not the best I've had.  Overall the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is very friendly., 1
We came to the Grand Wok for dinner before hitting the clubs at my bachelorette party. We had a party of 6 with no reservation (they only take reservations for very large parties) and got a table right away. The place has a great atmosphere, 1
I took my mom here for her birthday breakfast. Everything was great. The food was burning hot right out of the kitchen. The waitress, 1
I watched it with my family (6) on a wednesday night, 1
Sunnyslope's latest addition is an upscale steak and seafood restaurant, 1
Stopped in for happy hour during my stay here and wasn't disappointed!  Seafood tower was very fresh. After all, 1
Ann is fabulous and Phoenix glow is the BEST!!! My spray tan with her always turns out smooth and last for a good minimum of a week without any crazy blotchy fading. Ann is so great and professional and will cater your tan to the specifics of how you like it.  Definitely check her out, 1
Perfect embarkation point for The Forum Shops. Love that you can refill fountain drinks for free (I'll usually stop back after the shops and rest my feet while sipping on a couple more cups of Diet Pepsi).  I haven't had all the choices but the pizza place is good and I really like the lobster chowder joint.  Prices are high but they recently added a $1 discount on everything (except soda) for Total Rewards members.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to do the typical Vegas experience., 1
When I miss my sweet home Chicago, 1
Love this location it is very busy though.  Well I guess all QTs are.  I wonder why they don't just build an extra island of pumps when they build.  I also wonder why they don't add extra registers.  Overall this location is clean and convenient. I love the many choices of drinks and ice, 1
Talk about great customer service paired with sustainable practices. You'll get both when doing business with Clean Air Lawn Care.   They are a power team of two arriving in good spirits to bring goodness to your lawn. They offer fertilizing treatment throughout the year, 1
My yelp friends at work have talked about this place a few times & i keep thinking we need to try it out. My husband woke up this morning & said he wanted to make Blueberry cream cheese crepes. I told him there was this place i wanted to try that made crepes & we should go there instead, 1
My wife and I drive by one of the other locations to come here. The staff are friendly and the food is great. I take many clients here for an early breakfast meeting., 1
Really good Ethipian Food.  The avacado salad is a must try!  I have been twice in the last couple weeks, 1
Bouchon is a must for breakfast. It's not cheap, 1
Go early in the morning to avoid the after work crowd but there are hotties everywhere!, 1
I went here the last time I was in Vegas.  It didn't help my poker game at all, 1
2 words.... FUC*!NG Amazing!!! we had the Sage chicken Benedict and it was definitely more than enough for me and my wife. I also ordered a side of biscuit and gravy which was unbelievable but unecessary since we were not even close to finishing it since we were stuffed lol. The wait is kinda long but definitely worth the wait.  Hit up the bar inside while you wait. They have great hangover fixes., 1
3.5 stars rounded up.  Our first foray into Salvadoran cuisine.  Half the fun was working out what we wanted with our poor Spanish and the servers poor English.  We weren't very hungry since we had been to Lo-Lo's just a short time before.  The plan was to share 2 entree's between the four of us at Lo-Lo's and then finish our dinner at Guanaquito.  Well, 1
There is a review from the other day from a gentleman who states that he had to pay for dinner portion and received a lunch portion and had asked to speak to a manager ....etc. I believe his name was jay. I was present for that incident. The gentleman had ate his whole meal and then refused to pay for it. The owner did come speak with him and he stated he would tell everyone not to come there as he stood outside. The man was extremely rude and cheap. I am a regular patron and have NEVER been upset about a portion. If anything I bring some home. Dinner portions are all they serve Sundays. I have always been happy with my food at Thai 1st. If you are going to give a review it should be honest., 1
Great customer service at this location! The supreme pizza looked like it was made to be on a commercial it was perfect, 1
My favorite place to stay in Vegas. It's less frenetic that other hotels, 1
Possibly one of the most difficult courses to play in Las Vegas.  Especially from the back tees. Now it's a desert course but there really are no hazard nor waste areas where you can play your if you misplay your tee shot. So before you come to Rio Secco, 1
My partner and I were looking for a great vegetarian restaurant and came across burritville on your trip to Montreal, 1
Really good with good healthy options! I had the chikichimi which was wonderful! Came with fruit to finish tha job whaaaaaaaaaattttt, 1
Charlotte's NPR news station - 90.7 fm. Excellent local news coverage and be sure to check out Charlotte Talks at 9am weekdays, 1
Oh the sugar coma that I just woke up from. Is it possible to be hungover from sugar. So worth it though. This was once again another awesome event. Lindsey rocks as usual. Everything she touches turns to awesome. Thanks to the staff at LGO for hosting us. It started out a little crazy but once you figured out that the valet parking was complementary everything smoothed out from there. Stand in line for a little bit and then the curtain is pulled back and we are let behind the scenes of the bakery. Right out of the gate BAM here is some gelato. Much need cool treat and a great way to start. Very good. Even the flavors that I would normally not try were good like the peach. So I continue forward happily enjoying my cool treat when I turn the corner and enter the main bakery. Jaw drops and eyes pop out of head. I am six years old again. The room is filled with cakes and cupcakes as far as the eye can see. Then I see a sign with a phrase that I want tattooed on my butt, 1
This is maple heaven.   It has maple pastries and desserts, 1
I've eaten at this location twice and have enjoyed both visits. I've had the prime rib which was cooked to perfection and a sirloin with lobster and shrimp special. The lobster and shrimp where in a sauce that was a little too salty. The crowd here is generally in the late 40's+ so don't expect a cool hip vibe from this place. It's quiet and dark with a lot of warm colors, 1
great service today!  always great food..must try the sonoran dog! off menu, 1
Wow. Go now. For their food, 1
i've been to their dinner buffet awhile ago but this past weekend we checked out their brunch buffet  it was prettttttty damn good. we were disappointed that they werent going to bring out the crab legs til 4pm so we chilled there for a couple hrs until they brought out the crab. (you dont go to the bellagio buffet and NOT eat their crab legs)   we paid for the buffet+champagne...you get unlimited champagne until 5pm....  needless to say we were really buzzed, 1
My favorite bar in the 480. You can't beat the price of this place. Great service and a must see if you love dive bars., 1
Great subs and service.  Kathryn at the register is awesome.  Super nice and efficient.  Get in and out, 1
The Vdara is a new sleek and modern hotel located slightly off the Strip adjacent to the Bellagio. What makes this a superb hotel, 1
I pretty much lived on this stuff for a year. The service was always great and the prices are good. The veggie nachos are great, 1
I took my mom to Crema Cafe the last time she was in town after a co-worker recommended it to me. Oh man. I am so glad she did!!!  We got there around 8:30 on a Saturday morning and were able to order quickly & get a table. A line did form at the ordering counter soon after we arrived, 1
I really liked this place! My boyfriend and I went on lunch as I have become addicted to boba. I've always loved tea but boba has become my new addiction. My boyfriend got the peanut butter banana smoothie with boba and I got the lychee black tea with boba.  The service was quick and they were friendly. I didn't realize that this place was in a mall so parking was kind of hectic. We walked in and found the store fairly quickly and ordered our boba. The placed seemed very busy compared to the rest of the mall! We waited for about 6 or 7 minutes before we got our drinks and started walking around the rest of the mall before heading back to our car.  I like lychee and I like lychee flavored things but this drink was just too sweet for me. If you LOVE lychee, 1
Dropped in for a burger today after noticing this joint recently and checking the previous reviews here.  I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that I really want a little local joint like this to be successful.  If the grub is good, 1
Redhead Tidbit: Asians and Africans do not carry the redhead gene. In fact, 1
Service was great and food was fast and delicious.General Tsos chicken was great but but spicy as it is marked on menu., 1
Based on some of the reviews, 1
Family owned and operated. Nobody works on commission!, 1
I can't say much about their spa, 1
The pizza here is delicious. Total New York style not a lot of crust and you are able to add different kinds of toppings. Lots of other varieties of entrees  as well, 1
Playing tonight with Cee Lo... just before Tiesto!, 1
We went to the Feast buffet for Christmas dinner with some friends. Other than the line the experience was great. The food was fresh and delicious all around. Back to the line though....1.75 hours to get in at around 6-630 PM Christmas night. Our servier said that was the shortest duration she had heard to that point when we were seated around 8 PM. Yikes! I didn't take the line into account since it was Christmas and I've never seen a line like that there in other trips to Red Rock., 1
The only TRUE BBQ available in Las Vegas. I have eaten BBQ (true, 1
It had a small theater, 1
Huge huge selection of any kind of alcohol you could want. Individual bombers of craft beer, 1
This place is seriously the best place to go for boba. the boba pearls are always fresh and warm, 1
Great find in Madison! We ordered the ahi tuna, 1
We had to get some big passenger vans for a group trip.  Looking up rental places in the area both near and away from the airport there was not many goood reviews so we just had to pick one and go with it.  They were not the nicest vans in the world but probably because they don't get the churn like rental cars where they sell them after a while.  Other then that, 1
What's wrong with me!? I haven't update this review when it has so clearly earned it's way up to a five star establishment, 1
I haven't eaten at Jason's Deli in a few years, 1
Went here for lunch.  Cute place in a strip shopping center.  I ordered off the AYCE menu.  The sushi was delicious and fresh.  Parking can be tough and we had to park on a side street.  I would guess that some people might be using that lot to park for UMC.  Restaurant wasn't too crowded.  Servers were helpful and friendly.  The service was a little bit slow, 1
$12.50 for a massage!??!?!  How awesome is that?  Yeah, 1
Great Place to eat and they have a lot of healthy options.  We had pizza when we went and it was above average.  The Gluten free crust is actually in my opinion there best crust; so give it a try.  We brought our children and they enjoyed themselves and loved the pizza too.  One Piece of advice, 1
This place was awesome! The portobello burger was so good. I love that they fixed up that area...this is just what it needed., 1
Great Sushi all around. Their fried rice is the best I've had. Service is really slow though even when moderately busy.  That cost them a star. I will return for however for round two. Hopefully they read their reviews ':-/, 1
My fianc\u00e9 and I stayed in Vegas for the weekend and we wanted an awesome breakfast not in the hotel. We yelped this place and it had 4 1/2 stars so we tried it. It was packed! 15 minute wait but we sat outside. Awesome food! Would definitely come again!, 1
With a city like Las Vegas with all the flashing lights and glamor and food prepared by a guy who's name you cant begin to pronounce it's very simple to overlook a place like this.  FIVE FRIGGIN STARS If it wasn't for other Yelpers i never would have came across this place.   The place is nice very clean very casual diner type environment.  The food is a bit pricey but that's because portions are HUGE and the fact they offer half orders is awesome. This isnt fast food so dont expect to be in and out in a heart beat they actually take time to COOK your food not just heat it up.  Ox Tail - Very nicely cooked lots of tendon and VERY tender WIN Fried Chicken - Came out hot fresh, 1
Mmmmmm .....  That is all I said after a single bite of this luscious goodness that melts in your mouth with tons of flavornoids delivered straight to your palates!  This is a must! Do come here at least once if you are in the area! Chipotle Chicken is the one you want! Montagu is alright...:/, 1
Reuben of the gods.  There, 1
wow. in n out... take a back SEAT baby!  These are some seriously good burgers man. there was a sign on the window that said "the best 5 bucks you can spend on a burger." i would have to agree. for starters, 1
First time staying downtown so had no clue what to expect. Typically stay on the strip when I come to Vegas. Downtown Grand was honestly the best. I was completely impressed with this hotel from beginning to end. Every employee was friendly and helpful. The casino and hotel were basically spotless. Our room was all the way up on the 20th floor. Hotel gave commentary ear plugs but never used them. Only heard the neighbouring rooms rarely but spent little time in my room. I MEAN IT'S VEGAS WHY BE IN THE ROOM AT ALL! I gambled a good amount on the roulette and call craps tables. Workers running the tables were really nice. Actually first time playing craps and they helped yeah me how to properly play. I'd stay at this hotel again. Recommend it if you want to stay downtown., 1
So delicious! We went for Father's Day to treat my husband to dinner.   Service was great. Attentive and so friendly.   We wanted to try a bit of everything so we ordered to eat family style: Margherita Pizza, 1
I wish there were 4.5 stars because there is nothing that China Poblano did wrong at all to not deserve the full 5 stars.  However, 1
Really a nice menu and good food, 1
FUN. TASTY.   Usually, 1
two words: fois gras.  Yummmm, 1
Loved the atmosphere of this place. You can either sit outside where XS is (I wouldn't advise this if your reservation is late and the club is starting up..) or inside where you can look towards it.  Staff is super nice and apologetic (they dropped my butter knife on me 2x. it's all good! shit happens!). Really liked my food..Had the Hudson Valley Foie Gras w/ a pineapple financier. The pineapple financier was weak and forgettable but I love foie gras and it was seared beautifully.  The bone in rib eye w/ chimichurri was very tender and tasty.. My dayboat scallops were also delicious but the potato cake underneath just tasted like a tiny hash brown.   Still, 1
Great brands and products. Have to search a bit on the weekends. It can get a little busy, 1
Probably one of the best buffets in town when it comes to food quality, 1
yum! our first stop when we arrived at Vegas. My brother has lived there for 30 years so he knows the places to go to. The food was great and I loved the 100 calorie margarita! Maybe my favorite Margarita ever, 1
My wife and I go to Vegas once or twice a year, 1
This review is for the comedy club only. I do not think they have their own page. However, 1
Visited this store for the first time last week and Im hooked!  Very attractive and nicely laid out with a wide variety of merchandise at fair prices.  My only complaint is that they wrap your purchases in used newspaper instead of the plain wrapping paper all the other antique stores use and when I got my vase home I had to wash it to get the black newsprint off of it.  That's something I expect when I shop at Goodwill, 1
very good sushi over at Ra on Mill. The food is why i went and that is what i am basically rating right now. Sat at the bar, 1
We are local and had to stay at a hotel due to a house emergency repair. We were very pleasantly surprised about how comfortable and welcome we felt at this hotel. All of the staff is super friendly and the food at the bar and restaurants is amazingly good!  Beds in the rooms are super comfy and we enjoyed hanging at the bar after Coyote game!  Definitely a great stay and would recommend to anyone needing to stay in this location...close to great shopping and sports activities, 1
Dr. Beals is fantastic!  I have had all 3 of my kids 4 wisdom teeth each-- removed within the last 30 days! Also one kid had 2 baby teeth removed and anchors attached during the same surgery.  Beals is great with pre op instructions and followup.  The kids liked him.  The girls up front are awesome... No one likes surgery ... but we recommend Dr. Beals!!, 1
This place is dope.  A really fun place to have drinks and grab a bite to eat.  I got the hot vings at happy hour, 1
Am I a poor college kid? Yes. Was I willing to splurge on beer and white truffle oil fries at Brasserie V? Hell yes.  With one of the widest selections of Belgian beers (and obscure, 1
um... two lobsters with noodles for only $19, 1
We have dined at BJ's several times and have always been pleased with the food.  Our favorite is their Happy Hour 1/2 off pizzas in the bar area.  The portion sizes are large and are great to share or take some home!  It is kid friendly whcih is a bonus for us.  We also really like the new smaller bites menu, 1
M & M was the highlight of our recent vegas vacation.  we used to live west of this place, 1
Yelp helped us find this little gem on our way out to California.  After visiting NOLA in December, 1
While waiting for somerhing we end up walking arouns here. Its a nice plave to just walk and be peaceful., 1
I've lived in the valley for 15 plus years and can't believe I hadn't been here before. I hit it up Saturday around noon to find it quite slow. This worried me a bit because most other places (Matt's Big Breakfast for example) are still jumping. However, 1
Food is decent, 1
Machaca Chimichanga -- awesomeness. One of my favorite two Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix Metro., 1
Had a delcious beet salad with the "Ingo's" lightly battered chicken delight, 1
Great  workout clothes for almost EVERY size. I'm a bigger sized woman and they had my size! I'm not shy about asking for the extra large, 1
OBSESSED. For realz.  I can't get enough of these juices! And you know what the best thing is? IT'S ALL FRESH! Like straight up from fresh local produce to their press and into a bottle. How much better can you get?  I'm telling you, 1
So you get what you pay for. If you pay for a suite, 1
I was nervous when we got there because the French place next to it was packed and this place was pretty empty.  Yet, 1
I had a great experience. As a dude, 1
It's little name barely describes the huge ambience and flavor this place has.  Skeptical because the previous two business which previously came and went, 1
Just went here last night. We happen to live on the opposite side of town but we wanted to try a new dog park for our miniature pincher. This park is Huge! And really nice. Lot and lots of green grass. If you have a small dog it can be challenging spotting your pup because the park is simply that big. But it's a really nice and extremely clean park which we all liked! Will definitely take our pup again. Wish it was closer to us tho.   - Joe, 1
I met a friend for breakfast. We both ordered at the counter and then took our number outside. Great location, 1
Stopped by this place over this past weekend for lunch. Parking is not ideal - you will pretty much have to valet park to eat here, 1
With so many places to eat in Vegas, 1
I pay almost $120 month in fees for our family of 5 but it is sooooo worth it.  Just the two hours per day of free childcare for my 3 kiddos is worth it.  I love the group fitness classes, 1
Endroit parfait pour un diner d'affaires. Le service est impeccable, 1
I can't stop thinking about the french fries! I think they were batter dipped prior to frying.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was good. Good size menu with something for everyone. Large open style, 1
We've been to many shows in Las Vegas and I have to say this show was one of the best.    We paid for two other couples from Texas and we all enjoyed it.   The food was better than I expected which is a plus for them. Our group had one person for at least one if the entree's.  I especially enjoyed the checked.  The dessert was blah but over all we had a great time!, 1
Great food and wonderful staff. A lot of places you go in and you get greeted by a grumpy old person. Everyone here was happy and jolly. It puts you in a great mood to enjoy their delicious pho. If you're looking for a good pho restaurant to go to. You def gotta check these guys out!, 1
The Kang Gai soup is wonderful!, 1
The service and food exceeded my expectations. The restaurant is very quaint and beautifully adorned in purple hues and cute decorations.   I love how the menu is split into sweet, 1
still, 1
I haven't read any previous reviews as I don't want to be influenced.  We were very excited when we heard Sammy's was coming to the vacated former-Applebee's location 5 minutes from our home.  We went to Happy Hour on Friday.  It was crowded but we still got 2 seats at the bar.  First, 1
Been here only a couple of times, 1
There's an old saying, 1
Went to Fin before seeing LOVE. Really beautiful place, 1
I was born and raised in the Phoenix area and I always laugh when people make comments about the "quality of Chinese food" here. Are you kidding? At this moment there are more people of Chinese descent in the San Francisco airport than in the entire State of Arizona. You aren't going to find the same food here as you will find in places like San Francisco and Vancouver. It's simply not going to happen.   But, 1
I don't normally like to share reviews without giving some critique for improvement. So... Matt's Big Breakfast- amazing food, 1
Aside from the Palace Station Hotel itself, 1
Our family enjoys eating here. They have a friendly staff. Our usual is a 16" pick special (best deal around) Black Olive, 1
Play in a hockey tournament here every year or so for the past 10 years and the facility is always clean, 1
Of all the times we've been to vegas, 1
We met friends on a Sunday so we waited in the bar, 1
Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I go there every time I visit.  Last visit wasn't as great because the food wasn't as well-prepared as I'm accustomed to there, 1
I come here at least once a week. Shocked to read the reviews, 1
It's fun to visit this store once in awhile.  If you are a fan of M&M's, 1
I used to live down the street and their all you can eat fish on wednesday and friday nights is wonderful.  The all you can each chicken on the weekends is also wonderful.   I've gone back over and over again.  Now I live on the other side of town and will still drive the distance for the great all you can eat specials.  1 bad thing about this place is the hours as it's not open most nights., 1
I absolutely love Under the Stairs, 1
Yes I know Macayo's is a chain....but I like it...so sue me!  They do a good job with the classics and it is fairly consistent.  I go there for happy hour once a month with a group of people, 1
Delicious! I had the pierogi and my husband had the hunters stew. Great service and food.... Just a bit pricey, 1
If you're looking for the best cupcake you've ever had, 1
Babbo Has good happy hour appetizers and drinks. We were having such a great time drinking and appetizers on the patio we never actually had dinner - so pretty a great evening.   Best Apps were the Firecracker rolls and the stuffed Mushrooms.   Great place for large group, 1
This place is awesome. I don't even think awesome covers it.  They do start swim classes/drills at 4pm. That's when it gets chaotic. Children 2-3 years old are $1 for swimming, 1
A 4.5 star restaurant for sure!   Good thing i made a reservation.  I was able to secure a seat by the bar at 9:30pm last Saturday night.  Yes, 1
$8.99 for their lunch buffet which includes all you can eat pizza (multiple varieties), 1
Well I have to start by saying I've never reviewed any type of business on any of the Internet review sites. I have however eaten at restaurants all over the valley for the last 28 years. I have been to copper still 4 or 5 times each time I've left satisfied and happy with my experience. Tonight I was with my 10 year old nephew after a basketball game and we had an unbelievable experience. There was a woman at a table near us that I watched throw her food, 1
I've been to this location a number of times, 1
If you brought nothing but the clothes on your back to Vegas, 1
This is THE Dairy Queen in the Madison metro.  Notice how the Sun Prairie location has no reviews....because nobody goes there.  Anyway, 1
Vintners rules.  The room is beautiful.  Reminds me of a chic, 1
It was a friend's birthday outing and they chose this spot. I was a little skeptical of course because out of all the years I've lived in Phoenix, 1
This is some of the best Chinese delivery I've ever had, 1
Yummy! Great vegetarian options and great service. They're rice and beans are only so-so but I just use that as portion control. I can't wait to try all their specialty salsas!, 1
Wonderful place. Great service. Honest work. Can't say enough about them. So grateful I was referred to them., 1
As far as fast food goes, 1
08.31.14  Live music. Happy hour. Watching the sun go down.  What's not to like?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jade-bar-paradise-valley?select=s2hd0fbtVP5F4N4dmx9fCA#s2hd0fbtVP5F4N4dmx9fCA, 1
My friend and I ate here before going to see the magician Jan Rouven.  What a great, 1
Last year gave it a 5. This year downgraded because noise level was so high. Tom Kha Gai was superb. The special was a crispy Mako Shark. Very good even though I'm not a fan of crispy. The presentation was excellent. Top notch service. Uncomfortable bench booth seats, 1
Went there for lunch today, 1
Can't wait to try more from their menu!  I needed appetizers for a gathering after work.  I ordered the Four Dip Combo:  Tzaziki; Hummus; Lebni; and Melizanosalata.  The Melizanosalata with roasted eggplant, 1
Aside from Church and home.  The HFA and BMC are my third home.  I've learned so much from the music program, 1
We were mall walking and stumbled upon Kona Grill one evening. It was a party of 8, 1
There is no bar, 1
This neighborhood branch library has been updated. It opens onto the street not the back of the parking lot now. It has a charming little outdoor walled nook to read on days it's not too hot - a wonderful touch. The update devotes roughly 2/3 of the space to Internet access or social gathering spots - one each for children, 1
Great food and service! The owner actually goes around and makes sure that everyone is satisfied! We ate at a few buffets but this definitely surpasses them! Best we had out here on this trip :-), 1
I had the Strawberry Dividend with Chicken (salad) and Chicken Fingers.  The salad was huge with good strips of chicken in it.  The chicken fingers were the best I've had in a while.   I'm glad this place opened near my office as it gives me another good lunch spot., 1
Because I can go here after work, 1
Went to this location to watch an ASU game and just hang out with some friends. Ordered the blackened chicken flatbread and it was great. Just the right amount of spice so my nose didn't run. My favorite part was watching the more "seasoned" men stare and the waitresses with no shame. I will definitely be back to people watch and have some beers!, 1
Love this place! They always remember us and the food is real awesome Italian food!, 1
Eating food is an experience, 1
Good burrito w fresh ingredients. Nice and spicy, 1
I am SO ecstatic that my favorite ice cream shop is BACK!! =] ...not in Vegas, 1
Henry's Cellar is small. But not in a cramped, 1
Possibly some of the best enchiladas I've ever had. Too bad Cirque has a strict no food / no drink policy. Damnit.. The sauce was just rich with flavor and the food was hot and fresh. We just don't normally get that kind of Mexican food where I grew up. Oh well. Looks like we have to stop in again., 1
I need to kick myself for not writing a review about this place earlier. If you're looking for a pheNOMenal sammich in Sin City, 1
My wife and i did the tastes from around the world thing, 1
They make a strong Americano!  Really good choice if you like dark, 1
Home to good microbrew tap specials, 1
Fantastic customer service. The store manager Jason was very friendly and a straight shooter. Went in for an oil change and it took less time then I was quoted. Very cheap oil change compared to other places.  The only silly negative I can think of is that they had the tv show Doctors on in the waiting room and that show blows. Very comfy couches though!   I would come back for anything car related., 1
I have been to this place twice so far, 1
Love Chino Bandido's! Great food that you can't find anywhere else! The combination of Chinese food with Mexican food is truly genius. And the fact that you get a snicker doodle cookie with your meal is a plus! My favorite is the jade red chicken burrito and jerk chicken quesadilla., 1
Nice pools, 1
I recently came here to grab lunch with a few friends.  We had a nice time and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Good food- we got a few entrees and split them to get a mix of things.  Overall, 1
I have been nothing but impressed and more than satisfied with the services provided by City Center. My priorities for finding an ideal storage location were convenience, 1
Yea I'm a fan. I had the apple sausage waffles. Delicious., 1
This was my second visit in less than a week's time, 1
I recently found out I am allergic to soy.  What does this have to do with bread?  Once again, 1
O Boy, 1
Just finished my first class here and I was pleasantly surprised! I was nervous about trying a different studio (I normally practice at Bikram Yoga Institute but I bought the Groupon for BYP), 1
I've been tattooed by almost everyone at The Golden Rule, 1
Been going to these guys for 2 years now. Theyre great at what they do! Both Victors are very nice and very patient with their customers.  You know that saying "customers come first" I think they live by that rule. I wouldnt feel comfortable taking my beemers any where else. I have 2 3series e46 and an x5. They always do a good job and thoroughly explain what they've done on your vehicle.  So glad I found this place! !!, 1
Went here again last weekend.  It was a spur of the moment choice!  The service was terrible this time around.  But the dessert wine was awesome.  Definitely try the 2006 Late Harvest Semillon, 1
Pretty darn good, 1
This place had the single best milkshake that I've ever eaten in my life! Who's ever though of a Nutella, 1
This is my first shooting range ever, 1
Yum yum yum!!!!  This is one of my fav Clt restaurants!!  The service is absolutely the best!!!!!!  Anything goes.  Whatever you ask for, 1
Went back to Bacchanal on 11/03/12. I was here 1 month ago and though the buffet is excellent, 1
I cant really fault Indigo Yard. I'm an absolute fan of their carbonara variation with chorizo instead of panchetta. Well played! Highly recommended.   http://smgdesigns.co.uk, 1
Dear reader, 1
Oh my goodness....YUM!  Our party of 5 split 6-7 rolls and they were all delicious.  The most delicious being the baked lobster roll.  We were all fat and happy at the end.  :), 1
Touristy? Yes, 1
Swanky kind of place which is located inside Luxor. Love their motif. Very classy, 1
Excellent happy hour tacos to fuel a day of bike riding. $2 tacos and endless chips served by friendly staff, 1
We got the spicy chicken combo and the "big buford" combo.  We used coupons and were able to pay $2 for the chicken combo and $4 for the "big buford" (normally 4 and 6 dollars respectively).  The food was fresh and pretty good.  The service was great.  If we had to pay full price for the food we probably would have felt shorted.  The small fries were small.  The sandwiches had a decent proportions for the price we paid.  The quality and taste of the food was about par for a good fast food joint.  The fries smelled like they were fried in the same vat as the fish but this was not reflected in the taste.    We walked up to the window and the food prep area appeared clean.  I would not have paid full price for this food due to the amount of food we received., 1
Cyan at Au Premier is fantastic !, 1
My husband and I stayed at Vdara over Thanksgiving. We have stayed at the Bellagio for years but the appeal of a non-gaming hotel was too much. We did not regret our choice.  The room was spacious and well decorated. The room's color scheme was very complimentary and modern. The bed was comfortable. My only complaint is that they only had down like filled pillows. I prefer foam pillows. The furniture was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. We did not have any issue with noise, 1
Phat Phrank's has quickly become my go-to place to tasty Mexican here in Vegas. It's a family owned place where the food is made with a lot of care and I love that! "Phrank" is always around and smiling and his staff will do all that they can to ensure your satisfaction. At this point I've tried quite a few things... my favorites:  *Nachos - I'm actually not a nachos person, 1
We took an amazing sunset hot air balloon ride during the Christmas Holiday season. The weather and view couldn't have been better. We saw10 balloons go up with us.Taylor our pilot was great and the ride was very smooth. The champagne toast at the end was a wonderful touch., 1
I highly recommend THEhotel at Mandalay Bay.  Yes, 1
*original review, 1
BEST PEDICURE I'VE HAD IN YEARS!  My girlfriend and I were visiting Charlotte in October for her birthday and we stopped here as it was closest to our midtown hotel. We absolutely LOVED it. Michael gave me the best pedi of my life, 1
If you sneak into the bakery before or after the lunch rush you can snag a cinnamon roll. These are the best cinnamon rolls I've found in Phoenix. They aren't subtle. There is often enough frosting (not the creamy kind) to put you in a sugar coma. The staff are polite and quick. Don't forget to tip!, 1
Great tasting amazing portions for the little price you pay they have a scale on 1-10 on spiceyness and the pad see ew is on point one of my favorites in town now !, 1
Went here while on a trip to Montreal. The escargot was wonderful, 1
I just ate here today and let me tell u.. It's really good we got the sizzling sisig and it had an egg on it.. I've never had it with an egg before but I like it.. We also got Pancit Canton Bihon I loved it.. Also the Tonkankatsu out some shit was fried just right, 1
Again can't eave enough about how great this place is .... Great customer service on a busy Saturday night the owner stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed.... Food spectacular I will be spreading the word...Great BBQ has arrived in CLT......., 1
I love this place! The folks who work here are extremely friendly - they remembered me after just a couple of times going in! Definitely try the pomegranate-raspberry and the oatmeal cookie flavors. Some of the best flavors of any yogurt place I've been to!, 1
Lotta haters on here but every time I've been to the Nascar my experience has been pretty good.  They've got Newcastle which was cool and the food is more than decent.  It's a bar, 1
Hmm...yummy coconut curry with chicken is defintely one to try here.  This is place has good Thai for Madison.  Another favorite place of mine that has never let me down either in price, 1
I have had no poor experiences while riding Megabus and have nothing but positive things to say about the company. The bus stop is located at the Convention Center and has covering in case the weather is bad, 1
Although it does not really prepare my favorite type of pizza (New York style), 1
its only because more people need to find out about yelp that bily kun hasnt been reviewed yet.  this bar is damn cool.  like maybe youll find yourself in the midst of a raid and have to fly out the back door (if there was one).  like you might come up to the long tall black wood and brass bar and the bartender might say "whatll it be friend" (although thatd all happen in french).  like from some back room a dark heavy silhouette named vito corleone might tell you to join him for a plate of linguini and clams (for the last meal of your life).  Bily Kun, 1
As chain restaurants go, 1
As a Minnesota native I've had the pleasure of seeing my Vikings reach four Super Bowls. Well, 1
I lucked into Scotty via google reviews. . .He was easy to get ahold of and prompt in getting out to our house.  Our pool looks gorgeous, 1
Second best sushi in Pittsburgh after Umi. Great uni and eel. Would recommend the sushi and sashimi over other dishes here., 1
Everything I get with the Trader Joe's name on it is great. Prices are great. Service is great. What can I say, 1
Tricks just keeps getting better and better. I have gone here frequently over the years and our last three visits have been wonderful.  The most recent, 1
I got my tattoo done at Lady Luck back at the end of November, 1
I loved the sandwiches at the Mesa Capriottis, 1
i went here for dinner with my friends..it is an awesome restaurant..i love it..the staff are very friendly and they recommend all the good things...i love the foie gras especially...the kobe beef tendon was also nice. the fish i guess almost all of it taste good..the crab also very delicious..everything is super fresh and good!  CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!!!, 1
The ER staff here was awesome.  My best friend fell in our hotel room and opened her head up pretty badly.  They were fast and efficient and did a wonderful job of treating her.  Dr. Wayne Sears stitches wounds like an artist!, 1
My niece selected Buca for her birthday meal, 1
I went back again this time to try a variety of cupcakes! We tried the red velvet, 1
Large menu. Lots of  vegan options. Their hummus is a must try. Wasn't a fan of a salad I had but management replaced it with something that would make me happy. We keep coming back here for the good service and healthy choices., 1
Good casual food, 1
This a great little cigar shop with a great variety.  The owner was SUPER helpful and informative.  Prices are at or just below market pricing.   One odd thing...they do not let you touch any of the cigars. They consider it a "hygiene" issue., 1
4.5 stars.  Right when we pulled up and parked you could smell the smoke.  We parked right in front of where they load the wood into their smokers.  It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, 1
Love the pastries, 1
Spinach wrap and iced  tea, 1
The food here is excellent, 1
Hunter S. Thompson once wrote that Circus Circus is what the whole he world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war.   I disagree with that wise man on this issue as I not only think, 1
We dined here on Monday, 1
Amazing place tucked away behind party city. Amazing food, 1
Coming here with a few friends after a long week is more than relaxing. I'm not originally from AZ so Friday night crowd here is more like a nice lounge with great food. The drinks are great. The crowd is always laid back just having a good time. The staff is always very helpful. I occasionally have take out here as well and after a while the staff remembers you and have your food ready when you arrive.   Friendly faces, 1
If you're staying at Venetian, 1
ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO PURE NIGHTCLUB  I came here 2 years ago in November 2011. This is right across from Old Homestead Steakhouse. I describe this place as quaint. That's a perfect description to this nightclub/ bar. Personally I like the decor here than at Pure. There's an intimate vibe that you feel here than at Pure. The dance floor is extremely small. The crowd tends to be older while the younger crowd (21-25 years of age) goes to Pure. Occasionally you'll see some younger crowd here to buy drinks. That's what is cool you get a mixture of old and young without the weird vibe of seeing older people at Pure. The music played is Top 40. The best part of The Gossy Room is from what I observed that you don't pay an entrance fee for the dance floor. The only thing you pay for are the drinks at bar. So if you go to Pure you can come here for a while and then go back to Pure. After dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse you can come here for drinks and to dance. If you decide that you don't want to go to Pure because of the big crowd you can have a great nightclub time here. Surprisingly The Gossy Room is a hidden gem and because of it the one quality that The Gossy Room has is character. I thought what kind of character that brings a mixture of younger and older crowd to this place. There is a Mad Men appeal at The Gossy Room., 1
The good: EVERYTHING. Everything was delicious, 1
I stayed here with my gf and a group of friends about two weeks ago, 1
The best buffet in town. Very high quality food.  But - it is pricey. Dinner was like $45. And no alcoholic beverages with it either. Go to the lunch if possible, 1
The auto repair is open 7 days a week, 1
Every time I come in Donny and his sons are always so attentive.  Pizza by the slice, 1
Between the hours of 7-8am, 1
In a town that's filled with cigarette smoke, 1
Macedonia was good but a little sweet for my taste. But will totally get it again! The chamango was alright not the best. The place has a lot of selection, 1
Went there for mini date. Had the sea bass I believe. Boyfriend had the steak Thai noodle. The best dish ever! Even better than mines and it wasn't bad for $15 bucks. But there menu doesn't have much, 1
Went here tonight with the hubs after repeatedly hearing about it from friends. I got the brisket (no bun), 1
This the coolest, 1
Gas prices were good, 1
I've been to Chima a few times and I LOVE it! I eat like a complete pig and enjoy every minute of it. I love the mashed potatoes that are on the table. The salad bar is not your average salad. My trip I was completely lost but I just decided to try new things. Some I liked, 1
My family and i think this is a wonderful restaurant.  The people there are always so friendly, 1
For the quality, 1
I have wanted to try Pizzeria Bianco, 1
A little messy but an awesome spot with one of the best nail artists in town (Tony). Holly is kind and professional and completely thorough.  Mary has been great with my kids.  I will return (again)!, 1
I have eaten here multiple time and tried various dishes.  I thought that their pizza was just ok, 1
Ubaldo Mora is a magician. We went non-traditional with a chocolate mocha cake. It could not have been more moist and more beautiful. He knew exactly what our vision was for our cake, 1
I am writing this with both respect and frustration for this restaurant. Having spent time in the UK, 1
I am a regular at the Java Den. You might be fooled by the fact that it's in an apartment building lobby. However, 1
I had a wonderful first experience here!! I have two Australian cattle dogs and this was there first time to the groomer, 1
Top Five for Phoenix! Serious food with a restaurant team that doesn't take themselves too seriously. Fish dishes are always fresh and full of flavor. Soups always are amazing. And deserts always surprise. You can't go wrong with anything at Noca., 1
I took a buddy of mine and his son who is leaving for basic training in 2 weeks here to have some fun and thats what we got, 1
I finally checked this place out on a Saturday night. They were under staffed so service was slow but the food was great. We had crab cakes as an app (tasty) Jerk leg of pork and Pan Seared Sea Bass w/ Plantains, 1
I'm a regular at chopshop on Scottsdale road and finally got in to the Tempe location.   Awesome atmosphere and great service. Not to mention the food and drink are always on par and a healthy alternative to pretty much anything else in the area.  Huge fan of there classic club sandwich and hear amazing things about their protein plates.   Perks: giant chess board, 1
Whenever friends or family are in town I always take them here for brunch because of the wide variety of great eats. They have a nice outdoor patio to enjoy your meal at too. Extra points for good music!, 1
Looking for authentic latin food? Get yourself to Sabor Queretano. The location is odd; close to East Towne's Red Lobster in what looks like a neglected strip mall. (Check out the hispanic store next store, 1
One of the perks at staying at the Palms is getting comp'd for many of our food. So we decide to try their buffet which was Bistro. The prime rib was cooked a medium well so it wasn't too bad but not great. It wasn't too tough to chew and it did have tons of flavor.. maybe because I put tons of aui ju and salt. =) Their sushi selection wasn't great but the ones they had were tasty. I felt they could have put more sushi in stead of having the roll be 85% rice. The snow crab legs were great...very sweet and easy to open. Their desert area was pretty good. Their eclairs were good especially with the ice cream. Our server was fast and refilled our drinks constantly., 1
The food was really good and so was our waitress! We had the orange chicken and chow mien!, 1
Ritas never fails to deliver a great Mexican meal at good prices.  Tried the chicken chimy really good as is all the other items I have had. Aaron is gr a at server bar tr nder, 1
This is by far the best place in my area for great food at a fair price. And I can't say enough about the staff ... From Debbie the mgr. Greg, 1
You would not expect a stellar burger at a Vegas hotel restaurant, 1
We really enjoyed ourselves here last night. From the moment we stepped inside the service was impeccable - you can tell these guys are really serious. The menu is huge with dozens of dishes I have never encountered. Being our first visit we kept things simple with coconut chicken curry. Their hot sauce is wonderful, 1
Boondocks is a Modern Sports Bar that has a really Big Patio with High Top Tables, 1
I frequent Mandalay Bay often for concerts taking place at House of Blues, 1
So some facts to throw at you: there are two version of the ride, 1
All I can say is yum.  The surf and turf was the special which was offered.  The dish included filet mignon which was tender and the lobster which was also pretty good.  Not much else to the dish, 1
In San Francisco, 1
I love this place.. Its straight up Cave Creek from where I live.. Its got a great outdoor area to sit at.. Yummy chips... awesome salsa.. great margs.. perfect.. THE only thing I dont like is the refried beans.. they have a plain taste.. but Im not a bean girl anyway.., 1
Their pizza and wings not to mention the pitchers of beer with ice cold frosty mugs are oooooo so good. First off the pizza is definatley a mom n pop pizza. I am not a fan of pizza hut, 1
Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again., 1
amazing!!!!, 1
Had the boneless wings this time around. Mild and honey BBQ split (amzing) - truly tasty. Loved it and of course still the best NYC style pizza in the valley.  Fold over gewey-cheezy, 1
During my stay in Madison, 1
my girls and i would stop by all the time and would always enjoy our evenings here but this time my bf and i decided to stop by for brunch and wasnt that wowed about it...sure they had a variety of food but it wasnt tasty as their regular dishes...the only good thing was that we left paying $25 for brunch and 8 margaritas which were included in the brunch...oh and cant forget about the homemade tortillas made there...stop by and order from their regular menu you cant go wrong with that...btw the service here is awesome they are all very welcoming and always on top of things!, 1
Went last night with my family (party of 7) to celebrate my moms 60th bday..The decor  is nothing special, 1
I had a version of a beef wellington that the owner recommended and it was delicious. I was surprised to see some bad reviews on yelp but we know the owners and always get whatever they recommend. We'll be back, 1
This place was absolutely delicious, 1
Consistent is good when it comes to a neighborhood restaurant. And that is what you can expect when you go to Times Square. You'll see the same servers and kitchen staff and they are always friendly. One of my new favorite pizzas is their vegetarian pizza. It is FULL of artichoke hearts, 1
Hi -  LOVE Soul Caf\u00e9; its owner (Sheila) and her innovative menu..., 1
Eno Vino is an inviting experience. When you first approach you will bypass an outdoor iron chair clad patio type area(in warmer climates) which overlooks nothing but a parking area........ But upon entering, 1
I'd be very happy if every theater in town was like Shea 14. They show the big name movies but also show a nice variety of foreign and independent stuff as well. It's sort of like Camelview 5 but slightly more accessible to the masses.   You can expect a slightly more old school vibe here. That means non-stadium seating and smaller screens than your average theater (although this place still has a few larger screens which they use for the big movies each week).  If you plan on seeing a lesser known movie here, 1
Love the atmosphere. The place has rugby/soccer on the screen while you eat till 9 when it turns into live music.   Had the Irish nachos which was awesome. I highly recommend it with a black velvet.   When I come back to Vegas I will stop here., 1
Took a special person that has not been to Vegas for over 15 years to celebrate his birthday. Wanting to give him a wonderful Vegas dining experience, 1
My folks love this place but I was a bit wary after reading the reviews. I am not a big hibachi fan but they wanted to go for their anniversary. My husband and I thought it was fantastic. The ginger salad; yummeh! The mushroom broth soup; simple and engaging. Even my mushroom detesting husband slurped up the soup, 1
Mellow Mushroom is a great place to go for happy hour drinks. They have reverse happy hour every night. Half off all drinks starting at 10pm! The bartenders and service is great, 1
Great fish tacos.  Small but very tasty.  Cheese quesadilla was good also w queso fresco.  The green sauce was smoky n spicy but not overbearing.   Def will be bk 4 more ;), 1
I called them based on other Yelp reviews. Talked to Alan to set the appointment to fix my microwave oven. He was friendly and gave me several appointment options. Brad was the tech that came out. He showed up at the early part of the time window and called to let me know he was on his way. Brad diagnosed the problem quickly and clearly knew what he was doing. The price was reasonable and he even gave me a $10 credit for an online coupon that I did not know about after I told him I found them on Yelp. I am always nervous about new service people but these guys were professional, 1
Last night had gyro (donner) platter, 1
I used to frequent the original C&A when I lived here in 2002. I just moved back to town and to my delight, 1
Come early! I love all Harkins Theaters, 1
We came here for lunch on a Monday and I really enjoyed my experience here.  I think dinner they let you cook on the grills.  PROs: * $9.95 Lunch specials M-F from 12-2. * The little side dishes (about 5 of them) were very tasty.  One of the best I have had. * Dot sot bimbimpap for $9.95 you can't go wrong. * spicy Chicken combo plate was delish as well. * Waiter was super nice and attentive.  Cons: * A little ways off the strip.  We had to drive there from our hotel.  Which was okay because Mochi Cafe (a few stores down) had free internet access that we needed., 1
It was time for a change --- Love my Stylist but have been craving an old school barber shop cut. From the moment I stepped into Matthew's shop, 1
I had never  done Hot Yoga before. My sister was saying how great it is. I  was like, 1
This place is gorgeous!  I went to Vegas for business and got an amazing suite with a small kitchen, 1
Great start to a night out in Vegas before seeing Lion King at Mandalay. I didn't know they had so many popular restaurants here! I picked Stripsteak because it's Michael Mina and I wanted kobe beef.  The interior is sleek, 1
Want it short and simple? Its like a little piece of chinatown in south vegas. If you are used to dodgy sushi places in chinatown, 1
It's no secret that I really enjoy Chipotle. I love that guacamole is included with the veggie option and their salad dressing is amazing. I could eat it for days without getting sick of it.  Pretty disappointing that on my visit just now they were out of salad dressing... OUT?!  Did I mention they didn't tell me until I paid for my salad that they were out of the amazing salad dressing?? Argh. Double argh. They half-heartedly asked if I'd like to wait 15 mins for dressing, 1
For a fast food type place this was excellent. They had a special- 2 pulled pork samiches for $5.50. The pork was super moist. They had several BBQ sauces to choose after and free ice cream., 1
Shrimp & grits & a shrimp po boy. Believe the hype people!! Would've done 5 stars but service kinda lagged altho it wasn't super busy our waiter left our drinks empty for a awhile..but food is 5 stars for sure !, 1
We stayed at Mandalay Bay this past weekend and overall we had a good experience.  I read through the yelp reviews before my trip and it I was able to prepare for some of the negative things that happened.  The hotel is beautiful.  I am a Vegas frequent and I can find all my needs at Mandalay Bay.  Whether it's fine dining or just casual eateries, 1
I stopped in here briefly on my way home yesterday.  I got my coffee to go, 1
My girlfriend was hungry for dessert after a D'Backs game on Tuesday, 1
The staff is pleasant and helpful. I find some very nice fabric and at great prices, 1
Best buffet of the few my girlfriends and I tried. I went back for more plates than I should probably admit to! Lunch was definitely the only meal I needed that day.The food was wildly rich, 1
Consistently good food, 1
This place was fantastic!!! My fiance and I happened to see this place as we were driving around and it was one of the best impromptu lunch decisions! Our waiter John was so friendly and helpful, 1
Im definitely a fan of this place. I've had one bad experience here, 1
I cracked the screen on my iPhone 5 and decided to wait it out bcos kiosk in malls and wireless toys charged $120+ to get it fix, 1
I was in need of a caffeine boost so last Saturday I decided to pop into Artisan Roast as I happened to be in the area.   So.. what to drink. I was looking at the menu and one of the girls asked me if I needed help. Then I spotted V60 and wanted to know more as I'm still a V60 virgin - or am I? Stay tuned... The girl beckoned me over to show the process of how V60 coffee is made. A filter, 1
I went to Paris Las Vegas for the Grand Opening of the Sugar Factory Chocolate Brasserie. I came in through the hotel lobby. To make it to the Sugar Factory American Brasserie, 1
Had brunch on Saturday, 1
I will be going here again. Their hummus was fresh and tasted great. My gyro was delicious and was made with thicker cuts of lamb. Service was quick and I really enjoyed the place., 1
Good value.  Owners are always working and are good people.  They had a fire recently which closed the place down.  Not sure they've re-opened yet, 1
Staff is friendly but the owners are rude., 1
My fiance and I stumbled across this place, 1
Great prices for great food! It's the best BBQ I've had since moving to Arizona from Missouri. $9 for the sampler plate that filled me up and then some! The two of us ate for $20 plus tip and were thoroughly impressed with the taste and quality of the meats. Sauce was excellent as well. The sides were good too - the spicy fries are addictive., 1
Best golds in the area by far!, 1
Love this restaurant, 1
My friend took me here for lunch.  I had read about the salsa bar and so was looking forward to trying as many salsas as possible.  The server let us try 3 of the taco fillings before we chose.  We then had the chicken, 1
I love this place. Mirage is very nice and fun atmosphere. The rooms are very nice and those beds are amazing. Great places to eat and who can forget about the famous Rhumbar. Sick place to chill, 1
One of the best places to eat in town.  Comfort food in its best form: not expensive, 1
Since the birth of our first child, 1
Great ambiance. Went here before the Beatles Love show. We saw that they had a prix fixe menu when we made the reservations on-line. We had to ask for the special menu when we got there.   I had the shrimp and scallop lettuce cup as an appetizer. Very yummy.   For the main course, 1
I am extremely happy they have a place like this in Las Vegas. I was scared when I moved here I wasn't going to be able to satisfy my super nacho fix. Roberto's is the place to go for late night Mexican food. Plus, 1
Very nice (and pricey) hotel in the perfect location if you want to explore Old Montreal and the tiny Chinatown.  Right across the street from the underground and also a couple of blocks from a nice indoor mall.  Nice rooms (Westin has the best beds around) - some with views of the city...  This is a good hotel for walkers and explorers., 1
Great place to come for gift wrapping, 1
We saw all the mixed reviews and were a little hesitant, 1
Walking through the Forum shops, 1
We live in the neighborhood about 3 years now. There are some absolutely great mom and pop places near the corner of 19th Ave and Northern. But alas there was no bar, 1
This place makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.  It reminds me of the type of hidden gems you find when you go to the mountains...like Blowing Rock, 1
I will never eat another Krispy Kreme again! Ronald's, 1
This place was worth my $25!!!  The dinner was simply amazing! They literally have everything you could think of plus more. The steak and prime rib was perfect medium and juicy. You could still taste the chunks of potatoes in the mashes potatoes. You could make your own taco/nachos in anyway you desire! The best part was probably the seafood! Countless amount of crab legs and shrimp dipped in juicy butter and pepper! AMAZING!   Our server was on point with taking our plates and refilling our drinks. He also gave us our own bottle of hand sanitizer. The only slow part of this place is that if you're not a guest at the RIO, 1
This franchised location of a Triangle staple is quickly becoming one of our go-to options in the South Charlotte / East Ballantyne / Providence neck of the woods. In fact, 1
The food was delicious and the service fantastic! I've been to the Centennial Hills location and it is very good, 1
i take away one star just becuz its sooooo hard to get into this freakn club! it doesnt matter if you're in the front of the line or not, 1
I'm from Detroit and I love that this place is on Freemont street. The coney's are so good, 1
One of the most genius concepts of our time. $15 a month for 2 movies at a time, 1
One of my fave restaurants in Vegas!  Not that expensive (and not cheap of course).  Oysters are good here.  Also had the Beef Carpaccio, 1
We like to order from here for take out.  We usually get Moo Goo Gai Pan, 1
This is a five star facility without question, 1
I am honestly quite baffled by a few reviews on here!  I have been going to Switch for a while now and I go regularly.  I love their unique soups and the fact that they now carry gluten free buns for your enjoyment (and I am sick of eating "lettuce wraps" at other places because I have to eat gluten free)  There is an additional charge for the gf bun but it is very, 1
Great small coffee shop in the heart of Madison.  I typically try to find local coffee shops along my travels that make a manual, 1
This really is a special spot. The barista (possibly the owner's daughter?) was sweet and forthcoming with not just her coffee knowledge but also suggestions on what we should see/eat as out-of-towners and the other barista (who we saw on our second ... third?) visit was an expert at shot-pulling and friendly to boot. It's such a nice feeling to feel welcomed in a strange town.   Plus, 1
Four Peaks is the perfect microbrewery! I've never had a beer from this place that I didn't like, 1
Clean and cute.   Oh yeah and good food.  Service is pretty good, 1
Been here a handful of times.   Service can be a hit or miss. Some days they are constantly looking out to refill your glass with your favorite drink (Four Peaks- Kilt Lifter on tap)  and other days they forget you exist.    Place is very chill/relaxed, 1
One of the best sushi places in Vegas. Fresh and clear sushi restaurant. Waitress was very nice!   My go to place to all you can eat!, 1
This place is always great!! I will always make the trip to the strip (open 24 hours a day) for these sandwiches!  You can not beat the price or the service, 1
Thank you yelpers.  I was looking for great Mexican food and you guys and gals were great.  We came here Friday after a game and I was impressed.  To begin it is not a sit down restaraunt.  You place your order at the counter then find a table.  I ordered the carne asada tacos and they were awesome.  They had onions and cilantro.  The slasa was great.  These little tacos were a great way to end the day.  Now if they sold tequila it would be perfect.  But I do recomend it for those who want delicious tacos., 1
The hubby and I finally made it out to Z Pizza over the weekend.   I ordered the Moroccan and my husband had the Greek pizza. Both pizzas were very tasty. The carmelized onions and pine nuts on the Moroccan were simply yummy!  I think the prices are a little high, 1
Pho-king phenomenal!  I have to say it... This place hosts the best pho I've ever eaten. I got the Pho Dac Biet and tasted the Pho Ga. Both were amazing (my favorite being the Dac Biet). The chef was not shy about how much of "the fixins" to add! The broth was stewed to near perfection and every bite spread happiness throughout my tum tum. I also got to try the spring rolls. They were spot on and were super fresh! I could not have asked for a better Saturday lunch that day, 1
This is one busy gas station as it's the only one around to service a very large community so the pumps are usually crowded. However, 1
I highly recommend Mark 5 Painting! They work fast! Great reasonable prices and there work was amazing! We had a color in mind for the house and Mark gave us his professional input on doing two tone accents on certain areas of the house, 1
Teaaaaa-licious! I will resist my urge to make victory puns and instead make ones about tea. I give this place a chai five for its tealightful loose leaf selection and cute little serving trays. I pity the fool who hasn't tried this place - Mr. Tea.  They offer a handful of food items (mainly sandwiches) but have a nice little vegan panini. It's not much (grilled flatbreads with vegan cream cheese, 1
dr evenson was a good dr but just not my cup of tea I need personality...dr.coy was amazing he told me im crazy and now im at peace..lol jk but really I like this practice and the girls in the front aren't as rude as everyone makes them out to be im happy to be a patient!, 1
Great mid-Strip hotel so convenient to walk to most things up and down the Strip. Large comfortable rooms -- this is an all-suites hotel so every room has a small kitchen, 1
Jared Davis, 1
I'm sorry that Maggie was treated rudely at Restaurant Depot, 1
I've heard a lot of people rave about Serendipity 3 but mostly from the New York location. Finally i got to try it!  The food was okay not incredibly delicious, 1
Do I have to elaborate when I say, 1
This is my favorite place to eat of all restaurants I have ever tried. The atmosphere is fun. Go with a date and it's romantic. Go with friends and it's fun. Host a group of people and it's even more fun! Can be snuggled in a booth or take over the center of the place with your group. Can sit up at the small bar too. The waiters have always been what seem to be handsome Italian men and the most fun servers. This place reminds me of a venue that would be in a mob movie. Has live talented music.  The food is some of the best I have tasted. The Garlic Loaf is to die for! Alfredo is my favorite. And the limo ride to and from the restaurant is complimentary with a tip to the driver. FOOD ALLERGY- I was planning a small party here and they offered to get special ingredients so all who had food allergies could enjoy the food., 1
Almost indistinguishable from Springhill Suites (located next door) and to a lesser degree Residence Inn, 1
I eat here almost every day and its always delicious!  My favorites are the caprese, 1
Great car buying experience!  From the time we walked in the door our sales guy was nice, 1
this place is fantastic! i feel pretty guilty for not finding my dress here because everyone was so wonderful and accommodation. the experience was fabulous for both myself and my family and friends that came along.  this boutique is gorgeous and offers a wide variety of unique dresses. it is owned by a mother and daughters team and you can really see that they care about you and getting you in the right dress. they start with a mini consultation to get an idea about what you are looking for as well as the look and feel of your wedding. they also give you the opportunity to look at all the dresses and tag the ones that you want to try on. your family and friends can get settled in a very cute viewing parlor area and get ready for the show while they also prep their changing rooms for you.  uptown is awesome in the fact that they give you a slip. this helps for the modest girls that dont like to go around prancing around in their panties all day in front of strangers. they are also awesome because they help you in and out of every dress and make you feel beautiful during the process. they also are great at recommending dresses you thought would never look good on you but actually look terrific!  if you want a unique wedding dress in the valley, 1
I absolutely LOVE Bergies!  Everything from the atmosphere, 1
My favorite one in Charlotte b/c it is not in a strip mall.  Parking can be tricky but you can always find it on the street., 1
This place is fun! Who couldn't like a bar on the main drag in Madison that has a huge tree in the middle of it?  Beer list is ok, 1
Continuing my Gordon Ramsey experience, 1
Those who have cats and love them as much as I do, 1
Out of all the Peruvian spots in Charlotte this has to be my favorite.  Incredible seasoning.  Huge portions at a not so huge cost.  Only thing I didnt like, 1
If you are a crazy U of I fan then you have to have the clothes to go with the attitude, 1
King crab legs for the win! Almost every buffet on the strip offers some sort of crab legs but with different options on opening them. These are cut open taking all of the hard work out of it for you! Many other options from around the world including Italian, 1
The food is usually well worth it for AYCE BBQ. If you come between 10pm-2am everything is $13.99 their usual price is $16.99. We also get short ribs and steam egg and with those items no matter what time you come it's $16.99   If you never had Korean BBQ before this is a great place to start. I recommend the salad, 1
Had the barbie and the captains order...freakin amazing...literally too yummy for words. Ric hooked us up too, 1
Kind of seems like your basic coffee house, 1
My wife and I are big fans of the french fries. The burgers are great, 1
I love the decor....clean, 1
Open Christmas eve!  They serve Patron Anejo !  And...  They have low carb cheesecake!, 1
Kosama is hands down the best gym I have ever been a member of. The classes are varied and designed for all experience and fitness levels. Each week of working out gives you a balanced fitness of strength, 1
Nice and cozy and old looking setting. Great place for a friendly gathering or taking a foody date. really like the small outside setting, 1
I came to Goodman's the first time around with a friend to pick up a birthday present for her mom. I think we must have gone through all of the diamond jewelry available in the store...but the lady helping us out was just as friendly and patient with us at the end as she was in the beginning. Really, 1
This place is better than Blanco. The Beast is a must-try as well. Be sure to have it enchilada style!, 1
Chandelier is spot on in terms of creating a glitzy, 1
Came back this past weekend and got a couch for my little bro's 21st birthday. Had to update this review and say that we could not ask for better service! Our promoter, 1
Personally I love this place. Its small, 1
I heard about this restaurant through mutual friends and coworkers, 1
The Coffee Cup is a great, 1
I am giving Tao 4 stars based on my other experiences in Las Vegas, 1
This is a cute little bakery that I've probably driven by hundreds of times since I work right down the street, 1
Wife and I looking for sushi after 10 months of pregnancy and banned from anything raw we reluctantly ventured out with our five day old and found sushi j just around the corner from where we live.  I work in San Francisco and have traveled quite a bit dining at some of the best sushi restaurants in the country so know quality fish when I see and taste it. I highly recommend sushi j!!!  We had the sashimi combo which featured yellowtail, 1
Went to see Joey Yung 1314 concert at the Grand Garden Arena in MGM Las Vegas. The stadium was foggy, 1
WARNING! My rating is based off the wings and beer. Nothing else on the menu.    I was a big hooters fan, 1
Lynn and I ate lunch today at Island Malaysian Cuisine in Las Vegas. I had the Satay Tofu and Fried Shrimp with Black Pepper (spicy). Lynn had roti canai for a starter and a vegetable plate. She also had mangos with sticky rice for dessert. I drank mango juice. Malay food, 1
Recently I became consumed with the over whelming desire to consume crepes. After searching Yelp, 1
J'avais entendu une tonne de bons commentaires sur L'Gros Luxe, 1
It's like Marnee Thai in San Francisco or Fantastic Cafe in Long Beach or Mastro's Ocean Club in Laguna Beach or Le Diplomat in Irvine.  When I think of Las Vegas, 1
my husband and i ended up with free tickets to the show and upgraded ourselves to reserved seating for $11 dollars a piece. we had a very fun time we laughed the whole time. i wouldnt recommend this to people with younger children because there is a lot of adult humor. but as two adults we really enjoyed the show!, 1
Excellent tacos and salsa bar. Great price at $2 each. Will definitely be back., 1
Pricey?  Yes.  Worth it?  COMPLETELY!  When you walk into the room for the first time, 1
Being a transplant Pittsburgher (and partially Polish) that now lives in Florida, 1
I've been here twice. The first time was for an inspection, 1
First time visiting this restaurant.   Had the chicken parm and it was very good! Food quality and quantity were above average.   The only complaint I have was the espresso was cold. Other than that it was tasty., 1
This restaurant is not closed... It is just under a different name. the menu is still the same as also the staff. Same Great Awesome food just under a different name., 1
This place rocks. The real deal.  Late night menu is a real treat.  Superb mixologists at the bar.  Mind blowing cocktails.  High quality food that's fresh and scrumptious.  I love going here prior to partying in Old Town Scottsdale.  Very sexy establishment., 1
If I ever need a place to have a great coffee and work somewhere other than the hotel (I visit Phoenix often) or the office, 1
My dog is pretty difficult to work with and tends to nip here and there. Vincent was his regular groomer at Groomingdales and we really liked him. He always did an awsome job and the best thing is, 1
the staff is super friendly. I drop off laundry for my business and they do a great job. And yes, 1
One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! I've been here several times, 1
I got the Full Montagu sandwich and first bite of it sorta transported me back to my childhood  visit to Montreal Quebec Canada where they  have the most delicious roast beef and corned beef sandwiches similar in taste to this Earl sandwich. My meal could of been perfect if I opted to not get the frozen lemonade. That was such a sugar bomb where I had to down so much water to wash the sweetness out of my mouth. Still 4 stars for something that can transport you to a time back in the past! :)   The line to get the sandwich is pretty long but moves pretty fast but friend and I were stuck in line still for a good 15 minutes before we got to the cashier., 1
We had the platter for two but in reality its a platter for 4. The best BBQ I've had in the States, 1
I work in the close area and visit many of the bars around Mill Ave, 1
Brought a friend in on literally the last day I had to use my groupon - show was great and there was no pressure from the wait staff with regards to ordering a bunch of drinks/food. A good beer was a decent $5 (minimum two per person) and the comedy was laid out in style., 1
This place is amazing. Accidentally spent way more than I wanted to.  Fair pricing.  Am going to be a regular customer., 1
What more can I say.  Nice staff coupled with the best New York Style pizza in town, 1
nice atmosphere, 1
Was on my way to a different place for lunch when I stumbled upon this little place. Couldn't been more satisfied, 1
Office is pleasant and organized. Great experience with new doc - Dr. Joshua Millstein. He took the time to listen and explain things., 1
my go to for BBQ. Love the beer selection too, 1
EGGCITING!!!  First time here, 1
The food is great and the menu is simple. Burgers and fries, 1
Been here now many times and the majestic Usher Hall doesn't fail to impress me. The main hall has been a venue for comedy, 1
I've been shopping with the Attic since the early 1990's. Way before their claim to fame Visa commercial hit the airwaves...  New location, 1
This is great ice cream that is made in the store by the owners and their friendly staff. They have a ton of special flavors and they let you try anything you want! They really want you to be happy with what you order.  The price is right in line with what you would expect. Cheaper and better than Cold Stone, 1
Had dinner at the bar area. The food was delicious and the creme brulee was amazing! The service was top notch! Plan on coming back for happy hour sometime!, 1
Visited this place a few months ago and both the service and food was incredible. Going there again this week sometime. Can't wait., 1
The Fiesta Bowl was the bomb ! I turned it into a salad :) it was so fresh with generous amounts of fresh avacado, 1
Took my 4-year-old for a treat. Disappointed that we couldn't eat our treats there (just one tiny table). The selection was just okay: red Velvet, 1
Great pizza with good prices. Definitely would come back., 1
Not to bad, 1
My fellow Leithers rave about Word of Mouth, 1
Athena is AH-MAZ-ING!!! I'm so thankful for Yelp members helping me find her. I've had a hard time finding anyone to trust with my hair (all it takes us one mess up at Super Cuts!) since moving back from Napa. (where I was spoiled with salons!)   Athena listens to what you want. She is busy, 1
Better going there in the last 1-2 hours of closing so you are not waiting all day.  They do have a snack bar and plenty of seating., 1
Fun and affordable with great atmosphere.  Hidden off the main strip of Penn Ave next door to Enrico's famous Biscotti Co bakery is this tiny, 1
Very cool addition to Scottsdale.  We enjoyed some drinks at the bar this past weekend and really liked this place.  The bartenders were great - friendly and very helpful., 1
Returned to Vegas and Hotel 32 again, 1
Love it! Love it! Love it! It's always so yummy!, 1
I walked in here for lunch today and I was like "whoa". And my co-worker was all "wha?" And then some random lady was all "foo-ie" and we were like "say what?" And then this old school dude was all "yo, 1
Compared to other airports I like CLT!  They have gotten a little slow on getting gate checked bags to us.  Each bathroom has an attendant and is always clean., 1
We ordered the stuffed pizza. While similar to a Chicao-style pizza, 1
I've been going here for years! Such a cute little store where you can pick and choose exactly what you want on your cupcake. I usually get the strawberry cake with white chocolate frosting. Yum yum yum!, 1
Wow! What a great restaurant! I meant to write this review sooner so it would be more detailed, 1
Just got home from the Bistro.  We got the calamari, 1
Verde lives up to the buzz!    I've been there twice now in the past two weeks - once for a private pre-opening event and again last night for a work-dinner function.  While both visits were  during Verde's 'soft launch, 1
Wow. I first ate at Ted's about 7 years ago and absolutely hated it, 1
The best burger I've ever had. I went to In and Out in AZ and in Vegas, 1
When I go to Mamma Mia it's for the $3.50 two slices and a small drink. Can't beat the price, 1
My husband and I found this place by accident and how lucky was that! The service was outstanding from the second we walked in the door. The bar was comfortable without a doubt. The drinks were amazing!! We were rocking there Old Fashion Moonshine cocktail which was fabulous, 1
Been here multiple times and always get friendly, 1
AMAZING!!! The peppered-steak is my most favorite! I've had their cheesy broccoli and caulflower side as well, 1
The wings are AWESOME here! Huge sized & definitely worth the price! Me & my family always get the XL pizza & 24 wings special that's $24.99, 1
I tried MTO Caf\u00e9 on my last trip to Vegas and I was really surprised such a great restaurant opened up downtown. The food is amazing. I had the 1/2 Iceberg wedge salad and Mac N Cheese, 1
Amazing pizza. The crust and sauce are delicious. Loved the fresh mozzarella. Service was great. The manager even offered to serve our pizza. I heated up a slice the next day on the stove and it was still great., 1
Spices, 1
A lovely little bakery and shop in the fabulous stockbridge. We stopped here for a quick pastry ( as you can see from my photo, 1
We celebrated my brother in laws 26th b-day and the food was delicious. Everything came out perfect. We werent big fans of the spaghetti, 1
Having read the past reviews, 1
Went here on a recent trip to Montreal. It's in the old city so prices are a little inflated. We stayed away from the avocado fries thanks to some reviews we read. The owner was a bit pushy/weird in a way that people who have been to Mediterranean countries might relate to and wanted us to sit outside when it was freezing, 1
from what I remember (and was told!!) we had a blast here!  drank and danced after a suns game for about 3 hours.  Music was great for dancing....not sure about the comments here about no alcohol on the bottom floor, 1
Great food on a fantastic menu. Lola's is an off-strip/downtown gem for authentic New Orleans cuisine. The bronzed catfish is superb with the grits, 1
Dentists are mean, 1
Trendy and yummy, 1
First time at Fired Pie today. Met my daughter for lunch. We arrived at 2:00 PM on a Monday and there were about 8 other tables. Good sign to be this busy after the lunch rush.   I ordered a pie with tomato sauce and pesto, 1
What can I say that hasn't already been said, 1
This is an extremely good Indian restaurant. The chefs certainly know their way around a spice rack. My favorite dish so far is the vegetable korma. I'd suggest ordering a side of garlic naan with your meal, 1
Went for my sis in-law's bachy, 1
My go to place to binge study and eat breakfast sandwiches at all hours of the night! Miss ya Amelie's! Now that I don't live near Charlotte I realize how much I took this little gem for granted., 1
This is a review for the club only.  I definitely give Lavo bonus points, 1
one of Pittsburgh's gem in art. the fact that they support artists by giving them a place to stay as they create one of a kinda site specific installations for the mattress factory is awesome. the art changes and is always a pleasant surprise if you like looking at new stuff.   take your time and go through each level and you'll have an art filled adventure., 1
My family has been coming here for over 50 years for special birthdays, 1
My husband and I visited for something "different" for our first anniversary. The owner was lovely and granted my possibly odd request to fondue our now defrosted wedding cake for dessert.  Everything we tasted was spectacular from the unique bruchettas (loved the fig, 1
My gf & I found this place by accident. & what a gem we found. The pizza is ginormous! Think of 2 1/2 slices of Costco pizza for 1 slice of pin up pizza. The pizza had so much flavor & perfect amount of cheese. You get it piping hot out of the oven! My gf got the cheese & I got the ultimate meat one. The cheese was all gooey & perfect. My pizza, 1
I have been to Vegas twice and the first night of both visits was spent at Harrah's Carnival Court.  Recommended by others that had been there before us, 1
If you're at all a "Foodie" you can't come to Phoenix, 1
In a strip mall, 1
This place is great! Although, 1
Service was excellent and food was great.  My steak was so perfectly seasoned and cooked, 1
The manager/owner is normally on site to welcome you, 1
This place should have a sign out front that says incredible lunch $13. Was here while on holiday in Montreal, 1
Nice variety on menu for lunch and dinner.  The chicken salad/wrap is delicious along with burgers, 1
I love this place for their happy hour specials and (most) of the staff is pretty awesome and know how to make great drinks, 1
Great little place. The guy at the counter was very helpful explaining this new sandwich concept and pointing out popular items.   They take two slices of bread sort of a french bread, 1
So I went to Switch and walked into the back door, 1
Well it is the best. For me that is. It just came to me that I have never seen a male working here, 1
This reveiw is just for the one item on the menu that I always order. If you're having that late night munchies after clubbing...try THE REUBEN.  Its a corned beef sandwich with saurkraut (sp?) and swiss cheese. But what tops this sandwich off is a sunny side up egg. It was an intoxicated discovery...hahah. Oh and also...we discovered to order the eggs over medium or over hard to prevent  excessive dripping.   This place used to be known for their 5.99 steak and eggs special (which they got rid of wahhh).  Overall food is decent and priced ok., 1
Interesting that this show opened on May 12 and no one had added it to Yelp before now. Oh I know why. Because it's at the Riviera - a casino that always seems like a ghost town.  My friend had free tickets through one of the many seat filler type sites that keep popping up left and right. So with the caveat that I saw it for free, 1
I talked to this guy and told him I live down the street and I needed somewhere to go for the night. Since it wasnt a trip they gave me a better deal. When you book here there are many different rooms. The one I got was a 1 bedroom and it had a private outdoor jacuzzi! It was like your own porch and your own backyard. It came with a free breakfast at thier restaurant wich was very good too. I only paid like 120 for the night.   Super private, 1
Think of all the chinese and sushi dishes you like and chances are you will find it here. The Jasmine Tokyo buffet is a one stop shop for tackling your craving for noodles, 1
Perfection. Need I say more? I'm going to anyways. No matter what people say, 1
"Spot On" reviews fellow Yelpers!!  Thank you!  I was not disappointed!  TCA is a hidden gem!  As everyone has said, 1
AMAZING creamy tomato bisque. I am always craving this soup now. The chicken salad sandwich on a crescent roll was a tad disappointing and bland, 1
This is one of the better places to dine in Casa Grande. The temperature of the restaurant and the speed of the service knock a star right off. It is freezing in the restaurant, 1
Go for the views, 1
The Cabaret is one of my fav theater venues in the 'burgh!  I love the intimate vibe of the theater, 1
I was in Scottsdale for work, 1
Bomba! Wow.. I'm here eating while I draft this review. Don't sleep on this place!!!, 1
I liked this motel. The people were soooooo nice!  It had all the amenities we could need for a stay.  It happened there was no coffee pot, 1
All I can say is YUMMY!!  Best Mexican food in town!, 1
If all you want to read is this first sentence, 1
Omg I can't say enough about how good the food is. The black cod melts in your mouth!! I can't wait to go back In August, 1
Food is reliably very good.  The owners run the place and recognize regulars.  Lots of vegetarian options, 1
Really enjoyed it! My friends and I went last week Wednesday and wanted to do it again so we did. It was a good experience! Everybody from beginners to experts was so down to earth and were all willing to chip in their own information on what works for them.   Also, 1
Great spot for donuts and coffee, 1
Restaurant has So much character., 1
Jenni, 1
Great place to store my stuff I truly recommend this location friendly service too. Will tell all my family and friends about coming here if they need storage. Thanks Public Storage!, 1
Went here for lunch today and it was good! The sour dough bread they give you prior to your meal is phenomenal!  I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara and it was delish! Enough to share, 1
I attended Paint Nite today at a local restaurant through the use of a Living Social voucher. The instructor Linda was great she was funny and made the class entertaining and light hearted. I had a good time. The venue itself was Florida Cafe which was clean but not the best part of town I wouldn't want to be there for a night class. And the server for the restaurant was really slow with the drinks.  I think these girls could do amazing if they set up a location of their own.  But given the whole experience of just the painting removing the Florida Cafe from it I had fun and would attend again at a different location., 1
Get a rewards card before you order and you can save $1 on each dish you order! I had seafood noodle soup and shrimp spring rolls. The dip was so yummy. I couldn't get enough of it. The noodle soup was delicious as well. Great dining experience., 1
I'd totally be lying if I told you I didn't enjoy this. This show was AWESOME!! Maybe it's because I've been reading 50 Shades of Grey, 1
I was very hesitant to try BLT after a lot of these reviews but I'm glad we did.  We were very happy with our cocktails, 1
My second visit to Del Frisco's, 1
I wish we had six stars!!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dentist!  Dr. Fowler and his staff are absolutely wonderful.  Dr. Fowler, 1
OMG..every time I come to Vegas I have to eat this. Plus, 1
Your average GOOD Mexican Cantina.  They have all the usual suspects you'd expect and give you fresh chips and salsa when you sit down.  Everything seemed very fresh and had great flavor.  I'd compare this place with your local high quality Mexican restaurant.  While it was perfectly great, 1
Vanilla pastry study was a great place to pick up some desert one the way out from D's. Hot dogs and cupcakes?  Yes, 1
Food was great! Place was clean! And service was fast and the owner was incredibly gracious and friendly!, 1
If you're hipster and love some good coffee, 1
The teachers are what make Bliss stand out, 1
My in-laws are owners and they've let us use their timeshare several times and we love it (for the most part)...  The Good: The rooms are AWESOME - think small condo. Every time I stay there my thought is always "I could live in here"...It has everything you could possibly need. It has a fully stocked kitchenette, 1
I liked it a lot.  It's inside the "W" Hotel which is a bit fanatically over-cool, 1
Update!  If you happen to go and enjoy your experience at Wag N Wash, 1
Best place to get authentic mexican tacos/food at 4am after the club lol(:  open 24hr., 1
I had an emergency at a home based business and found Deke's on Yelp and chose them based of their great reviews. They went above and beyond expectations. They fit me in same day since it was an emergency, 1
Workers were on-time, 1
It is one of those places you just feel plain silly reviewing.   Everything was perfect. When you pay for perfection - you get it!   Best pool experience I've ever had (the asian chicken salad is great too)! Parasol bar is the perfect place to meet with folks, 1
The best BBQ in all of AZ! Try them, 1
Being a well-seasoned Indian food consumer, 1
Great lunch specials! Quick delivery, 1
I am writing this review hoping it won't violate the TOS.  I was present at the appointment for my father.    He had some concerns about moles and through Yelp I found Dr. Linder.    She was amazing! Kind and caring and her staff was very pleasant.  We didn't have to wait long for the appointment (3 weeks) and we were in the waiting room for about 10 minutes.    She seems to be very busy but as a patient it doesn't seem to affect.   Also, 1
Technical Systems Support was a lifesaver during our rush order request! Mike was instrumental in getting our PTZ cameras and new sound system installed and connected to Wirecast during our product & consumer research office relocation.    Mike is friendly, 1
Pretty good burger.  Service was friendly and attentive and I really love those brioche buns.   I will say, 1
From the salads to the desserts, 1
Always enjoy the experience of dining at Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. Probably the best selection of seafood items in the Greater Phoenix area. We both ordered salmon dishes. My wife's was med-rare and she ordered well. It was quickly taken care of and corrected.   The service was excellent. Our waiter, 1
What a fun place. I really enjoyed the experience. I am not sure I was that crazy about the food but that was through no faulty of the restaurant. I ordered a veg dish and a crepe type of french naming Empanada thing. Sorry forgot the name. It was stuffed with carrots and other veggies. ( that dish, 1
We love this place! The food is fantastic and staff are wonderful. Go get a great Greek wrap asap!, 1
Service was amazing, 1
Pho was the perfect cure for a night of drinking sweet daquiris and eating junk food.   The broth was expertly spiced, 1
If you don't want to fight the crowds at Camelview 5, 1
I judge a restaurant by its burger.   The burger is a perfect measuring stick for every-day dining establishments; It is sold almost everywhere and does not rely on special ingredients and is always a good barometer of a kitchen's capacity for meeting your temperature needs.    That said, 1
These burgers are...Hear me people....TO DIE FOR. Oh my GOD these burgers are soooooooo good! I posted pictures upon my first visit a few months ago feel free to take a look. Upon this visit I was killing myself eating the husband looks at me and says...Baby did you get your pictures for yelp.com? LMAO I had a mouth full of burger so I just shook my head ...NO.  Now yall know its good when you forget to take pictures....LOL  The staff are extra kind the building is extra clean and the food is well how shall I say  OH my its pure pleasure to your toung and gums and yo belly when you eat this burger. The fries are steak fries! OMG I think I may go get one or two at this very moment Ive made myself quite hungry :) These burgers are so good you will STAB somebody!, 1
Yum! So glad I randomly discovered this place. We originally went to L'elys\u00e9e, 1
I came here for afternoon tea yesterday with my cousin and loved it. What a beautiful room  everything so clean and shining, 1
The best thing about Ginbu 401 is they deliver...literally.  I've both eaten in the restaurant and ordered delivery from them.  Both have been consistent sushi.  Nothing to rave about, 1
Visually beautiful performance on a water stage.  Intimate venue and I, 1
The atmosphere is dark, 1
Mmmmmm....  Donuts....  We had dinner next door at Johnny Mac's then when leaving we decided to stop and get a donut to take home for dessert.   One donut X3 turned into a box of donuts after drooling over the display case.   They were making fresh donuts in the back while we were there and the aromas convinced us to get way more donuts then we could actually eat, 1
I thought I was going to love this place.  I did, 1
Best authentic Mexican food in Vegas! And the horchata is delicious! I have been to a lot of Mexican places that don't even compare. You have to try it to believe it!, 1
This is my first 5 Star rating but it is very well deserved.  Went for dinner on "date night" with my wife and was looking for somewhere different.  This location has been here for a while but, 1
happy hour from 12pm-7pm was the best on the south side of the strip! The waitresses are hot, 1
This is a really charming little option just off Fremont.  It's across the street from the El Cortez.  They took a nondescript building and made it into a modest boutique hotel.  The lobby and rooms are modern and downright hip for Downtown Vegas.  If you love gambling downtown, 1
The food here is really good.  I love the fried rice and the other dishes  like chicken and beef are great also.  Don't order egg plant though...It was not too tasty., 1
Excellent food.   Very nice atmosphere without being stuffy.  Steak is the obvious choice and it's a good choice., 1
Amazing breakfast burritos that are loaded with eggs/chorizo, 1
Easily the best hotel for the price (I would have paid more for what you get). I just recently returned from a Friday-Sunday trip and was shocked at my 950 sq ft room. Beautiful rooms, 1
Literally "As good as it gets"!!  Everything was top notch!    Great beer selection; I had a French Kronenbourg, 1
The doctor and his staff at Webster Orthodontics ( http://las-vegas-orthodontist.com/ ) are very friendly and inviting. My oldest daughter has just started with her invisalign "braces" there and loves not having to wear the traditional braces.  At this office, 1
The food and service are some of the best in Vegas- beats the Steve Wynn steakhouse hands down!!!  Mark, 1
Came here on a Friday morning, 1
There is nothing on their menu that I do not like. Me and a friend actually go there once a month and gorge out!!!!   Best poppers I have ever had. Fresh lemonade that only is perfect for a hot summer day. Great service. Met the owner and he is what makes small businesses great.  I tell everyone that I know in Vegas to go and hit up that spot., 1
Seriously good coffee.  I'm not really a coffee drinker, 1
If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, 1
They're GREAT!  Everything tastes just like it does in Chicago...love the tamales!!! Sharon D, 1
After a cold hike around Old Montreal, 1
We recently used ABF to move our belongings from Miami, 1
I had heard the owner had sold... and was really concerned that the food might have slipped.  No slip at all.  The food is still excellent.  I had a terrific sandwich on a Pretzel Roll.... Wow really tasty...but a bit salty for my taste...but overall the sandwich was wonderful.  Good job.  I am so relieved., 1
Came here while in Pittsburgh for work. Got the Pazzo Cheesesteak, 1
I went to Yelp to find a good Chinese food delivery place and came upon this one.  The last one I used to go to must have changed owners or something because the food went from amazing to awful.  I'm so glad we found this one.  The prices are reasonable and the food was delicious.  I ordered the spicy thai chicken and it was awesome. It had lots of chicken and good quality chicken at that.  My boyfriend ordered the hunan spicy beef and again the beef was perfectly cooked.  We also ordered the pot stickers, 1
This hotel was better than what i expected. I stayed here during good friday weekend with a couple of friends (yeah I know we are sinners) and it couldn't have been better. We arrived at the hotel at 6AM despite knowing check-in was at 3PM. We were so tired from our trip so we asked the lady in the front desk how much would it be to check-in early she said the hotel does not charge a fee for early check-in (According to the receptionist the website only says 30 dollar fee just as a window so people wont ask for early check-ins). She was so generous and let us check-in to both rooms we had reserved. Over all i love Monte Carlo because of its location, 1
Everyone loves Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwiches (and they are pretty damn good) but the service here is friendly and the place is just damn spotless clean.  The men's can even has some kind of dried flower arrangement, 1
This store is truly a hidden gem.  After getting beyond brutal service at the Forum shop in Caesar's I found this store. Even though its smaller than the Forum store, 1
Wow!  So glad I decided to give this a try.  This serves as dinner and an evening's entertainment all wrapped into one. And, 1
This is my favorite Compare, 1
Welcome to the Kushi Age.  I have to admit to not knowing what Kushi Age is, 1
The Kir Royale is why I stopped here. Champagne frosting on raspberry cake - nom nom nom.  As I was having an adventure in Henderson today, 1
Don't let the name frighten you away. The food here is very authentic, 1
Filling American breakfasts and very good service.   If you want better than Dennys or most of the strip, 1
If someone hadn't told us exactly where to find Dick's, 1
I really dont like pork. I never cook it, 1
Those pancakes are THE BOMB! Great coffee too. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!, 1
Best Thai food I have ever had!  Based on the recommendation of a cabbie, 1
This is such a great place to grab a drink and a bite to eat whilst downtown. The staff couldn't be more friendly and the food has never disappointed. They have great happy hour specials ... My fave is the fish and chips and the pineapple mule drink is delish!, 1
This is Vegas, 1
Today was the first time I  have eaten here.  The first thing I wonder is why it has two names, 1
Our group decided to go fancy for my bestie and my birthday dinner in Vegas, 1
Main Points: -One of the few southeast valley breweries -Excellent service -Good variety of beer  Review: Being a fan of craft beer, 1
Awesome serivce every time! The food is good too:) I love their Monday Tuesday specials!, 1
I moved to the Rhodes Ranch area a year 1/2 ago, 1
My Rep Tony was very helpful and helped us set up a great system for our new home. The customer service has been very helpful with any questions that we have had. Great company and quality local service. Highly recommended ;), 1
I was in the area for work and my colleague mentioned this place for lunch.  I'm all about BBQ. So needless to say, 1
I don't know what it is about this place but I absolutely love it.  The food is amaze.  I have not tried anything there that I have't liked.  They have the best chips, 1
This restaurant is simply one of the best breakfast restaurants in town. US Egg has great pricing, 1
Fresh meats and veggies! Rice was perfectly cooked, 1
I just came here with my sister looking for a boba place and we came across this place. It was our first time coming here and the owner was there and he was really nice and helpful with us.  He gave us the buy one get one free boba drinks Specials and it was a pretty good deal, 1
Excellent service, 1
I have no idea why there are negative reviews. Maybe they were tired, 1
I delt with Larry everything worked fine they had the wheel they had the great price product arrived on time what more could I ask for thank you Larry., 1
I have been taking my 2 cockapoos, 1
I was here once before with a bag of old things that the man working helped me with. This was my second time coming back. And I got the same high level of customer service and treatment. The store is clean, 1
The crazy thing is that this really works!!! I've been going to Vegas clubs for years and have always had to try to locate promoters on the strip or call to get on guest lists. Or I had to call the couple of promoters I know for only specific clubs.  Typically I had to wait in long lines.  Since my wife and I were going to Vegas for Halloween I decided to prepare ahead of time.  I stumbled across the website on line and after reading others reviews I decided to give it a try. I signed up to go to Tryst (one of the pricier clubs) on the evening of Halloween and got an instant confirmation. Chris was very thorough and began to be in communication leading up to that evening.  I have to admit I was skeptical since it was one of the busiest Vegas club nights of the year.  However, 1
I got the Hawaiian BBQ and it had grilled chicken, 1
Very good new restaurant right off the square.  Our party of 4 tried several dishes and all of us were very happy with the food and generous portion sizes.  They even modified one of the entrees (the Korean "sushi")  for us to share as an appetizer and substituted a kimchi plate instead of the soup (we did not ask for it and were pleasantly surprised).   Would recommend asking for your Bibimbap in a stone bowl - really ads a lot to the dish with the crispy rice bits in the bottom.  looking forward to going back soon, 1
Tr\u00e8s bon fish & chips. Le poisson est tendre \u00e0 souhait, 1
This was my slogan for the Imperial Palace: "It's like Caesar's Palace, 1
This is the best Mexican food restaurant I've eaten at in the Phoenix area. Their salsa and chips are outstanding. I order the ground beef tacos every time I come here. The service is friendly and attentive with no signs of  "attitude" which detracts from many Mexican restaurants around here., 1
The flowers were beautiful - just as displayed on their website - and they were able to fulfill a same day request., 1
Go here about once a week.  They always have super flavors... although I'm stuck on the vanilla with a couple  toppings. :)   Staff is always very friendly and helpful.  Super clean store., 1
I had dinner there only one time and it was really good. The person working was very friendly. They didn't rush me and a friend who sat there for a couple hours socialize over dinner. Price is good - competitive. I agree with Bill Z - egg drop soup was only okay. The Kung Pao Chicken was VERY good. My friend had Sweet & Sour Chicken and said it was good. She chose House of Yang for our dining location, 1
I had a really nice experience eating at Abacus Inn tonight.   The place is small and unassuming in a little strip mall.  If you weren't looking for it, 1
For an AYCE establishment, 1
Tuesday is opposite day.  Or is it Thursday?  I don't know anymore.  I'm bored with reviewing at the moment, 1
Right in busy financial district of Edinburgh about 200 yards from Princess Street. Very nicely done up inside and a great place to chill out after work while everyone else is running around looking for buses etc., 1
On a recent visit I had the duck which was tender enough to cut with a fork and extremely well flavored. The spinach and parmasean soup was out of this world! A fanastic find and very enjoyable atmoshpere. Resonably priced wine and good service make this a "I'll be back" restaurant., 1
Visited Ru San's for the first time on Friday evening.  I called ahead to set up a table for 8 people.  We had fantastic service from Eric.  We ordered the yakitori as an appetizer:  Conch, 1
This is one of the new locations, 1
We decided to try this place after the Las Vegas Weekly ran a rave review. We weren't disappointed.  But there are some low points: First, 1
I had a quick layover and I was starving! I needed something close to my gate that was fast and easy. Modern Burger did just that and more.   The Breakfast Burger caught my eye on their huge wall menu. Fresh ground beef, 1
Per usual, 1
Originally tried because of a Groupon. Heidi has a very light calming touch, 1
This place is amazing! They should call it chateua of the valley! double french doors open and a grand master ballroom straight out of the sixties awaits your every sinking appetite. Beus and Belles unite! This is a  real ball! Candlight sessions held every thursdays at 8:30 p.m. Also used as a meditational facility for the poor., 1
What a great idea, 1
The Good:  I like the vibe of this place, 1
So they just did a complete makeover on this Thrift Store and I've gotta say, 1
Genna's has quickly become a favorite place to stop after a dinner or show downtown. It's got a cool atmosphere, 1
I remember the day I started liking blue cheese.  it was a long time ago, 1
One of my favorite lunch places. It's within walking distance from my office and has great burgers for a good price. I usually get the bacon cheeseburger combo. For 5 bucks (including tax) you get a generously sized burger, 1
After a nice dinner at Carlsbad Tavern, 1
I gave D'lish a second chance and the service was much better this time! The guys who work here are funny, 1
This restaurant renewed my interest in Vietnamese cuisine (after being disappointed in last couple Vietnamese restaurants I've tried). It's out of the way a bit, 1
Always a plus to have a 24 hour restaurant in your hotel...especially if it's close to the elevator and has good food.  Solid food, 1
Beautiful studio in the heart of uptown Phoenix. The staff is super friendly and so dedicated to this venue. You'll love the beautiful changing rooms, 1
This place is great & is 24/7. I love their Pot stickers, 1
There is such a large assortment of teas here. I am admittedly new to teas, 1
Enjoyed my first and only visit.  Great service, 1
This is a fun place to get a drink or something to eat.  Busy, 1
The Roasted Bean was me and my friends hangover cure from a long night of parting in Las Vegas .  It's a nice upper end Caf\u00e9 that's a lot nicer than Starbucks the offer some pretty good and large pastries.  Prices here are "reasonable" for Las Vegas .  You can get yourself a good size pastry such as a crossant, 1
It's free. It can be busy. It's something you have to see if it's your first time to Vegas...after that it can get a little old.   Not only do you get to see the fountains but you get to endure the crowds of people on the evening who want to get a piece too!  A good tip is to try to see the fountains looks out from the Bellagio - the crowds aren't as bad :), 1
Home of a surprisingly good fish fry on Friday nights. No wait, 1
This is a small family owned Thai spot in a strip mall in Vegas.  A few tables are located in the small space.The people who eat here usually are Thai and are talking to the wait staff and the owner. I definitely recommend take out.   The food here is awesome. I've never had a bad dish. This is my go-to curry joint. If you are near the area for lunch they offer a bunch of specials.   Definitely solid, 1
As far as Jason's Deli goes, 1
Halcyon is a gem of a restaurant, 1
Really cool place to hang out and/or to study because it's open 24hours and has comfortable seating area and good snacks! I used to spend so much time here back in the days :), 1
The list of things that makes this place awesome can go on and on.  The service is top notch, 1
We were happy to find a place to get a good waffle.  The omelette I ordered was good, 1
*This review is for hardcore foodie who is not bound to Americanized-Asian food.  I have tried this restaurant numerous times and I must say I am usually quite satisfied in terms of the value, 1
Vdara is such a cool hotel! There is no casino here - so it's a lot quieter, 1
I sat at the bar and had great service and a good quality meal. The bartenders, 1
The tacos de asada were bomb! The guy preparing them was super fast and funny and got the line moving fast. Would definitely recommend. Love to come back and try the tacos de lengua as well. Great snack on the strip while shopping!, 1
This place offers good Indian food and it's good for those times when you crave Indian food and want to pig out on curry, 1
One of the best places/breweries in PHX. They let some of us home brewers have a "brew out" with the Brewpunks. Fretzy knew what was up! Top notch., 1
I love the O.M.I., 1
They have amazing customer service! They helped my fianc\u00e9 and I with figuring out wedding attire for the groomsmen and himself and made it as painless as possible. Would recommend this place to anyone!!, 1
Since I'm from Chicago we have the best pizza, 1
Uhh let's see. Pros and Cons:  Pros  - Nice view of the strip 50 floors all the way to the top - Was in a group so I spent $10 for a couple shots of vodka - Hot go go dancers with high heels, 1
Union is a nice cozy place set on the fringe of Old Town Scottsdale.  The inside has a nice homey feel with booths that have extra throw pillows (love that) and soft lighting and desert scape paintings.  A big drawback is that while half of the seats face the lovely paintings the other half face the kitchen.    The wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places.  The bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form.  They do offer 8 oz pours of wine for about $15 a glass.  Be careful when you order, 1
Absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Im not a fan of marrying in chapels but I reccommend this place its gorgeous! My dad and his wife married here 3 years ago and I can still remember how nice it was. Really looks like a palace!, 1
Marie Callender's the staff is always super friendly and quick to fill your drinks... We always just go for the salad bar it's good for the price... I will continue to go for lunch quick and filling., 1
I take my son here once a week, 1
My daughter and I are always looking for dog-friendly restaurants wherever we go. We were in Chandler this weekend and first ate at San Tan's Brewery (great place! And we were able to bring Max, 1
This review is in rebuttal to all of the complaints from people who are either not owners or if they are owners, 1
Everything is said in the title: first we are pleasantly surprised by the more than generous sized cookies. Being greedy, 1
Threatened Heather with a downgrade to four stars because I and another customer ate all the ice cream.  Still the best place to take your car!!!!, 1
Best dive bar ever. Marcelo, 1
Ate here Feb 13.  If you are at the Venetian for a trade show and you need convenience, 1
I loved that it was relaxed enough we could sit with our dog on the cozy padded seating in front of a beautiful fireplace and enjoy our ridiculously delicious sandwich ( porkchetta). If you are a gingerbread enthusiast...which I am....their dark, 1
The long: This is my go-to Chinese take-out place, 1
I've been to the Burgtary at waterworks mall. This one is equally great. Shakes are AMAZING! Love very one of them! Staff is friendly. We got there during weekday lunch time. Not like the one at waterworks, 1
Very cool divey casino/bar with some of the friendliest people in vegas working there.  Been coming here for years and I never get tired of it.  You get mardi gras beads as you walk in and immediately after someone is there to get you a drink.  A couple of minutes later you are gaming, 1
I came here for a business dinner and there were like 20 of us.  I did some research prior to coming out and every one recommended the Stetson Chopped Salad.  Prior to arriving I couldn't decide if I wanted to order the salad or get a steak since it was on someone else's dime.  Well that decision was an easy one since we had a price fixed menu of sorts and the salad was on there!  We had a few appetizers and they were pretty good.  I just kept waiting for that salad and was afraid after all of the wait I would  be disappointed.  That is far from the truth.  The salad came and they tell you to make sure you mix it well.  I followed instructions and ate.  I must admit it was pretty damn good.  I could make a whole meal from it.  The price fixed dinner had three choices, 1
If you're like me and you don't have a lot of chances in your home town to try new and interesting dishes, 1
A diamond in the rough.  This is a lengthy review consisting of three parts; overview, 1
This place is a significant haul from downtown, 1
They have Yelp & Zagat rating stickers on the window, 1
I've only had lunch here twice, 1
Wally`s is my number one go to place in Phoenix to eat and bring people to when they are visiting. I go to Phoenix a few times a month and I frequently find myself eating here.  Their Gruyere and slab bacon s` mac is to die for. Probably my favorite Mac and cheese ever. And I eat a lot of Mac and cheese. Super good atmosphere for a date and they have great service. They were awesome to us last night and they were busy.  It was Valentine's and we still got timely and great service. Love Wallys!, 1
Love visiting this place, 1
I was introduced to Tokyo Lobby about 3 months ago and I have been coming back on average about twice a month ever since.  I absolutely love this Sushi Restaurant.  I prefer to sit at the bar and not at a table.  Very small establishment, 1
Great vibe great staff oh and good music. The bartenders are friendly and service is fast i came here for a mini vacation and enjoyed it and even Visited this great place quite a few times for there oysters and clams  One of the bartenders "Jamie" was great she told me where the best spots in Vegas are And even helped me get access into one of the pool hotspots This is a great place if your in Vegas and ps. If you eat the peanuts you throw the shells on the floor, 1
Now that I have found you my lovely Peppermill... I will always visit when I'm in town! One of the remaining vintage vegas landmarks, 1
We stopped by Kona Grill today for lunch mostly because we were in the area and wanted somewhere to sit and have a bite.   The Restaurant is comfortable and beautiful. We got there just after they opened so there were not a lot of customers but i suspect it was because we were there so early.   The menu has changed since the last time I ate there so it took me a while to go through the menu. Along with their regular menu, 1
1st time so I had the Signature Menu.  Caviar, 1
PLZ PLZ let me be the 320ish review of this cafe... yaaa .. 1st, 1
Slingshot SOCK MONKEYS!!! La piece de resistance ;D  Honestly, 1
First time shooter: loved it! Professional, 1
At the time I went there was a promotion going on. With a Palm's Club Card breakfast was 5.99, 1
Probably my favorite pastry shop in Montreal. The cakes change every few weeks or so according to the seasons, 1
Stood here for the weekend and had a great experience! There was a very long line at check in, 1
Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Has a lot of character, 1
Ignoring the weight on my conscience, 1
I don't go to Ramen Bar very often because my very own, 1
Normal bar food late night menu. Went there after a basketball game to grab a burger. The atmosphere was nice and the bathrooms are clean. I have had drinks there a couple times too and the small, 1
Great place to come after a night out drinking.  The pho broth is really good here, 1
Second time eating Ethiopian. LOVED it. Got the veggie combo.  Ate it all myself. No sharing here. Cozy with nice enough decor and the folks are very nice. No problem with service at all that some guests had mentioned. Great experience. My new favorite restaurant in CLT on lay overs., 1
I recently started getting gel on my nails as opposed to a regular manicure. I had gone to Polished and had (as you may have read in my other review) a horrible expierence. I then went on a hunt for a new place.  I read a review here on Yelp wherein the person had a bad expierence at Polished too and they found Vanity and highly recommended it. I figured I would give it a try.  I went to Vanity on Sunday morning about 11:30am without an appointment.  They were able to help me right away, 1
Great pizza place. Easily the best one I know downtown. The selection is humongous and a little overwhelming. But just pick one and you shouldn't be disappointed. The service could be just a little friendlier, 1
Not a problem to report. I'm happy. Got a $5 discount since I called first and mentioned that when I arrived. Also got a discount on a filter and a mail in rebate for the oil chance. Top offs between oil changes is cool. Vacuumed my floors. They were all professional and polite and quick on their feet. I'd go back., 1
NO COVER CHARGE!!! $5 margaritas on the rocks are delicious, 1
Nothing special about this Kohls, 1
I have been a proud member since February 2014 and have taken all classes with all trainers. Each class is just as challenging as my very first class.  The trainers are knowledgable yet they will challenge you and they encourage you to set a goal and then follow up with you every time they see you, 1
LOVED this place!  I'm not sure what was more entertaining though: the shadow dancers, 1
From my experience of Rudi's I've always found it to be pleasant inside with a great range of food and, 1
I was looking for an item that they didn't have in stock but I just had to write to say how pleasant and awesomely genuine these employees were in trying to find what I wanted. I didn't end up buying anything but I'd like to say when it comes to making customers feel comfortable they were great., 1
This car wash has passion written all over it. Bays are clean, 1
YUM.. it's "almost" a Jamba.. OK so some may think I am nutz or others may just understand.  Jamba to me is the primo smoothie.. Robek's is a very close 2nd and MUCH closer to home so they get the spur of the moment purchase vs. the trek (not that far really) to Jamba.  Oh, 1
Always enjoy the Teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and no veggies. So much so that it is all I ever order there. However, 1
Peggy and I visited this amazingly good restaurant tonight. In spite of it being booked, 1
Excellent food and side dishes. Service was very slow. There was only one server. But never refilled our water until bringing us the check. Food made up for it. We will try it again and hopefully have better service. Used the $15 for $25 deal with no problem., 1
This shop is on the NE corner of 32st & Greenway and always has a great selection.  It is a small shop but they are very helpful everytime I go inside.  They also post all their guns on gunbroker.com and their website.  I think their prices are a little high sometimes but they have a great variety and service.  They also have a couple of other locations as well., 1
I'm a HUGE fan!  the 1st time i heard 'bundt cake', 1
We absolutely love this place! Not for the health food crowd, 1
I was a bit surprised by this joint. It's neatly tucked away between a Great Clips, 1
McCarran Intl Airport is a very well-run facility. The gates and security checkpoints are easy to navigate and the security personnel are relatively friendly. Compared to other airports in the US, 1
Lunch is an outstanding deal! Two courses for 10\u00a3. The haggis balls had been recommended and they did not disappoint. The calamari was excellent - perfect texture and flavor. We also had the salmon, 1
The best Fine Whiskey list in all of the madison area, 1
Good spot. The store is pretty vast for a Princes Street spot, 1
Mozzarella sandwich ... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!    That is all., 1
Absolutely LOVE Grapes Wine Bar! You can sit quietly with a glass of wine and read your Kindle while the live music plays Friday and Saturday nights, 1
Urige Weinstube - in einem wirklich tollen Ambiente.    Die Bedienung war sehr aufmerksam und die angebotenen Getr\u00e4nke incl. des Weines, 1
Told this was "the best steaks in Vegas" we thought we'd give it a try on our last night in town. Turning up without a reservation was a bit cheeky as this place is always booked out, 1
Really good track. It was in fantastic shape. 3:20 round. The place was empty. Call day before and u should be able to make a deal for a better green fee, 1
Bel endroit pour un brunch. Bonnes assiettes, 1
This place is awesome! Just a little cafe in a business park, 1
A bit out of the way  to get to if you are visiting on the strip, 1
I still haven't eaten here. Its crazy I know but I sure enjoy the black velvets. Ill update this review when I've eaten here., 1
Vous trouverez un bon expresso dans cette cha\u00eene en Am\u00e9rique du Nord ...., 1
The staff is always friendly and helpful if you need to locate an item.  There are many great items to choose from here and the prices are very affordable. I think the one exception is some fruits and vegtables can be a little expensive for the amount you get. I normally don't shop for produce. Depending on the time of year, 1
Great service.  Good food and great place to watch a game!  We go there a couple times a month and always have a great experience., 1
Always on the lookout for a great meal the fianc\u00e9 and I just had to check out Carson kitchen. Everything was pretty much right on point. We started with the bacon jam and the deviled eggs. Both dishes were excellent. The bacon jam would be amazing every morning on a breakfast sandwich with a good runny egg. The deviled eggs were a great contrast to the in your face bacon and smokiness of the jam. Very suttle  on the flavoring but in a nice way.      We also had the rabbit ragu, 1
Southwestern Auto Glass has repaired and replaced my windshields.  I have also referred Sewall to family and friends, 1
YUM!  We crave Asian Cafe Express at least twice a month.  My co-workers and I to drive out to Mesa (from Phx) for lunch.  Yes, 1
OMG this place  is fantastic.  The room is wonderful, 1
I love their pizza here and their ranch is home made. The only thing I would change is the girl who answers the phones is very rude but if your can get past that then this is a great place to eat., 1
New to my side of town. The fried rice is cooked to order with your choice three ingredients.They have two main dishes that cover just about every meat they serve including seafood. The chicken catsu and chicken mochokino (Hawaii popcorn chicken) is what I had this time. Food was great. Service was fast. Brand new building .And I will be back again!, 1
This is one of my most favorite places on earth. I have come here on countless occasions in the mornings, 1
Awesome service! The Geico Rep was great and helped me out and even brought my car to the service department to check my tires and air pressure. When he brought it back they had given my car a quick wash!! Great first impression that's for sure, 1
I pretty much adore the megabus as I don't mind long bus rides as much as most people.  It's the cheapest way to travel if you book early enough and most recently I got a bunch of tickets for free during their "gofree" promo where they gave away thousands of free tickets.   I'm from new york and its the easiest way to get home for me from Pittsburgh, 1
I am so happy to have found a salon so close to home. It's busy as heck in here but there is plenty of room - I normally do not look for the fluff in a salon. I like to get it and out. But I will say the 10-15 minute foot massage on each foot was enough to make me drool and take more time to enjoy! Great menu of choices that are value-priced - 25 for a basic pedicure. WOW I will be back! (PS - I hope to get a great recipe for Vietnamese Pho from them on the next visit!), 1
Let me first say that I came in with really low expectations.  Have had really bad sushi before. Well, 1
My friend and I enjoyed dinner during restaurant week here the other night. We made a reservation which I recommend doing. We got a great table outside and got to people watch. We had a 3 course meal for $40 and it was delish. I started with the Arugula Salad which was a really nice size. Then for my entree I had the Sea Scallops with Caramelized Cauliflower, 1
I've been to quite a few buffets and this one was actually pretty decent in comparison to the ones I've been to. This one does have an okay sushi bar; the sushi is made to order rather than just sitting there, 1
Food was really fantastic and the Sunday atmosphere very chill.   The musician they had was brilliant (Taylor?) and our server was very pleasant.   First time here and have already recommended to two friends before we have even left the restaurant.   Oh and they are dog friendly on the patio apparently... I thought that was a nice touch  Def Wil come back., 1
Kevin has a heart of gold and really loves to play with the audience. He really makes those on stage the stars of the show and does some really inventive, 1
Good eats by great people!!, 1
The flavors are amazing and you can order to your heat taste.  I have never left there with an empty tummy, 1
My silliest housemate was driving us around the other night in late evening.  We noticed this place for the first time because the employees were all sitting out front, 1
Been here many times before.  But last nite, 1
Super friendly, 1
This is the real deal. An old fashion barber shop with always 3-4 barbers on duty. Go on in and have a seat, 1
Me: I'm looking for a 1st Generation Gameboy. GH: We have it. Me:  And a Nintendo. GH: We have it. Me: And a Dreamcast. GH: We have it. Me: And a Calico and Atari and a Familiy Computer. GH: We have it.  Seriously, 1
Ordered takeout from this restaurant. The food was great! Had the chef selection, 1
first time here.  Really good fresh food.  Can't wait to go back, 1
This is a great pub. The staff is friendly and helpful. The beer is cheap and good. The beerpong tables are welcoming., 1
Let me start out by saying that many of the reviews here are unfair. I live very close to this take out Chinese restaurant and have used them many times over the years. It is true that they were better before the change in ownership but they are still pretty decent. This place like many Chinese restaurants does some things better than others. For instance, 1
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE AUSTRALIAN LOBSTER TAIL.  Can never find the same size any where else!!!  Had reservations, 1
Jim has an incredible talent.  He did my Numerology chart and a Tarot reading for me.  He was able to pinpoint exactly what was going on at that time in my life.  I am so impressed with his level of skill that I don't think I will ever go to another psychic!  He has set the standard and I will be returning to him for all my future readings.  Meeting with Jim has helped me tremendously to deal with my issue.  I am so thankful I found him and recommend him to all my friends and family!  Thanks Jim for sharing your gift and helping others., 1
I WISH THERE WAS MORE THAN A 5 STAR I COULD GIVE ELBA!  I  recently moved to Vegas from Miami and been dying to get a keratin done. Ever since I have moved I have not found the right salon or pricing till now. I was able to purchase a Groupon for $68. SUPER AFORDABLE! Elba was an amazing stylist she catered to my every hair need. to think my hair is probably beyond damaged! (PINK AND PURPLE AIR SHORT BROKEN CURLY) but she was able to pretty much do a miracle! As well to say I'm a picky person with my hair not everyone can touch it.   When I called to make an appointment she listened to my every need and question. As soon as we walked into the salon I felt like I was back home. Holiday music playing Christmas tree up for the holidays (ITS PURPLE MY FAVORITE COLOR). Once again this place is beyond amazing Funny Talented and I recommend everyone in the city of Las Vegas to go and try her out!   WE WILL BE BACK!, 1
I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, 1
This is my favorite yogurt place. The staff are always in a great mood, 1
I went to Dr. Dickerson in hopes of one day having straight and white teeth. Being scared to death from past experience, 1
Hi! I am excited about Big Joe's Little Gym, 1
When we want to get our Mexican Restaurant fix, 1
Smart. Funny doesn't cover it. Clever. It's the show I recommend to the out of towners. He never lets me down. They always come back and say, 1
This review is based on the times we have been there for dinner.  I have had seafood stew that is quite good, 1
My boyfriend discovered this place on Diners, 1
So I like the rice dishes here (com) their spring rolls and giant Pho 1b are amazing too.  You gotta try the pork chop or their rice combo plate .  Great!, 1
This location is working hard for your business! The servings are generous for tapas! The mojitos and sangria are excellent! I highly recommend all of their dishes as I've tried almost all of them!  Don't forget to use your bread to soak up the tasty sauces from the plates!, 1
Tuesdays are kids eat free!  I had a great classic burger. Hand pattied chuck grilled to meduim with american cheese and the fixins. Served with a wedge salad with some great blue cheese dressing. Even the bun was great. It hit the spot.   My daughter had chicken strips extra crispy, 1
Great shop. Out front they have an amazing selection of wines and beers - their Belgian selection alone is worth a trip of considerable distance - and through the back they keep their seriously big hitters.  I popped in yesterday and picked up a couple of bottles of Bogle Petite Syrah (not that pricey but not that common either) and got an appreciative grin from the woman serving before she supplied some background to the wine and the producer.  Made me feel pretty good, 1
I can't speak to the sushi, 1
Everytime we are in LV it's the first place we go. Great burgers, 1
We went Saturday night 10/11/14, 1
Filling portions, 1
We stopped going to Red Lobster a while back and after seeing the new menu we decided to try again. I am "tickled pink" to say it is better than ever and we now have a Friday seafood place back on our calendar. The service was excellent, 1
Prices are good and moderate and that Sugar Cane Drink is So Goood.., 1
On behalf of the Lil Saints 12U girls softball team, 1
Went here because I saw as I go to work. So I took the family after church Sunday (10/26). Never had a steak burger. Was not greasey, 1
Great coffee options. A great place to study (free-WIFI) and on a hot afternoon they have huge fans that you can use to cool down.   There's a second floor with lots of seats. The bathroom is very ''decorative'' and even a little scary but was fairly clean.  They have food options (I didn't get to try) but I did order an 16 oz. Iced mint/mocha coffee concotion that was around $4., 1
I guess I haven't reviewed this fine establishment yet, 1
We loved this place for breakfast! Our Pancakes were HUGE and so tasty.  The Snow White omelet (egg white omelet) was fantastic and a MUST try is the Crispy French Toast.  Whenever in Vegas this will be a definite stop!  Yuta (spelling?) is a wonderful, 1
I've often walked by Cartel and been enticed by their chalkboard advertizing all kinds of delicious sounding specials.  So on a rainy Friday, 1
I love me some tacos and I love me some Cherikee Red. Together in harmonious entwinement they make for an incredible experience.  The dudes are friendly and the options varied and creative. Words aren't enough to describe the Thai chili slaw and avocado cream is the stuff of taco dreams.  The truck always pops up when you need it with such brilliantly delicious clairvoyance you'd swear they were tracking your belly thoughts with some PRISM-inspired culinary surveillance.  Never skip it. No matter how long the line.   Don't even think about it. They might know., 1
Excellent show! I came in not expecting much since there are so many variations of Cirque Du Soleil and this one has been around way too long, 1
This is the only Big Dog's I've been to, 1
Drinks are fairly priced and the waitresses are super nice! I don't eat when I come, 1
Kick ass service, 1
This was a solid experience. The guides are great, 1
The croque is amazing. The stuffed French toast is to die for. Have been here several times for brunch and lunch and everything has always been fresh and delicious., 1
Last weekend we ended our cock(tail) crawl of George Street and the surrounding areas in Tigerlilly. The place was very busy with lots of people out celebrating and having a lovely time. It had a really nice vibe and the music was actually pretty good.   I had a pricey but lovely couple of cocktails and we all had a wee boogie in the corner. It is a bit pretentious and overly flashy - you can hardly move for fake appendages, 1
Incredibly delicious food full of lively cajun flavors and spices.  Wait staff was friendly and informative.   My only complaint was I was still very hungry after finishing my meal.  I highly recommend the bronze shrimp and grits but the real treat ( that everyone should experience) is the bananas foster bread pudding!, 1
This is a great find!  We have heard about it for a long time and after going there one night with friends -- We had to go back!  The owner/chef, 1
We had a late night electrical issue, 1
Really good service, 1
I've been meaning to go for a while and finally popped in for lunch with my ladies during restaurant week. A 2 course for $20 is not a bad deal.   They started us off with parmesan crisp and some whipped butter and some water. They gave us room temp and we had to ask for ice a few times as they brought some out a cup at a time to share among us six.   I picked turkey meatballs for my starter. This was pretty good meatballs and the sauce it was in was solid. I liked the ricotta and the onions with it. It needed some yummy bread with it which it doesnt come with though.  Entree I had the Biloxi Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich. A bit messy to eat, 1
Needed a last minute gift so I headed to the Pittsburgh Popcorn Co. on my way home from work. Friendly and helpful staff and it wasn't very busy. Be prepared to be driven close to madness by the amazing smell that hits ya when you walk in.  I thought they did a good job with the Chicago style--my favorite. I've frequently had Garrett's popcorn in Chicago (The King of Popcorn Shops) and this measured up fine. It felt a bit pricey to me for Pittsburgh but it's nice to have a quick, 1
Big Hengs is the underdog restaurant you can't help but love and look forward to coming back for more.  Granted, 1
This hotel is the best place to stay in Vegas! Seriously, 1
We found a nice package deal with "promo##" and got comped cabana ($250-$350 value), 1
Holy crap! I'm not usually a fan of the downtown Las Vegas scene, 1
hit pasta mia for lunch today - solo ( SO taking a nap ) - it's been a very long time since i hit this place, 1
Popped in here for a few drinks after lunch in Stockbridge and was quite impressed.  Great range of beers and spirits available and the bar staff I spoke to were pleasant and knowledgeable.  Was quite a dressy crowd, 1
One of my family's favorite restaurants for Mediterranean Food in Vegas.  We used to live nearby, 1
Although I've only dropped in here a few times, 1
This McDonalds is like any other McDonalds...  however, 1
Best meal I had in Vegas, 1
Cold fudge shake = heaven.  Seriously.  I think it's my favorite cold dessert of all time.    Only give it 4/5 stars because their service is SLOW.  I drank an entire medium cup of coffee while waiting in line to get service.  And I'm a slow coffee-drinker.   The cold fudge shake is so good that it's almost worth the wait, 1
I live near this place and have been here several times.  It's not the best Mexican food in town, 1
I like this bar. Great little happy hour spot.  Love the classic layout and the upscale decor.  Family owned with some great bartenders.  Good selection of craft beers on tap.  Not too many people tap Dogfish Head beers.  Also a good spot for a casual lunch.  Great sliders!, 1
Yummy!!!  Just found this place today. We were told they have been open for about 6 months. Everything is fresh and made to order. I had the veggie burger on wheat, 1
I love this place! Customer service is on point from the hotel clerk to the valet guys! The suite was super clean, 1
I just gotta give these guys the pizza crown. They deserve it. Real NY pizza, 1
Just tried Arepera for the first time today. Glad we took a chance! We went around 6pm on a Tuesday and had the place to ourselves. It was nice and toasty warm inside and I didn't envy the cold looking pedestrians outside. Our server was awesome! He was friendly but professional and very fast. He offered advice on what to order when asked as well. We had a side order of Yuca chips with avocado cream to start. The chips were slightly salty with a tinge of sweetness and a decent crisp to them. Avocado cream (which was given in a squirt bottle for the main meal as well) was great, 1
Really enjoyed the self-design-burger menu. It's a little over-whelming the first go, 1
Largest food menu in Lawrenceville. Incredible signature drinks. Excellent atmosphere. This place just opened up but already my new favorite. This is just what upper Lawrenceville needed. Half off apps during happy hour (mon-fri 5-7 and sat+sun 9-11). Can't wait to try everything on the menu!, 1
Went here for my 1 year anniversary and will be coming back for my 6 year anniversary.   The view is very nice, 1
Woot Woot! A new Caps opened in Phoenix and guess what they are Great! Spectacular! Fantastic! I got the Chicken Cheese steak and it was deli-sh. The Bobbie is my go to but I wanted something hot tonight. This location is across the street from the Sunbrite Corner shops. As with most Capriotti's stores there are the Sandwiches, 1
Food was great as usual however we had a 24 minute wait.  Luckily the crayons and coloring book kept my 6 year entertained while we waited. When the food came it was pretty good., 1
Went in expecting good desserts and ate some of the best food we had in Vegas. Grilled chicken panini and turkey burger were wonderful.  I could not wait to go to this restaurant for chocolate and by the time I finished our meal I was in the mood for cheese cake instead.  It was very good.  My husband's peanut butter sundae was delicious., 1
I went with my bf, 1
Had a great experience on Greek night Saturday. Drew's served the best lamb I've ever had!, 1
The huai du bop (spelling?) at Koi is a must-have when I visit Phoenix (let's just say they know me there). A massive bowl of fresh greens, 1
Great music. Both in restaurant and club side. Food was avg and a little slow  If your short on money seems like they always have some sort of drink deal going on, 1
My boyfriend and I went here for NYE for their special 8:30 PM 7-course meal with wine pairings.  It was AMAZING!  Sure, 1
Since I was in middle school, 1
4 stars to start, 1
Simpy the best deli in Vegas; the liverwurst sandwich is my favorite. However, 1
Worth a stop in as they are about a 1.00 cheaper than even fresh and easy, 1
Honestly I was skeptical at first but I'm glad to say that I was blown away! Located in a little shopping arcade I was about to drive by. But spurred by my friend and my grumbling stomach brought me to it.  We got slightly confused on how the ordering worked. We parked our car and walk around a bit but a helpful employee directed us to order at a window.  The staff was amazingly nice and helpful.  I ordered a quesadilla and a lemonade drink. The food came out quickly and the chef/owner threw in some goodies for us.   Over all my experience was great. I am hesitant to give a full five stars because it is my first time there but I will soon be returning :), 1
This is a great park that overlooks the I-515 / I-215 interchange. It has connections to the Union Pacific Railroad Trail, 1
TWENTY STARS! An International Treasure!!!  This is one of the most amazing collections that I've ever seen. Plan on spending several hours here. I spent three, 1
So excited to have a sushi spot downtown and it's so yummy!  Bocho special roll was so tasty, 1
WOW!!  Best food ever!  Amazing!  Beautiful peaceful patio with lovely waterfall in the middle of it, 1
I am a fan! Recently moved close to Cafe diem and have been quite a few times and each time have been very happy with my food and service. The Crab Cake Benny is delish once I make a few personal changes, 1
It sure is a good feeling when you hit and establishment, 1
I went to get my right tragus pierced, 1
Lots of options at this Farmers Market for any type of personality. From organic vegan items to farm raised beef and chicken - to allergy alleviating honey and herbs that help with just about any ailment - to farm fresh produce from local farmers, 1
Long line at Starbucks today. As always service was friendly and coffee was tasty (and needed)!  I appreciate it when the service is friendly even after a long line of crabby people. Thanks Guys!, 1
I know this place is closed, 1
I came in and sat down to look at the menu, 1
Oh my, 1
liked the location around the San tan mall and this one is just as awesome. definitely more geriatrics at this one but way better seating and much shorter wait times. I guess to offset the blue hairs they hire exclusively high school girls to serve, 1
The Albanach stands out from other other traditional pubs in the area because it puts a modern twist on its decor, 1
The best thing about coming to Chinatown district for auto repair is that it costs half the price of auto repair services anywhere else in the valley.   This place is a little difficult to find because it's located behind the Tofu Hut restaurant. It's not very visible from the streets.   What I like the best about BUSY BUGGY is that they answer questions, 1
Burata was amazing, 1
I come here because it's close, 1
Had the chicken Philly for lunch today. It was great!!  I got to sample a jerk rice bowl which was spicy and very flavorful. Will definitely be back to try other menu items when I get the chance.  Very friendly staff, 1
Awesomely hot food!  You gotta try this place!, 1
On my quest for best pastries in Montreal, 1
i recently started running after having danced or swam for the rest of my athletic life.  the guy who helped me knew the implications of this on my legs and helped me find shoes that could compensate for uneven leg development.  he showed me some simple exercises to strengthen the muscles that the other sports never touched, 1
These guys are great to work with.  Easy to communicate with and get an appointment.  They were on time.  I had a bunch of small electrical issues for them to work on, 1
Cool night club on Freemont Street in Downtown Vegas.  It's part of the Golden Nugget and the outdoor balcony overlooks Freemont Street.   From Thursday-Sunday, 1
I'm a FAN!  I'm not a big pizza eater, 1
Indian Paradise is my favorite buffet in Phoenix. I was thrilled to find Indian Paradise 2 just opened down the street from my office.  Located right at the NE corner of I-17 and bell, 1
Service - 4/5  We were the only ones dining on a Saturday night at 6:30 p.m. At about 7 p.m. there were approximately 6 other parties. One server. He was very nice and apologetic about his service. We ordered dessert ant it did not come out until about 12 minutes. We canceled the order and they comped it out.   Food - 4/5 Papaya salad was fresh, 1
I have been eating here since they opened 10 years ago. Very good consistent food at an amazing value. The owner Sam is there most of the time and takes good care of his diners most of whom are neighborhood regulars. We get take out from here every week and have tried most of what is on menu at least once. If you are unsure what to order definitely consider the various family  dinner options and come hungry. Easy parking, 1
Visiting the Vegas Strip can prove to be a financial burden for anyone who has to be on a budget. So my friend and I decided to check this place out. Arriving there at 3:00 p.m., 1
Extensive menu with options galore. Wonderful ambiance. Pleasant staff and priced well. Side note: personally, 1
sick  that is all i can say badass!!, 1
The carne asada Vida burrito was pretty decent, 1
What can't be faulted: Food and coffee are terrific. Especially the coffee. Also, 1
It's official.  The D has secured the title of "second-best-place-on-Fremont-St."  The Golden Nugget is still firmly holding on to first place.  But considering where they came from (the old, 1
Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh.  Certainly in terms of overall experience.  The presentation of the sushi was incredible.  Even standard rolls (avocado) were better than I expected.  They have some really interesting speciality rolls, 1
Had a heck of a time finding a box that has flexible schedules, 1
We tried Grassroots for the first time tonight and loved it! My wife went all vegetarian with a portobello sandwich and a side farmers vegetable chop.  I didn't think I'd like either, 1
Extremely fast and friendly service!, 1
One of the only true sit down Mexican restaurants close to campus. The cornbread that they give you the beginning his very excellent. And the enchiladas are also good themselves. A good place to take someone on a date!, 1
Dinner on a Wednesday was great -- excellent food and attentive but not overbearing service. Parking a bit of a problem., 1
They have great burgers and sandwiches. Definitely a place to come back to. Not too much parking around that isn't an hour parking., 1
Reading a couple bad reviews while waiting at sky harbor and had to write a review. I don't think I ever had a bad experience here. It's always clean and the airport staff is always friendly., 1
the rooms are huge, 1
I've had not one, 1
Came here with the family after the UFC fight on a Saturday night late (!!), 1
4years living in AZ looking for good Chinese food & I think we found it. First time here and this place is delish and the service is great. Jose was awesome!! The citrus chicken & veggie noodles were my favorite., 1
We really enjoy the food and the service at this cafe. Great portions, 1
I just finished a green chilie pork burrito from New Mexican Grill.  First time I have been.  It was absolutely delicious!!!  The owner was very friendly and welcoming; he explained all about his food and what set it apart. They prepare the food in front of you so there is no mystery there.  Can't wait to go back and try their breakfast burritos!    Hooray for great Mexican food in Gilbert!, 1
I really like Sprouts but I only come to this specific Sprouts location when visiting the Bookman's next door. When you first walk in, 1
I was looking for a nice place to take my girlfriend for her 28th birthday on April 25th. She loves seafood so after reading all the reviews about Wildfish I thought I would give it shot. The place is everything that people said in the other reviews. It is a pretty fancy place but not snooty. I would've gave this place 5 stars, 1
My long-time fave for Ethopian in the PGH, 1
I tend to go to Hash House as my go-to "Oh god we're starving we just off the plane ehhh I don't know what I want, 1
Daniel provided a lovely dining experience. Every need was catered too! The service was superb and the food was beautifully prepared. The restaurant is gorgeous., 1
It's been a little while since I've eaten hear but the food is excellent.  It gets a little noisy if they seat you by the bar area so I recommend getting seating away from the bar.  Overall, 1
I just got back from the Relax Station Foot Spa and can't wait to go again.   I GPSed the address but still had a tough time finding it. Gilbert needs to wise up and put business addresses on signage out by the street. After two wrong buildings, 1
One of my favorites.  It's a bit expensive, 1
The first time I went to Rito's, 1
Nice cozy sports bar.  Didn't have the food here, 1
The $8.99 salad bar-with-appetizers lunch is a huge win if your real goal is to eat a solid, 1
Good selection and prices., 1
went here a week ago with my bf. first timers. we got the hotel based on jetted tubs. why mandalay? well, 1
Five Stars to the MAX!  Honestly, 1
I had a great experience with this shop.  After my husband experienced his fourth auto burglary, 1
Went here again yesterday and was blown away again by the service and the food. The managers that work here are very professional, 1
I just moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles and I needed to find a great a place to get my eyebrows threaded. ASAP! I found Javal Brow Bar on Yelp, 1
I flippin LOVE this place!!  Granted, 1
HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Not enough seating to handle a busy rush.  LIKE  The fluffy snow cream. The fun special combos. Easy to navigate menus. Space is clean and modern.  LOVE  The logo and the branding. The popping pearls. The awesome co-founder Jef Salazar., 1
Being in Charlotte the last 15 weeks I needed a new place top stay that was not going to show up as a huge expense to my client but better than the HGI.  Welcome to the Double tree.  Located right off the West Trade Street exit on 77 South it's easy on easy off.  The hotel is on the edge of the "happening" area of the city but there is a trolley that runs every 10 minutes up to 10(ish) nightly or a 5 minute cab ride to some of the best restaurants in the area.    The hotel has nice rooms that are clean and spacious.  The bathrooms have the Kholer water saving toilets and the giant water saving shower heads with good pressure.  The other thing I love is a good heating and cooling system that evenly cooled the room.    The bar is small but I am never there except for a quick nightcap.  You have a choice of getting the extra points or breakfast vouchers.  Here is my suggestion that works every time for those that stay in the same hotel for weeks at a time.  If you are there for a week, 1
I read a few yelp reviews before checking this place out, 1
The movie is a hilariously cursory and jingoistic history of Montreal. And you can get lost in the lower level at this place! (In a good way.) The temporary Marco Polo exhibit wasn't particularly exciting and seemed to have zero connection to Montreal, 1
I love this store!!!! I wish they had 1 in California. This is the closest one to me!! So I only come out here once a year, 1
I came one day for the lunch buffet as it was my first time eating indian food. Lunch is buffet only. The food was very good and fresh. I highly enjoyed the multiple dishes I had. Would def. go back/again., 1
Have you ever been hesitant to review a place, 1
I was sold at "fat free tuna fish." There aren't many sandwich shops that make tuna fish sandwiches with fat free mayo and yet it's so simple to do so! Luckily, 1
Had to get a lot of blood tests done for a physician who ordered a fairly comprehensive battery of exams.  I was given the check off lists of exams that needed to be performed and to stop by any of the Quest Diagnostics locations around Las Vegas.  This particular location is identified as the closest office based on the zip code I provided when calling their toll-free number.  I went just after noon on a Tuesday and was expecting a long painful wait without having scheduled an appointment, 1
I've been here 4-5 times since I yelped them.  I've got 3-4 people from my office going here once a week now.  When I reviewed them I gave them a "You've been Yelped" card.    I was back recently and mentioned yelp.  I've shaved off my beard since I yelped them.    So the guy at the counter was like, 1
Recently returned from Vegas and what is a bachelorette weekend celebration without seeing the Chippendales?! I was a little nervous, 1
The best thing about this place is the music....the food is good and inexpensive but if you like good, 1
This is NOT the same Grimaldis that is up on 59th Ave & 101 in Glendale.  The Grmaldis here in Peoria claims original roots to the famous Grimaldis in New York.  Extremely thin "Neopolitan" pizza is served up here and it was quite good.  Good quality cheese, 1
Where do the locals go to eat Mexican? The same place we send the tourist to! Smilz Frank and Lupes is authentic Mexican food. There outdoor dining area is the preferred seating  The Margaritas are a "must have"  The Mole is absolutely delightful! Not too spicy -- but so very flavorful!, 1
The staff at this location is fantastic. When there was a mixup at the national level, 1
My friend told me about this small vietnamese gem.  The food and quality is amazing.   I like the #1 pho. It's soo tasty good.  And I absolutely love the their dessert :), 1
Okay let me start off with what turned me off. What i hated about this place was how the workers in front act. I had paid for skip the line passes, 1
Planet Fitness is a great small gym to go to if you are looking for low cost and can get by without having every piece of workout equipment.    For $10 a month you have access to treadmills, 1
I know what you're thinking... 5 stars for taco bell??? Yes!! Of course this is biased, 1
We went to the Urban Sip after having a fantastic meal at BLT. My friends had been talking this place up, 1
These people are amazing. Really who else would want to stick people with needles the size of Mcdonalds straws? Fill saddle bags for Harley's with warm blood.... all day long.   The people from the front desk all the way to the needle poker are all great.   The place was clean adn the wait was short!, 1
So quick and she is super friendly. Excellent at waxing!!!, 1
I love this mini Starbucks! It's right near my pad and it has a drive through that moves fast -- thankfully. And the people who work at this location are characters. Sometimes the baristas will sing to you before they take your order or they'll tell you a joke. This is seriously the wackiest group of people I've ever encountered at a Stabucks, 1
Best. Mexican. In. Phoenix.  Having grown up in LA, 1
Best Mexican food around the area!! Great service and amazing food. Clean and clean bathrooms as well. They have some of the best shredded beef tacos I've ever had. Everytime I've gone I get exceptional service an amazing food. I go every time I'm craving Mexican food!!, 1
I can"t say enough how I appreciate how honest this shop is. I"m new to the Vegas area and had a older Suburban and really didn"t have an idea what was making a strange noise in the front end, 1
Sister restaurant to Joe Beef.  We were seated outside in the back section of the garden with a lovely view of the sky. The menu is written on a chalkboard as it changes daily.  We had the shrimp polenta as the appetizer...delicious!  For entrees we shared the hanger steak, 1
I flew from Reno to Las Vegas via US Airways and had layovers in Phoenix for nearly two and a half hours both times. I remained in the same terminal I landed in, 1
Sticklers is a great spot to grab a good sandwich! The Traffic Jam is my favorite. Get everything on it!!!, 1
Almost 2000 reviews with a 4 1/2 star rating.......I thought hmmmm  Honestly, 1
Love. Love. Love this place everytime I am in AZ it is a must. Great food and service.  The wings and pizza are amAZing...from thin crust to deep dish. Go early., 1
Great locals bar! Friendly environment and decent prices for alcohol. This is not a touristy place this for locals wanting to escape the tourist side of vegas. Cute and cozy., 1
(My Mobile Tip) Wow. These guys are seriously friendly! I have like 4 different menus to take back to work.    I ordered the lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki Box - $7.25.  You get a lot of food for the price you pay!    The chicken teri was not overly sweet or breaded.  The dumplings (goyza) or some may refer to this as potstickers, 1
Cuisine has never been particularly synonymous with Dutch culture, 1
Mmmm! Number 2 with extra onions and a root beer...yes please!! In-N-Out known for their incredibly delicious burgers and outstanding customer service. Walk in or drive thru the service is fast and efficient. I don't think I've ever waited longer than 5 minutes for my food. Even on a busy night. Try the secret menu which isn't such a secret anymore. ; ), 1
I like the ice cream here...taste so good...this place is always busy..the service is ok..but the price is a bite expensive..., 1
I'm very picky when it comes to pizza, 1
i love there food they have the best orange chickin ever and the lady is allways supper nice, 1
PUB is Such a great find. They have custom $14 bloody mary's so Evan and Andrea seemed to enjoy spending 20 minutes with the kilted "Bloody Mary Girl" picking out their combo. Perhaps this had something to do with her giant bazoombas? Mor me, 1
The food was very, 1
A great place to bring friends and family for hearty sandwiches, 1
The selection and hours are enough to earn a few stars in my book. But any place you can get a pierogi pizza and six pack of Four Loko on a Sunday gets my approval. The best pizza in Greenfield, 1
I give Wendy's a higher star because there are no Wendy's in the QC, 1
Last week I went to T. Cooks during Restaurant Week. Since then I've struggled with how to approach this review. There have been 3 or 4 drafts written and all scrapped. I think the best way to get after this one is to break it into sections.     The Resort:  For those who don't know, 1
I'm on the edge of 3 and 4 stars here. We have been here twice now and neither time has been bad. The staff is very nice and the flavor is solid. A few key things for me here; the first time we came the beans were good but the second time they were bland, 1
We received the BEST service in all the restaurants I've been to in Charlotte, 1
This place is incredible inside. It a very romantic setting with dim lights & a red hue. It's definitely a classy place. I started with a fruity mixed drink & didn't love it.  The bread that came out was fantastic, 1
The menu is fun, 1
They have a great breakfast that is very inexpensive., 1
Ok. So while I was waiting for my pizzas at Pizza Hut, 1
I am constantly surprised at the great restaurants I keep finding in Las Vegas.  Just when I think I have found all the good ones...!  Shuseki (none too modest of a name!) is an Izakaya (tapas if you will) type restaurant.  However, 1
Awesome first experience!   So I walked in with no appointment and my Lens crafters glasses in hand with a broken nose pad clip.  The staff member came out as soon as she heard the door chime, 1
Came here upon my cousins recommendation. Glad we did. We sat outside on the patio because it was unbearably cold inside. The chips and salsa were different than ive ever had: crispy, 1
I'm a hookah lounge snd music aficionado and this place is everything I could ask for under one roof.the atmosphere is a beautiful Arabian nights theme, 1
It's 2pm, 1
Great dim sum on a rainy Wednesday afternoon. Staff was friendly/polite to English speakers. Really enjoyed roasted pork bun., 1
I went back and had bottle services this time. The lead VIP guy hooked me up! ask for Anthony Mendoza! I was so happy with the serivce. It was well worth the money! Our bunny was awesome and let us take pictures with her all night. She swooped in anytime we tried to lift a finger. Securty came over and introduced himself to us when we got there and made sure no one sat at our table. We killed our bottles early in the night but they never hassled us about buying another one. We even ordered mixed drinks alter and they never charged us more. I know some clubs that charge a permium and make you order another bottle. I would definitely come again and highly recommend it!, 1
The Bellagio is five stars all the way IF you intend to spend a substantial portion of your time in the resort and casino, 1
They are  family owned and they not only do dry clean... But alterations as well. I take all my baseball caps here too. Don't hesitate. They do good work., 1
I've never done barre before but have heard great things about it. The only problem is barre classes are a little pricey and more than what I'm willing to spend each month no matter where you go. When they had a Living Social deal for 5 classes I jumped on it right away. I attended the Saturday morning classes and had Kelly as an instructor except for one day when we had a sub since it was her birthday. I enjoyed all of the classes. The hour went by really quickly because you were constantly moving and doing new exercises. I had a lot of fun and got a great workout too. I was so sore after the first class and felt it for a week! The class size usually had no more than 10 people. I really liked this because you get the individual attention in a group setting.  The studio and equipment was all new and clean. The dressing room was equipped with lockers with locks and keys which was very convenient. I would definitely recommend this studio to anyone looking for a great barre workout. Maybe one day I can afford to go back without a deal., 1
This was my first Cirque du Soleil show ever and had read many review saying it was more "theatrical" than the others (which is true...I later on saw La Nouba in FL a month later), 1
I give this place an average of 4.5 starts. This place has veryyy gooddd ribs (5 stars). They are full of flavor and they fall right off the bone. The menu isn't big at this place. They have ribs in one flavor and one or two pork sandwich options. Best of all, 1
We booked a room at Mandalay Bay, 1
Ugh... shut up and take all of my money. This store is adorable. I love the selection of dresses and accessories. You can find a lot for yourself or great gift ideas.   They have a strict return policy about only getting store credit. Kind of stinks but I wouldn't return anything I've bought here. But if you buy a gift that is something to think about.   Love it. I will be back for more!, 1
Yes I love Jets in general. This location is no exception. Story: One of the delivery guys couldn't find my house and called me a bunch of times and i didn't hear it so I didn't pick up. Naturally I looked at my phone after it had been a long time. I called and told them it was my fault but asked if they could bring back the pizza. They brought me the old cold one and also a brand new one. They have excellent customer service and deliver fast and easy! I would recommend this Jets location!, 1
Love this place.  Fantastic fish. The last time I ate there I had the sashimi tuna salad and I was raving about it for days....tuna, 1
I took my wife and 2 small children (2 and 4)  to Serendipity 3 at 330PM on a Saturday. The friendly hostess took our names and told us the wait would be around 45 minutes - and 45 minutes later we were being seated at our table.  Wow we had a great time. My kids were entertained by Kyle our happy and friendly server. We ordered the Empire State Onion Ring Tower to start - it came sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and two dipping sauces.  My wife then ordered the Serendipity Chicken Salad - the "signature" salad - dressing on the side because it is very saucy. I ordered the chicken pot pie, 1
The best place to start with this review:  outstanding service.  I recently had Deborah from Espree out to a property my buyer clients were purchasing.  The home had recently had a leak in the garage, 1
So....it does not have the full menu options like that of a regular paradise bakery. IT is still great and has the basics, 1
Outstanding food and service! We had a large party for brunch, 1
The food and service were really good; even on a Saturday night there were no long waits to be seated.  In Scottsdale that's a privilege. We'd definitely go back again., 1
Beef short ribs are melt in your mouth., 1
From the moment I talked to Marcie on the phone to hearing her tell me to take care as I was leaving, 1
LA MEILLEURE POUTINE EVER !!!  T-rex !!!  Un peu serr\u00e9 comme restaurant mais super bon et gras \u00e0 souhait haahha!, 1
Just graduated from VW to Audi at Audi of North Scottsdale and the experience from start to finish was top notch. John Jimerton provided excellent guidance and customer service throughout the entire process which included trading in my VW. I wasn't able to take the new car with me the first night once I had settled on it due to time constraints, 1
I hadn't been to an Outback in years but their new ad for Steak + Crab for $13.99 had been calling to me for awhile. Steak and crab under $15? Right up my alley!!!  Dinner started with a loaf of the brown bread I had such an obsession with in my childhood. It was way smaller than my husband or I could remember and sad looking. Husband tried it and said it has gone downhill. Bummer but I wasn't here to eat bread anways.. I was here for the freaking meat and crab!  6 oz sirloin + 1/2 lb of snow crab + potato (I subbed green beans) for $13.99. I was scared the sirloin would be tough or the crab legs would be brown and mushy like the ones at Hooters. Nope, 1
I had the Manza sandwich, 1
Not my style, 1
I live just up the hill from Istanbul. Used to come here when it was open - not often, 1
I don't know much about tattoos, 1
Burgers are Great.  Smashbuger is great.    I stopped in here last week for the first time thinking that I had already tried it.  Obviously I had not enjoyed this establishment because I would have remembered the amazing fries.    They turned the ordinary burger into something a bit more special with their egg buns and great types of burgers to choose from.  Yes chuck box is just over, 1
Wanted to go to an Alan Ducasse restaurant for, 1
Confession Time. Authentic Mexican food places intimidate me. I am very interested in trying out new things but rarely do because of the language barrier. The staff at Taco Taco are the nicest most helpful staff I have ever had at an 'over the counter' restaurant. My first time in they took the time to explain the entire menu and let me sample all the different meats. It was a great experience. I settled on soyrizo.  The food is excellent. As a confused white guy I think of Taco Taco as a chipotle style establishment with real Mexican tastes. I make a point to stop by and try something new whenever I am on the east side., 1
our waiter was awesome!   i had the steak fajitas and they were totally over priced at $18 but some of the best fajitas ive ever had!!! i didn't eat any of the sides or tortillas because the meat portion was so large and that was my favorite part.  (that's what she said!)    this is a fox concept i will happily, 1
Tried the fried egg burger. Delicious!  My wife and I are really starting to like this place. I would recommend giving it a shot!, 1
Grimaldi's serves up some of the best pizza I've ever had, 1
Note: this review is only for the macaroons  So I love macaroons and when I heard that this place had a great selection, 1
I'm a BIG fan of Los Taquitos! I've been searching for a nice hole in the wall taqueria since I moved from California in 2009. .   The tacos are superb. You can mix and match meats-carne, 1
I would have thought that by getting into an automobile accident, 1
So ein schnuckeliges cafe. Leckere kleine Kuchen und der Kaffee ist auch sehr gut. Sehr zu empfehlen, 1
Just got their gyro combo and their hommus. Gyro was HUGE, 1
I really like this store and have been going here for as long as they have been open. 18 or 19 years. It is always exciting to be rewarded for the products you buy. The more you spend the better prizes they have. They really have a very  good reward program. I love the gifts they give with the fragrance purchases @ different times of the year. They put out great coupons all the time which always helps with a purchase. I have tired the salon a few times in the past but, 1
It was one of those unanticipated nights, 1
Got the recommendation from a friend at work. When we got there it was just before 3pm. My wife Lori and I decided to come on a Tuesday because of the 25% off the entire menu and drinks. There was hardly any one there. We were promptly seated and our server Dave came over, 1
I absolutely love Andy Warhol and love this Museum. If you're looking for a classy date in the burgh try going on Friday Night when they frequently offer wine and cheese tastings, 1
Chef crepe was amazing, 1
This place just opened up near the salon that I work at and let me tell you, 1
i had soooo much fun here! i was inside super fast and super easy, 1
So while in Vegas, 1
Thai food is my jam yo, 1
EVERY time I visit Las Vegas, 1
Still delicious, 1
Delicious food with an artisan flare. The goat cheese crepes were great! Friendly, 1
I was told about this place from a co-worker. Thanks buddy. My new favorite.  I have 99% good things to say about this place, 1
Great discovery for me!  I popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  I had the best veggie tacos ever!  They were extremely flavorful and filling.  I don't know the secret to the accompanying rice and beans but they were also on point...just delicious!  The only drawback is the size of the place.  Since I dined alone, 1
Don't let the fact that it's a $5 pizza fool you - this pizza is awesome! Best crust in Tempe. The wings could be better, 1
Best breakfast in Phoenix. Great prices and you will not believe how much food you get and it taste great. If the line looks long don't worry you will not have more than a 20 minute wait. At least we never have and we go every weekend. Our favorites are the chicken fried stake and the breakfast croissant breakfast. You will have leftovers with any meal you choose., 1
Welcome to the neighborhood Yummiville!  You have just became our new favorite yogurt spot. Good quality yogurt for us yogurt snobs and priced great for the price sensitive yogurt shoppers..., 1
I'm not much one for gluten-free or organic food, 1
it was one of those nights where you weren't sure how long it was going to take to get in, 1
Pink's is located near PH towers so I was finally able to see what the hype was all about!!! It's really small inside, 1

Burger was the bomb!, 1
A few things need to be considered about Student. It's free. The people who write for it do it for free and it's distributed round campus every Tuesday for free. Secondly, 1
I will say this for Super Mex: they're consistent. They're nothing spectacular, 1
This place was great! There were quite a few people in there who seemed to be regulars, 1
Best BBQ wings we've had in a long time!! The White pizza was delicious with fresh tomatoes and the barbecue chicken pizza is tangy and amazing. The only item I wasn't too impressed by was the mini pizza cookie....a little burned and ice cream tasted like the old box kind., 1
$$$$$$$, 1
Got a coupon for a 2-for-1 dinner, 1
I saw the same stylist for 6 years.  So needless to say I was nervous to go somewhere new. BUT, 1
Great pizza and quality live music. Two of my family members are vegan and ordered the meatless sausage and meatball sandwiches. I had a bite of both and they were delicious. The owner recommended her original handmade vegan cheesecake. It was excellent. It wasn't on the menu yet so you may have to ask for it., 1
so good one of my favorite ice cream places in general =), 1
wait.... i keep reading other reviews and they all paid less than i did for teh steak and eggs... i got it for $8.99!?!?!?!? WTF! dang...  oh well, 1
I had an entire Sunday afternoon to kill before my evening flight home, 1
Great beer selection!, 1
If you need to stay near the Phoenix Airport, 1
Yay! I heart Pet Club.  They are the closest place to south Scottsdale for horse tack and supplies (other than Tempe Feed, 1
This is a beautiful trail in a wonderful regional park.  Easy parking, 1
All I can say is yum. Best food I have had in a long time. This will be my go to place when I am in town., 1
The Cantina 1511 burger, 1
I just started going to this doctor and I will continue going. I like how quick they get you in, 1
Need a place for a girl's night out or a date.. Press is THE place to be! There are so many great things about this place, 1
Shauna is a great massage therapist! Experienced and really knows her stuff. There are a lot of massage therapists out there but few who really know what they are doing. I highly recommend Hands on Healing, 1
We arrived with a large group & sat at the private table in the back.   The service was fantastic - they were on top of all our individual drink orders & kept checking back frequently (and remembered what we were each drinking).  The food was all excellent!  We had so much (family style), 1
For a regional chain, 1
Any time I find myself @ this mall, 1
Something about temperatures in the -30s makes me crave Mexican, 1
My hubby and I visited this new place today for lunch. We got there at lunch opening and it was not full at all which was great for quick seating. It did full up around noon. Patio seating available which would be a nice option when the weather is cooler. Nice decor and ambiance. Casual but also good for lunch during work week. We heard that chef was former chef at house of tricks. So we wanted to try it. We ordered the revival burger and steak salad. Salad came with fries. Portions on both were good. Both entrees were great. Nice flavor on steak and burger. We couldn't stop eating the fries. The women's bathroom was clean and nice but i found it weird that the toilet paper was just sitting on the back of the toilet. Couldn't spring for a holder?? Other than that all was good with this place. Definitely would come back., 1
Chinese done right. The sweet and sour chicken was just perfect. Their crab puffs were unique and very tasty. Their prices are very fair, 1
We sat at a "communal" table which means first come first served in the bar, 1
My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night. I had been to the lunch buffet and it has always been alright. However, 1
My grandchildren love going here. We enjoy the water park, 1
first time at a Dave and Busters. Food was good waiter was good. Price was reasonable portions were just right., 1
This isn't the real Caesar's Palace is it? -Alan from Hangover  The most celebrated casino/hotel in Vegas. I truly like Caesar's Palace; its been at the strip for a long time and has a unique history.  There wouldn't be a Vegas without Caesar's.  I enjoy shopping here and gambling.  I haven't checked out the rooms in the new Caesar's yet .  I recently saw the movie Hangover and now I am yearning to go., 1
This place is delicious! I have never eaten inside the restaurant, 1
Pita Jungle is by far my favorite restaurant in the Valley. I Love the atmosphere at this location and the servers are always friendly. With that being said, 1
Pretty dope complex.  Too rich for my blood but I do have a Dr. friend who lives here and he showed me around.  Definitely a well up kept facility.  The condos are very nice and I only saw a one bedroom condo but it was quite spacious.  The location of Optima is sweet.  Just a stones throw away to the nightlife of old towne!!, 1
Wow! this place is scrumptilicious!!!  Food: Just amazing. I had the Cau Cau and my sister had the Lomo Saltado. Mine was delicious, 1
Great breakfast food! There was a small wait while we were, 1
Hole in the wall in Chinatown plaza. Parking is no issue due to the large shopping center parking lot. I arrived for lunch and it was just before noon  Yummy beef noodle soup! I went with the spicy version without tendon. The broth was rich tasting and the beef was lean and tender.  Service here is average and straight to the point as with most Chinese restaurants., 1
Went in as they were closing and Chad fixed us up right. We had a thorn in our back tire and he replaced the inner tube for us. Sounds easy but not so much when your dealing with an internal gear switch.  Much better and nicer than the bike cafe not to far around the corner!, 1
Good food and great ambience. A bit on the pricey side but otherwise tastes excellent. It's a great place to bring a date with the music playing in the background. For being in vegas and it's location it's not too bad., 1
I regularly go here for lunch with friends Great atmosphere and very clean  The service is excellent every time  Five star bar in Gilbert, 1
We've been going to Don & Charlie's for many years. The food and service is always fantastic. We had never sat at the bar until last night. What a great experience it was. Our bartender, 1
Service is always good. I pick it up for our office alot, 1
No complaints here.  My family usually come here if we can't decide what new place to go or if we just want to stay close to home.  The warm wheat bread they serve with butter is delicious, 1
Shhhhhh....  Don't tell anyone else about this place.  i don't ever want to have to wait in line or share this absolutely wonderful place!  Some call this modern Japanese, 1
This place is beautiful. It's refreshing compared to the smoky chaos of most hotels on the strip. No long lines to check in either. The rooms were beautiful with comfortable beds and pillows and the bath was huge. Very peaceful and classy. Loved it., 1
Among all the buffets that I went to in Vegas, 1
3.5 stars - bumping it up to 4 for generous portions...  Hubs grabbed takeout from Thai Orchid after a very long holiday weekend..I was itching for something spicy and noodle-y, 1
I love coming here for lunch whenever I'm in town. The fish is fresh and the hot line is amazing. The desserts are also on point with a variety of Asian flavored ice creams such as Green Tea and Red Bean. Gotta love it, 1
This place just opened and a friend and I stopped in for breakfast today. We were both very pleasantly surprised by the experience. I had an crepe omelette, 1
BELIEVE ALL THE HYPE!   well in my opinion you prob should! my bf and i were there looking at the line and i was this close to not waiting but my bf said we should just stay. we went on a saturday during their brunch hour. although it was a bit pricey...but hey it IS called a VACATION plus you are in vegas..youre gonna overpay anyways but hey you gotta splurge all that moneyyy honeyyyy!!  we stayed in line for 40mins - which wasnt so bad because the line was moving time to time. i was looking at the lights by the lines and i was getting worried that all those glasses would fall during a earthquake haha. the service was nice, 1
I've been having cravings for living up to stereotypes so when I saw fried chicken aon the menu I was sold.  Of course this is a fancy establishment so I had to have a side of Belgian  waffle with a syrup that had so many fancy things in it, 1
Dr. Lindsey Clyde is awesome. The office was quick to get me in and they are right down the street.  I walked in and the staff was pleasant and everything was clean and nice. Dr. Clyde recognized my boyfriends name from my form and we chatted a bit about that. She is very easy to talk to.   I needed glasses and Dr. suggested to start with glasses instead of contacts. The lady who does the glasses fitting was great to work with because she gives you her honest opinion and says things like, 1
A new fan of this place.  Just wondering around downtown, 1
I've eaten here probably a dozen times at my frequent stays at the Palazzo. It's a step up from the Cheescake Factory which I hear it is owned by? The chicken and waffles are good, 1
In the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes is this little taste of Italy.  I cannot wait to visit the one in New York.  The pizzas are fantastic--margarita, 1
Le Thai is small and very popular, 1
While in Pittsburgh with the hubby for a quick weekend getaway, 1
Been a regular here for lunch and post work drinks for over a decade. Menu is good, 1
I love any art and cluture and being so close to downtown I try to soak up as much as I can. I would love to see the Phoenix Art Museum do more with and to support local artists. There are so many talented people from Phoenix, 1
evo salad was awesome... Waiter was really nice and explained the menu for us, 1
You must come hungry! There are so many choices, 1
A great place to have a quality cup of coffee at a reasonable price.   The location is key - 32nd and Camelback Road.    There is plenty of magazines and newspapers for reading alongside wifi to do your work.  A great combination to let you sit, 1
The architecture along deserves five stars. When I drive past Tempe Center of the Arts on the freeway, 1
Where else can you get 2 polish sausages, 1
I go to Sugar Bee's when I need a macaron fix. Also, 1
Great movers!  Very nice, 1
I like the new hours Tuesday through Saturday 10:00 AM - 7:00 PM.  This is the place if you LOVE brisket. They have 3 choices of fat content on your brisket, 1
Very nice hotel! Enjoyed the stay!, 1
We had these guys out about a month ago. He was quick, 1
I was brought here by a friend today. I normally steer clear of sub shops because I am typically disappointed. Well...I was VERY pleasantly surprised. Not only were the ingredients much fresher than I've experienced at other sub places *coughcoughcrappysubwayshittyquiznoscough* but he didn't skimp on them.   I was actually full after half of mine and it didn't taste like doughy bread that had been lightly sprinkled with turkey and ham. The cost was also quite reasonable and the service was friendly. I will definitely come back here and suggest this to my picky, 1
This is a classy steak house with an expansive menu. Everything is good and the service is top notch. The calamari, 1
When it's 4am and you've been drinking and gambling at Planet Hollywood and have worked up QUITE the appetite, 1
Rita is absolutely the best in the world; a well known celebrity hair stylist and make up artist. Rita has worked her magic to color correct my damaged hair and make my hair look like "Sun Kissed California hair" with the best highlights I have ever had in my whole life. I can not say enough good things about Rita and how fortunate I am to have found her. Rita is incredibly talented and gives you the star treatment when you sit in her chair. Rita is the only real talent at Globe Salon. Give yourself a star treatment and make an appointment with Rita. Thanks Rita for all your talent and magic!, 1
Follow up to an earlier review:  I have returned several times since the opening of this restaurant, 1
Daily Dose is a fun place to kick back and have breakfast or lunch in Old Town. (I have yet to have dinner here.) I went here with my family a couple of times while they were in town and it has good ambiance, 1
Visiting Las Vegas but meeting up with a group of 15 friends (used to be a local)  we wanted a place to catch up and watch the Blackhawks...  Pizza Rock delivered, 1
I love good sandwiches and Cousins has a Seafood Sandwich that totally ROCKS.  A couple of times they have been out of the bread I like best, 1
So many cool things to see. it definately takes more than 2 days to see everything. 2008 was the first year i've attended and i could see why people would go ever year. there is so much to see and play with.   just make sure to wear comfy shoes.. i was in heels and my feet were hurtinggggggggg..., 1
This is old school hardcore progressive club with really impressive tunes to dance. The DJs were awesome and by my second drink I was spinning on dance floor out of control. The crowd is die hard clubbers who know where good music is. As our hotel concierge suggested best night is Wednesday., 1
By far my favorite Mexican place in Vegas. Courteous staff and great food everytime I go there. Never dissappointed. Love this place and always bring out of town friends/family here too, 1
Sehr guter Schneider, 1
16 party.  Good service because we got there prior to opening.  Always a great mini stuffed pizza for lunch.  I had Number Uno Mini.  Very good.  Last visit pesto mini stuffed was amazing., 1
The concept is simple; pick your meat, 1
$3.50 Bloody Marys on Sunday, 1
Although there's other Aloha Kitchens out here, 1
I first discovered 86d Eats at the fresh52 farmer's market outside of Whole Foods. I love hummus so I sampled some of their pesto hummus and was immediately delighted.  The tzatziki and salsa are also delightful, 1
I decided to try Serendipity 3 because for one the Serendipity in New York is amazing and two frozen hot chocolate just sounded good. I went with my mom and friend who have never been to Serendipity and we treated ourselves to potato skins and a frozen hot chocolate. Just a little note, 1
Great service!!!! Will be back!!!, 1
I love Komol! It is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The vegetarian selection is one of the largest in the city, 1
I had a great time at the festival.  I had VIP access and vodka tent.  Food was great, 1
This restaurant was unbelievably great, 1
Cheap. Get the teriyaki chicken on the lunch menu, 1
Me and three of my buddies stayed at Planet Hollywood and was approached by a doorman who invited us to come in and check it out. We were on our way to meet some other chics somewhere else and decided to come back later in the night.   When we returned we got in with no issues what so ever. I did notice before we went up the escalators that one of the doormen was harassing another gentleman about him having to pay him to enter..I just shrugged it off and proceeded. I thought the interior was just ok..nothing really over the top. The best part is overhead with the sex dancers dancing on a huge net right about the dance floor. That was hott.   I'll be back in Vegas on June 14th and haven't even considered going here it again. You might wanna check it out for yourself..but I've checked this one off as faking along the lines as just another club that will eventually take on a new name soon, 1
Pretty good for Vegas.... I'm a sushi snob from LA/OC and this is probably a 3 star place there. Service was great, 1
With practically everyone downloading music, 1
Capo's is an adorable little old Italian restaurant.  When you first step in you get the feeling your walking into an old mafia movie.  They have a little dark room you step into, 1
This show was just aight for me. It was billed as being at the Sam Boyd Stadium, 1
It's been a while since my first review and things have improved. The projection is better, 1
This was my first time at Jesterz and I was impressed.  They did a great job and I sure was laughing most of the night.  There were only a couple "skits" that I did not think were that funny but for the most part I was non-stop laughter.  The crowd got asked a lot to give suggestions for the show.  It was nice involvement.  Garrett, 1
Its awesome being a girl in Vegas.  1) Never have to wait in line to get into XS  2) Never had to pay to get into XS   3) Free drinks  4) Easy to swoop on a all guys table (Free table) lol  Although im pretty much over the club scene, 1
This is the best movie theater in the world. Why? Because nobody ever goes here. More than likely a result of the light rail or people just not wanting to go downtown for a movie. But honestly, 1
Good lunch with the business-y types of Charlotte. Prompt service, 1
The food is not very good, 1
Abay was my first experience with Ethiopian food. Like a lot of other people, 1
I really like this Pei Wei. We always order online and then pick up the food at the restaurant. The take-out process is fast and easy and the staff are nice and friendly. The food is DELICIOUS! I have never actually eaten in the restaurant but it looks very clean and spacious., 1
Would give 5 but I think the story was slow in some parts and I was tired from a long day of exploring the strip, 1
This is how Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be. Great choice of toppings. Reasonable prices especially for Vegas. The burrata is awesome too., 1
I just went here tonight with the gf (Sunday at 7). We were able to be seated right away and it seemed somewhat slow with only 2 other groups there (though a few more came in as we ate).  I wish I could find an online menu of theirs so that I could list the items that I had, 1
I recently moved 45 minutes away from my old stylist, 1
I'm rounding up to 4 stars because they were nice enough to split our dishes, 1
Casey's is forgiving and she gets 5 stars. I've been going there for ten years and even though I have been kicked out multiple times.. (Using the blarney stone, 1
Being from the SF bay area, 1
I was frantic when my engagement ring broke 1 week before my wedding. I had no idea what to do and who wants to get married with a broken ring? I called Fast Fix and they repaired, 1
I came in here for the first time and ordered one scoop of Chocolate Malted Crunch, 1
Great service and large tvs well positioned for sports. The veggie burger was dry and a little stigy on the garlic fries.   Regular hamburger is good.   Would recommend and would have been 5 stars if the veggie burger was better and less stingy with fries. :). Now that I have given up on Antars this will be my new place for sports., 1
mmmmm they deliver and make your night . LOVE the food, 1
It was a fun little bar, 1
Janis Joplin sang, 1
I have had the burger again, 1
Right from the first few seconds I opened the door to Romanelli's, 1
Great price for a great massage.  Don't let the price of the massage fool you - these are professionals who provide a great service.  They are partnered with a nail salon, 1
I love Pei Wei. My first time visiting this location. My husband and I got the sesame chicken, 1
Always a great place for some homemade brew and hand crafted food!  Good service, 1
Belle petite place. Client\u00e8le tr\u00e8s anglophone. La bouffe est super bonne tr\u00e8s inventive et diff\u00e9rente. Savoureuse aussi mais pas tr\u00e8s abordable... 160$ pour 2 entr\u00e9es, 1
I ventured into Hoi Polloi for a catered event during the AFL CIO conference, 1
Never been here before, 1
Great breakfast. Fast and cheap, 1
I also booked through Tru Cab after seeing their great reviews. I needed a ride to the airport early in the morning (around 5:30am) and booked for a pickup the day before I needed to leave on the website. I received a call within the hour confirming my pickup, 1
These folks have always been cordial to the group of developmentally disabled travelers I've chaperoned in Las Vegas. It's a nice set-up and the food is delicious. It's a great place to meet as a group., 1
I am now a fan and I think weekly how I can go back.  The outside stipmall appearence does no good service to the fine establishment.  The interior was much cleaner and refreshing.  Tables are not overly stacked next to each other, 1
If there's a book on how to run a large restaurant efficiently, 1
Absolutely AMAZING. Definitely worth leaving the strip for! Go for the scallops, 1
This is located right next the Ross, 1
Not a bad spot for some quick southwestern food!  I got the carnitas burrito with lime-Cilantro rice, 1
I Like The giving Tree Wellness center in Mesa. Everytime I have gone in they treat me nicely. It is quiet and comfortable inside. The atmosphere is calm and the staff are friendly.  The meds are okay. I have gone in a few times and came out with some really great stuff. Once in awhile they have some good deals. I come here when I can. I nkow they offer other services besides medication, 1
Phenomenal! Brooke and her staff are educated, 1
This was a very easy 5 stars to give!   The food here was incredible! I went with a small group of friends and we shared 2 starters and 5 mains between us and each one was absolutely delicious!!  The food feels very authentic and the flavours are genuinely magnificent. To begin with we had satay and roti with a spicy dip that all of us agreed we would happily drink as soup it was so scrummy! For the mains we had crispy shredding beef, 1
The Henry was a great experience for us. The vibe is like a combination of "Roaring 20s" combined with mid-century modern. It's done in a very warm and inviting way. The service was excellent. Our server had great suggestions and recommendations for us. The cocktail menu had some interesting and unique choices and the Scotch and Bourbon list was extensive. I had a fig & ginger mule in a hand-hammered copper mug. Delicious! The food was top quality, 1
Best Mac-n-cheese I've ever had. Plus, 1
First off - I love Kaba Curry's cute hippo mascot (Kaba is hippo in Japanese by the way).  Kaba Curry is located in a cafeteria like location on Charleston near the College of Southern Nevada's (CSN) north campus along with other college friendly vendors for Korean food, 1
This review is strictly on the food, 1
Sage delivered the best meal I had while in Vegas, 1
Sitting here waiting for something that my Dr was told was ready and 'no big deal' and 'come on over'. ..eyeball roll... Otherwise everyone is super nice.  Noticing the poor front desk gal juggling incoming calls and trying to call people that have had medications sit for a long period of time. They need to upgrade their systems a bit, 1
Friendliest baristas in Madison, 1
Lovely cafe/bakery situated next to an excellent bookstore. Great atmosphere, 1
Seriously Whole Foods rocks!! I feel so healthy just walking through the doors - what a great selection of everything....from the produce to the bar/deli - Adam (below) is right the olive bar is heaven!! Oh and try the pastries too. I just also found out that their skin care area carries only those products now that are paraben free. =0), 1
This place has closed.  The owner converted it to a Spanish tapas place.  I want Coco Osteria.. It was my favorite spot., 1
By far the best Chinese food in the valley. The interior decor is terribly dated and looks straight out of late 80s early 90s nightclub and lots of ceiling tiles need replacing. Many would view this as a drawback but they don't get the genius. The staff is friendly and familiar. Hot & Sour soup is the best item on the menu. Beef sticks are a close 2nd. The only mediocre dish is the duck. Overall a great place at a great price!!!! Would give them 10 stars if I could, 1
I have been coming here for years. My wife works right up the street so we head here for lunch when we can. I love the Chicken En Chipotle, 1
Don't be intimidated, 1
came for St Paddy's '10.... they threw a block party. closed down the street off the side from the strip. green beer, 1
Very nice for a conference and enjoyable all around., 1
Always my favorite place for lunch or dinner! I traveled all the way from North Dakota and the first meal I have to have is Firehouse! We had the Meatball and the Italian and they were both prefect.  I'm going to try make it back again before my vacation is over!, 1
Mmmm hmmmm shopping. Shoppity shop shop shopping sometimes gets me into trouble. And I like nice clothes. And shoes. And bags. So, 1
Have made two trips here. A strong challenger for the lead of best buffet vs Bellagio and Wynn. Every dish had unique flavors and most are served in unique pots or containers. Favorite dishes: short rib cavatelli, 1
Solid 4.5 stars had the burger and really did enjoy it.  Happy hour is a great deal  on food but drinks are still pretty expensive., 1
So my girlfriend has converted me...it's true.  I use to be solely and totally sold out to Starbucks but Dunkin has changed me.  Their coffee is cheaper, 1
I love NTB. They didn't have any rims, 1
The place is decorated nice and its clean! lol The food is really good! I love spicy food but don't usually find restaurant food that spicy. Smiling banana leaf is an exception!! My husband loves the pad thai on a level 10 spicy but I can only take level 8. The spicy green beans with chicken is my favorite dish (level 8). Yesterday, 1
I ate here my first night in Pittsburgh and thought that the Oakland area was so much cooler than it actually was because of it. The food isn't mind-blowing Indian food, 1
We have been here about 4 times in our traverses to Scottsdale and we always make sure to make time for Sweet Republic. They have unique flavors, 1
Clean and fresh!, 1
Yelp defines 5 stars as "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" I can honestly say that the Domestic Wagyu Skirt Steak I had at Craftsteak really was the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. Were it not such an upscale, 1
Got my haircut last Monday with Michelle & loved her. She was very friendly, 1
5 stars all the way. Considerate, 1
Classic, 1
Typical CVS layout, 1
Can I have your attention please?  EVERYBODY GO HERE!  Why?  Because they have something for everyone.  After my initial review of Sal's, 1
Why isn't this place packed? The food is awesome, 1
So maybe Im the wrong person to review a vegan resteraunt, 1
Great food and great music selection if you enjoy oldies.  We started off with the cheese bread, 1
This place has got to have one of the best views of the strip- super romantic! Drinks were nice and strong but over priced (to be expected in Vegas)... I get that all of the hype is about the view, 1
I dont have much experience on the Vegas dinner scene, 1
If you have a sweet tooth like I do this bakery is a gem. You will find about any and every choice of baked good and sweets you could want. I know they have savory options as well but frankly not a reason I go there. Their fruit tart is excellent as is everything else I have tried. It is a must stop anytime I am in Vegas. Located in the Paris Casino., 1
I stay at the MGM almost every trip to Vegas. It is one of the best values on the Strip.   The beds are comfy, 1
Great food and atmosphere in downtown Cambridge.  We don't have too many small pubs and this is the spot to drop in.  Trying to branch out downtown so wanted to try it out tonight after hockey. Having the scotch eggs and wings and they are great, 1
I finally visited Tea Time Cafe for the first time yesterday. My friend had visited it before and tried a milk tea but she said that she didn't like it.   I've always wanted to visit Tea Time Cafe for a long time because I pass by it a lot when I go out to the Sams Club.  I bought a Mango smoothie with boba and I loved it!!  I plan on visiting it again to try out other good stuff like the Mango Coconut drink and the Yakisoba fries (But without my friend)., 1
I like the HUB!  It's the go-to spot for having a drink and grabbing something to eat. Everyone who works there is attentive to customers and provides great service.  Love the great beer selection.  Prices are right.  Food is always good and much better than any of the area competing restaurant/bars.  Try them out!, 1
The *ultimate foodie* stop on my SW eating adventure this summer, 1
They have been grooming my dog for years and have a wonderful personality for this type of business. My dog never fights me to go and is not kept in the cage.Thanks for all you do!, 1
It's a cute little place. I love the decor and the atmosphere is pretty nice as well. I would say it's a good place to go by yourself to work or read a book, 1
Always fantastic food. well priced and quick service. Tasty!, 1
We miss Floyd's but we also are happy a new business opened in the neighborhood.  I didn't know about this place until I got a coupon in the mail last night. So we decided to try it today.  I tried that concept a few weeks back at the Fired Pizza place and I like it. The ingredients I like in my pizza are kind of... 'eclectic', 1
Yummy!  I love the Kabob - offically Kubideh -  with the mast-o-kahir.  The fresh baked bread (Sorry can't remember authentic name), 1
I LOVE Container Park! Every time I go to Container Park, 1
"I can only speak for the pizza, 1
Awesome spicy tuna rolls, 1
Get the roast pork for sure you won't be disappointed.  Nice and flavorful (unlike some places where the pork isn't tasty and you know they probably parboiled it) and with the good skin.  Char Siu was ok but as a Hawaii transplant it still feels different.  I think  I'm gonna give this place a 4 simply because even though the pork dishes are obviously tasty and well marinated, 1
Honey Whole Wheat, 1
This is a fabulous store! I so completely love this store!  The people are great, 1
I did a check in about how there were honestly 40 High School kids in the lobby/parking lot and we actually got a table for two right away.   We came in and nearly turned around in fear with seeing all those kids, 1
Perfect summer night! Strawberry& Very Berry yogurt on a waffle cone for me.  Birthday Cake on a waffle cone for him.  Oh so good!, 1
Everything we had was wonderful - we even went back twice!, 1
We did not participate in the shopping crawl but next year I will make it happen.  My husband and I did come early to explore the shops on 5th Ave, 1
What!!!!!! Awesome, 1
Since my boyfriend and I both love biscuits and gravy we had to try this place out. Very friendly staff, 1
I had a great experience at Hawthorne's! Adam Mark is a great bartender! He went over the specials and the experiencewas great! I enjoyed the slice of the day which was the crew pizza! Management was great and I will definantly be back!, 1
I've been putting off writing this review, 1
How has no one mentioned the kick ass Coke machine in this store? Now granted, 1
FINALLY... I found our go-to pho place in the West side.  Excellent portion sizes for the price, 1
What a funny little find in Vegas. We decided to forego much of the standard "Vegas" experience in favor of a look into the real Vegas, 1
Loved it! The husband and I both got the gyro sandwich combos. Yeah, 1
My family and I were visiting AZ over the holidays and love to do group activities. I called up Caleb and he helped us set up a group trip for 9 of us. He and Hugo showed up with all the equipment we needed and were excellent teachers. Our group ranged in age and skill level and they adapted to our needs. Ontop of that, 1
Delicious & cute!!!!  Great place for groups, 1
$100 lunch for 2...what the heck did we eat??  I think the best thing about the whole lunch was my discovery of the blackberry mojito...yum-o.  Side comment, 1
Our hotel had a little guide to Vegas on the nightstand and as I scoured it for free and/or interesting things to do, 1
my tan still hasn't faded a bit after almost 5 days. i didn't smell funny after like i usually would from a spray tan. she tanned my legs and face so perfectly. shannon is amazing! :) i would recommend her to any of my friends. i was comfortable the whole time and i cant wait to go back! no complaints here :) thank you shannon :), 1
After both (1) reading some of these negative reviews, 1
Well we are new to the area and had always enjoyed the Happy Hour at the Chandler Mall location, 1
I was unprepared for this. UNPREPARED. Beautiful lasagne, 1

A girl's gotta fuel up before embarking on a long shopping expedition. Thank you, 1
It can be loud, 1
I really enjoyed this place a lot.  Excellent quality food, 1
I went to Blue Wasabi for my first time a few months ago during one of the slower times of the day, 1
Both Stingray locations are great, 1
I bought a computer & wireless mouse / keyboard from them. A good deal / good price / & service.  Thanks., 1
OMG.  The desserts!?!  Need I say anymore?  Went here last time with my friends and we did the arrive/pay for lunch, 1
This place is so nice. I always have fun in this little shop. They have a great selection on baby gear. Its nice to shop someplace else other than Walmart or Babies R Us. If your expecting or know someone who is this is a great place to check out, 1
I don't review companies very often, 1

I had the Tuscan brick pressed chicken which I loved, 1
3.75  Wings ... Yummy Just a tad $$$ Pizza ...  Yummy!  Drinks ... they were OK. The carbonation was off on the Coke and the owner tested it and gave me a "replacement" ... it ended up on the bill anyway. LOL  Sports bar type feel. Nice tv, 1
Good for some family fun. You MUST plan around league bowling. They have leagues almost every night so call ahead. There's always plenty of bowling balks & shoes, 1
I like to bring my niece here. It's a fun place, 1
Went to this place after I drove by a couple of times...totally not what I expected when I walked in...but can't judge a book by its cover!!!ordered the chicken sandwich and it was awesome!!!great grilled chicken with awesome fresh baked bread!!highly recommend! Will try a dessert next time as they look yummy!, 1
A great little breakfast place close to asu. Don't be intimidated by the shady exterior. Commit and get a good drunk recovery meal!, 1
My favorite breakfast spot. Coffee is good - they have flavored creamers if you are into that. Many flavors of jellies including Blackberry jam. Good portions for the price., 1
in a non descript school house at a Quaker Church compound that's it's so easy to miss it unless you know of the place. Parking's tight with both private lot and a neighborhood street available. Walking in, 1
Very good turkey burger and chili dog. Good prices. Interesting decor. Good service, 1
Chill spot for drinking with the boys. Not a place to bring your best girl to, 1

I first went to Mellow Mushroom where they started back home in Atlanta. I'm glad to say the pizza is just as good at this one, 1
Pretty good pho and rolls! I'm a Tram's girl, 1
I always stay at the palazzo no matter what, 1
The taste is fantastic!  I've been to Andrew's multiple times, 1
I may have to create a new list for places like Bistro La Bon...I think I may call it "Nom Fest" because I was in absolute heaven during their Sunday smorgasbord brunch.   Oh my goodness oh my goodness...whether you favor gratins or chocolate waffles, 1
Checked back in after a hiatus.  Had a special of the day pizza which included porcini mushrooms and buffala mozzeralla.  (no sauce).  FANTASTIC.  Looks like they spent some additional money upgrading the facilties too.  Good to see a local operator that cares enough to keep investing.   Will for sure recommend to others., 1
Think very yummy popsicles. They have many unique flavors that change regularly.  I tried the arroz con leche. It tasted like horchata. I liked it so much that i wanted to try another flavor. I got pecan. The pecan had a ton of pecans in it, 1
The reason I love Padre's is it's the perfect combo of casual, 1
Let me just preface this review by saying, 1
You just can't help loving Hanny's.  Great bar, 1
Everyone knows once you decide to like something and if asked "would u eat it again" and the answer is yes than you know this is the PLACE to come back too.   They got us start with the Bread with three different butters, 1
Very good customer service here.  THey have it figured out, 1
We love coming here for their Baked Pork Chop and Spicy Salt. We also usually get one of the fried rice dishes with our meal. The only knock on the place is the location. Never had a bad experience and we always look forward to coming here to eat., 1
Wesley and the girls at Paws Attraction are amazing--super friendly, 1
Most items on the menu contain pork or sausage. I had the Kung Pao Fried Chicken without the Chinese sausage. Came with confit potatoes, 1
We went there for a surprise birthday party and were about 20 people. It was a great night. The service was fast, 1
Now this is a pho place in the east valley I would recommend to anyone to try! The pho bowl ranges from small, 1
My favorite sushi place in all of Las Vegas.  It's a must eat for locals and for visitors., 1
Cool place.  My veggie burger was good.  The marinated the portabello and grilled it which is my favorite.  My girlfriends special pasta had lots of layers of flavor that exploded in my mouth.  The veggies were cooked just right.  My only complaint was that they ran out of lettuce at 2pm.  The salads looked amazing and I was so disappointed I couldn't try any of them.  Since I am on a special diet, 1
Never a disappointment here! I will admit I haven't gone for some of the more "gourmet" flavors like anything with cheese or other savory ingredients. However, 1
***For extra savings, 1
It's as, 1
I agree witih Emeline V. who reviewed before me.  I am also surprised this place isn't rated higher.  My sister feels the same way.  She's a Montreal native in that my sister first moved there from Vancouver in 1995.  My sister has also LOVED ice cream since she was about 5.  It only makes sense then that she LOVES Bilobquet.  Me and ice cream - it's complicated.  I'm very, 1
We had dinner here, 1
hello my name is kat and im a robertos addict. its all about the carnitas nachos!, 1
I hadn't been to Mark's since the remodel. It happens to be just outside of my normal breakfast route, 1
This was a great place to stop off for a quick bite to eat. The portion sizes were good and the prices reasonable. The ice cream was rich and creamy. Their fries are good and crunchy. I would eat here again., 1
Il Motore is dead, 1
Three cheers (or four stars) for Original ChopShop Co!  After several lunches brought into the office for me and now one actual visit where I dined in, 1
im gonna have to give it a five everything was perfect ambience wait staff food it was honestly impeccable from the moment we walked in till we left... and it should be cause we spent some cash ha.  Now me and the friend got two drinks to start with which i know the are known for their vodkas obviously she got the signature martini bad idea since shes never had a martini but it was drinkable for her and i thought it was ahhhmazing i got a vodka water with lime very smooth and everything you would expect from a good vodka cant remember the name soooorry.  We got the five course menu tasting starting with the caviar which i have never had i thought it was good not to fishy and a nice burst of flavor. second course was steak tartar which i also have never had but absolutely looooved i will definitely order again the presentation was beautiful with toast points nice and light not too crunchy... yum yum yum be careful with the anchovies though ha.  Then came the salad with a light dressing perfect. The intermezzo was a tiny shot glass with balls of sorbet and champagne poured over it i could have ate an entire bowl of just that!! next came my beef stroganoff now this is not your mothers beef stroganoff this is heaven in a bowl filet mignon slices peas baby pearl onions and fresh pasta with a darker sauce rather than cream sooooo good.  Then came desert which was our individual huuuuuuuuge creme brulees absoolutely ahhmazing....   Then we had to run  to see the Lion king another thing i would recommend, 1
Good healthy Mexican, 1
Better service with a drive thru !!! I just ordered the iced latte with butter pecan and a bagel Sandwhich. Their donuts are not that great ., 1
I come to Las Vegas for 4 days and got tired of eating American food. I wanna try hu tiu and pho.Walked inside and the place was packed. I went there Sat and Sun. Avoid going there on weekends! I order 3 hu tieu and 2 ice coffee. Cost about $38. It's right behind Treasure Island. I took a  taxi. I would definitely come back again. The restaurant is open 24 hours!, 1
Dear Linger Longer Lounge - I love the atmosphere & the concept. I have often frequented the Vig on 16th & Vig Fillmore where I am trusted as a repeat patron & fairly vigorous tipper.  Then you present me with a new concept - "Linger Longer"... "A neighborhood comfort zone where you always have a friend"... But there is a hitch - you don't trust me to pay my tab? Is Linger Longer a faceless club or a neighborhood comfort zone?  Please pick - faceless club or comfort zone... Comfort zones don't make you hand over credit cards (not run a credit card, 1
This teensy little Post Office does a roaring trade due to its super-central location, 1
This location of FastMed Urgent Care is brand new and one of the best urgent care experiences I have ever had. I had to go in this past Sunday for a recent injury and I had a very good experience from start to finish. I went in around 10:30 am Sunday morning. There was no one in the waiting room which was nice because I was hoping I would quickly be seen. I filled out the general paper work and that all went very quickly.  I was called back within ten minutes of filling out the paperwork. I was taken into a room and gave a brief description of my injury to the nurse. The doctor, 1
this place makes me feel like i am in Boston lol., 1
I am 'Vegas born & raised and have been eating here since the 60's. My parents ate here before me. My Mother in law has eaten lunch here every Saturday for as long as I can remember. She also has a margarita in her special mug. My wife and I join her once or twice a month. The chips and choice of salsa always get me ready for what ever I order. The food is not the Mexican food you would find in the spicy-hot places, 1
Have been here a few times and watched the management change... they finally got it right. Beautiful presentation, 1
I've been eating here since March 2013 until December 2013. This place is soooo good! Yummy food and they remember my name. :D  I've been eating at their place everyday. :)  Food is fresh. Salads are great. Service is awesome. Everyone I talk to, 1
To start of the new year, 1
Holy cow! This is NOT a "where's the beef?" burger! And, 1
Groupon is honored here, 1
What a great dinner spot! We had several apps including the tenderloin toast &  meatballs - both were excellent. I then had the Rokerij steak, 1
Charming little property. Of the weather is nice it's an awesome outdoor eatery.  Service is great, 1
Disclaimer ***I am a Beatles fan but not a "fanatic"*** ok that out of the way, 1
I come here when I have a group of friends, 1
I like Wazuzu!  We had a light dinner.  Ordered 2 different sushi rolls - they were wrapped with a white rice paper and not seaweed.  The rest of my party had the Beef Chow Fun with bean sprouts and the Pad Thai.  They were quite good.  It's also good for sharing as the dishes are quite big.    For dessert, 1
this place rules, 1
This place ws suggested to us by good ol' Jeff T for Elin's birthday. Although a good two miles off the strip, 1
Delicious. I've come here three times now, 1
It's damn hard for me to give five stars to a restaurant without any seating.  So I won't.  But I almost did it anyway.  We ordered a pate sandwich and a Le Pig Vert and retreated to Dino's for a beer.  The sandwiches arrived at Dino's after a short wait and they were outstanding.  The pate was a bit much, 1
I took the kids tonight for some dinner and they wanted to play with the arcade games. The waitress was so nice to them and even gave them extra tokens because she saw how polite and well behaved they were....it made their day! We will be back when ever they want to go!, 1
8/29/14.  I'm not a huge eater of chinese food, 1
I bowl there all the time as I live nearby and it has improved greatly recently.  In the past, 1
Just an echo.  Very fresh fish, 1
We stayed for 7 nights:  Pros: Great location: walking-distance to everything - transit, 1
Good burgers. Away from the strip and affordable but can't do 5 stars i had better, 1
Stayed here in March of 2011 with my parents.  Rooms and hotel are top notch, 1
On point!... I always start off with the "Al Pastor" (marinated pork) tacos. Then get chorizo and finish off with asada tacos. Don't forget to ask for their grilled onions n peppers. Also ask for a couple tostadas to scrape off d the meat that falls off the tacos. And to wash it all down a large  ice cold Jamaica. Everything is good from taste, 1
This is one of the most delicious and innovative food places I've been to.  Located in a community center, 1
The Mirage is a great hotel if you are looking for a nice hotel, 1
Just had a great night there, 1
Spectacular both day and night.   The Bellagio fountains go off every 30 minutes so you are bound to see them if you want to or not. It's really beautiful at night with the lights and the music in the background. It's also super romantic to go at night and watch it with your boyfriend or girlfriend =D, 1
What sends this local business aficionada back to a monster coffee chain again and again, 1
Live and love local! That's exactly what I got to do when I recently visited Paper Place. After an error with my Etsy order for engagement photos, 1
*This review is for the baguettes only  We stopped by here after Pho because my friend wanted me to try the baguettes. They didn't have any ready so they made them fresh for us. They were a dollar. I wish I could use more words to describe how ecstatic and happy I was once I had that gorgeous stick of bread in my hands. Warm, 1
Came here for their "Taste Montreal" table d'hote. The maitre d' was very friendly and accommodating because I had to change my reservation from 3 people to 2 people, 1
The Sopranos last supper was a great show. It was a very interactive experience filled with laughs and dancing. The performers were great and a few looked almost like the actors on the series. The only people who could really appreciate this show are fans of the series. Also some people might consider this offensive because like the series the F-Bomb is a very frequently used phrase. Some of the actions in the show are also colorful. So this is NOT a family show. For the soprano's fan, 1
Adam runs a great business with My PC Clinic! He truly cares about his customers and wants to ensure that they receive the best quality service. If you need your computer repaired - I definitely recommend My PC Clinic!, 1
You will love the pizza here, 1
After watching the fourth of July hotdog eating contest, 1
After getting screwed over by another U-Haul location just a few miles away, 1
I was in this area around lunch time and my colleague suggested we come here. I had never been to this place before, 1
This place was fantastic. We went for my cousins' 21st birthday on the 8th and had a table. The service was AMAZING, 1
It was Hockey Night in Canada, 1
OMG. We spent New Year's Eve here last and it was the best decision we have made for celebrating.  The place was great, 1
Went for an early dinner. Food was great. I even enjoyed their calamari - and I don't like seafood. I ordered the Filet - and it was cooked perfectly. The manager came over, 1
Comparing Simon's to sweet lil boutiques on St. Denis would be like comparing monkeys to seawolfs or apples to oranges. But when thinking of the world of department stores, 1
Came for dinner.   I really wanted to get crab legs on my trip to Vegas. The legs were really tiny, 1
Went for a late night dinner to see The Sea Merchants perform. Had never been here before and were amazed at how packed the place was! Service was cheerful and probably could have used a little more help - not sure they were expecting the crowd they got last night, 1
We went during happy hour.  Got the crazy, 1
Two days ago, 1
I love their food I get the fried chicken wings, 1
I always Yelp for new places when I travel and while visiting relatives in nearby Mesa I decided to try CHoP on a Sunday night. While the reviews all indicated the restaurant was usually not overcrowded we were surprised to find only 3 other tables occupied after 8! Needless to say the service was great and we had the pick of the tables! I would like to return when there is a bit more atmosphere - but it was a Sunday night. Then it may move up to five stars when I can rate the service under normal conditions.  We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the main course - Barbecue Baby Back Ribs with a baked potato substituted for the fries for my companion. The ribs were well seasoned - just the right amount of sweetness to let the flavor of the ribs dominate and not too sticky. And he never had to pick them up as the meat came completely off the hot bones with just a fork - Excellent. And that baked potato was a hit. It was perfectly baked, 1
I thought for some time before assigning a five-star rating to this one. And after my extensive contemplation, 1
So grateful for a fun place to eat when stuck in PHX on a layover!  I asked one of the helpful attendants walking around the airport where I should eat, 1
It's like going to the gyno: I want it FAST, 1
I love coming here when I am at NY NY or even in Vegas. This is a more fun version of TGI Fridays, 1
For those who are complaining: Who are you? You must be used to a more high-flying standard of living than I am, 1
"This is what Vegas is all about" my fiance uttered as we walked into the Lounge area at Mix.  My review is for the Mix Lounge only.  It was about 8PM on Sunday night.  It was Labor Day weekend so we expected somewhat of a crowd.  Based on past yelp reviews I was eager to make it to Mix Lounge and didn't care what I had to do to get there.  Luckily, 1
Devil dog (egg salad, 1
I really enjoyed my recent stay at Treasure Island.  While the hotel and rooms are nothing special, 1
Great lunch place. Foie Gras is to die for., 1
Best Korean food outside Korea.  I lived in the Cheolla provinces in Korea, 1
Great food and our waitress Tammi was wonderful, 1
Good parking. Although I am upset I had to pay $1 for my 30 minute parking. But that's Scottsdale for you. Nothing is always free. Even parking. Ilove all the shops here but they could update the map of the area because they are missing new places that have opened up., 1
Best deals on hats I've seen in a long time. I'll go again. The employees where attentive and respectful, 1
My favourite bagels in Montreal, 1
I love drive-thrus. I love when I can run an errand in my pajamas or in my sweaty gym clothes, 1
Chef Rusconi has done a great job with his restaurant.  The decor is nice, 1
Wow! What a great place! Picked Grapevine for the upper deck on a cool day. Get the lohvosh Cajun chic with onions!!!! Holy crap!, 1
Grabbed dinner their with some friends.  The food was VERY good, 1
I usually have go to Vegas for business/trade shows 2 or 3 times a year, 1
I like it. We go back again., 1
I was looking for a quick dinner before heading to bed and sushi sounded great.  I was solo so a nice seat at the bar, 1
Aboslutely LOVED the Zumanity show. It was a hilarious and exciting celebration of sexuality. I will go again the next time Im in Vegas., 1
11 Stars out of 10  Great Food, 1
I am from Spain and I am a foodie.   This place rocks.  Six stars out of five.  Better than sex (almost).  I would write details, 1
Food was tasty.  Atmosphere was a definite plus, 1
J'adore cette cha\u00eene, 1
Cet endroit est parfait ! Les glaces molles sont excellentes. C'est devenu un RDV pour nous, 1
Had a great experience at this store thanks to your amazing employee Sam. My friend and I renamed her marvelous Sam because she was so attentive to us and so informative and enthusiastic.  You are very lucky to have her as a Sephora rep as she makes you want to stay in the store and listen to her knowledge and her ideas. We LOVED Sam!, 1
Stopped here before attending a fight in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. This place has lower prices and is open more hours than most of the other celebrity chef places. I sat at the bar and had a beer and the crab cake appetizer. It included 4 small crab cakes which were awesome. I followed that with some sort of Pita, 1
We visited the bar area for dinner. It was full when we got there, 1
The food was delicious and tasted very fresh considering it was after lunch time, 1
We love the consistent, 1
My boyfriend and I will plan ahead and eat a cheap lunch just so we can splurge at Kumi that night. It is definitely some of the best sushi I've ever had. I wish it was a little less pricey--but its Vegas, 1
Great little restaurant...friendly service.  It's only been open 3 months now.  Good specials and portions....great Southern Italian flavor.  Lots of eggplant on the sandwich, 1
The All You Can Eat is so worth it... Lunch (11:30-4pm) For $19.99. Dinner (4pm-2am) for $22.95) .... All I gotta say is I usually come here once every trip I get out to Vegas :) good music and fresh food!, 1
I am a fan of this buffet.  It's been awhile, 1
Great ambiance and beer selection!   The Tuesday pizza special is also a bonus. We got to try every pizza on the menu and loved every one of them. Their cheese board was very lack luster. Seemed like someone went to the wal-mart down the road and chopped up cheap cheese like we wouldnt notice. Overall, 1
Ra boasts a fine happy hour.  The seaweed salad is fabulous and the rolls are sufficient.  Like the rest of the area, 1
Fantastic fresh food here! Never disappointed!  Two Brothers is a great place to go for breakfast or lunch, 1
Always great sandwich and salads. A bit pricey for kids meals. Quick ordering. Nice and clean. Service good, 1
Everything I have eaten here is delicious...a little pricey for lunch, 1
Such an awesome shop! I was excited a year ago to buy Baldwin and Imogene+Willie jeans because they were 100% made in the USA. Now Lawless Denim & Co comes to town and has me buying jeans that aren't just made in the U.S., 1
Benihana's @ the Hilton LV:  Saturday April 23, 1
Great fried rice and Mongolian beef! The only thing I didn't care for was the orange chicken it tasted weird., 1
Staff is very friendly.  Customer Service is great., 1
Amazing food. The pop tarts are pretty much the most delicious thing in existence. It's a weird week if I haven't come here at least once, 1
I had a apple pie and it was wonderful.  I ate it so quickly, 1
Pita Jungle, 1
I have been going here for about 8 months now and I couldn't be any happier at any other nail salon. Everyone working here is very experienced and they know what their doing. Every single time I get my nails done I get nothing but compliments from everyone. They are incredible and not too pricey! :), 1
Just move to FH and a lot of the locals told us about this place.  It did not disappoint either!  I had the fish taco's and my Wife had the taco salad.  Very good!  Cheap too!, 1
Absolutely loved the 50/50 platter. Everything about the meal was delicious even the two sides were perfect. Great meal for single guy for a Sunday night., 1
Went to the Sake taste and had a great time. Tasted incredible Sake and enjoyed so cool appetizers...loved the green beans.  The lounge area was super hip and the music was awesome...good DJ. Thank you Koi for hosting such a casual but cool event.  SAKE!!!, 1
Our waiter was super nice. I've been here a handful of times and this is the first that we've had such a good waiter. I ordered the lemon thyme dish-a bit salty. The old Ball and chain had the wings, 1
Always yummy!! a little pricey but its worth it and is reflected in the quality of the food and ambiance. Staff is nice, 1
More people should be flocking to this place. This is some of the best lunch and dinner food I have ever eaten and will always come back. Their deserts are delicious, 1
This is by far the badddessst club ive ever been to. Its damn near perfect. I took my girl for her  21  b day and it was going off on a monday. The outside has a massive pool for people to chill in or even gamble on. There is plenty room of outside that it doesnt get stuffy inside and lets you dance or just walk off and chill outisde. The cover is expensive for guys like 30, 1
Located inside the South Point Casino.  There was a line the last 3 times I've been here.  Must be the weekend, 1
Solid AYCE sushi. I met my brother here for lunch at 2 PM on a Saturday afternoon. We sat at the sushi bar with only two other people at the bar at the time. We got a continuous sushi feed and decent bicep workout of repetitions of chopstick to mouth. Free house Sake with Yelp check in. AYCE price includes soft drink.  42 pieces total of nigiri, 1
Best dentist I have ever gone too! They are very informative and really take care of you. I am not the biggest fan of the dentist but they definitely put you at ease. I absolutely love this place!, 1
Best pizza in Sun Prairie!, 1
Yeah!  Kickass Asian fast food!  No "bobo plates, 1
Solid 4 stars.  I usually judge Thai places on their noodle dishes and this place is GREAT.  Their spicy noodles were better than most and very spicy when I ordered it "2 spicy" out of 3.  Ingredients were fresh, 1
Amazing Chinese!  Gary did it again with this location and we love coming in to watch sports on a Saturday afternoon. Best Chinese in AZ!, 1
Was here for the feeding frenzy release of Altuzarra. Kari in the fitting room area was honest and helpful. Sent me home with good finds and buys not impulse buys and finds. My pieces look and feel great. No buyers remorse here, 1
Great place for a late night bite and no where else is open.   Fresh take on some traditional type dishes done burger style.   You can customize each one with a selection of diff toppings to make it all your own.  Pair your burger with the deep fried pickles.  The chili powder ranch dressing is superb., 1
They just celebrated their 1st year anniversary around July 4th. They have great food at an even better then average price. The staff has always been wonderful and the owners are there all the time making sure everything runs smoothly. Tuesday nights they have a special Taco & Tequila special for $20. The standard taco meal with 2 shots of tequila to sample or 4 half shots if you prefer. One of these Tuesday night I'm going to get there for that special!, 1
blame sleep deprivation or my strep throat or any number of factors that perhaps influenced my impression of this place, 1
I have been a Togos fan for many years and when they disappeared from the valley I was very disappointed.  So when I found they were opening around the corner from my house you could well image my delight.  When we first walked into the new one I was a little worried because I remember the decor of my previous visits to the old shops being much more lunch counter and this one was more like the run of the mill fast food style. I recalled one of my favorite sandwiches was a cucumber and avocado but did not snow it on the menu but when I asked they said I could order off menu.  The sandwich was good - a lot less ingredients than they used to serve but it was still delicious., 1
I've been coming here every time I visit Las Vegas. How many places have all you can eat lobster? The oysters are really good as well. The sushi is pretty standard as far as Asian buffets go. They serve boba here, 1
I don't eat at Marie Callender's. I used to work at one when I was in high school and I never really was a fan of their food back then up until now.   However, 1
I was watching a re-run of Bizzare Foods recenlty and saw Andrew Zimmern diggnig up clams in Rhode Island.  Suddenly I found myself with a strong craving for fried clam strips.  I used to share a basket with my mom at our favorite sea food place when I was a kid.  I had to have them again.  It had been too long.  After much searching a failed attempt at a restaurant that no longer exists, 1
Amazing pizza! Meatballs are fresh and truly homemade. Price is a little high from other business around  but the pizza won't disappoint you., 1
If your car is worth less than $3-4k, 1
The main reason I visit Zipps is the wings. Best wings in town. Also, 1
It is really hard to believe that I have yet to write a review of The Lost Leaf. The Lost leaf used to be the place to be. I guess it still is. I love it anyway. Just not on a first Friday. Too many people on that night. I like it on a  Monday when Jiggle or Running from Bears might be playing a little something. Free jazz and there is no cover also.   You wont find any fruity cocktail or smokey concoctions at this bar. Strictly beer and wine. I think they even have a few taps now. Love the craft selection. They have something for every beer drinker in phoenix. The wine selection is the tits as well.   They don't serve food though so you should plan on eating before or after or not at all. There are a few good places around the way. And the bar tenders are super appreciative if you bring them tacos... hahaha. I like ending up here as we stroll through downtown Phoenix. Its not too casual but not too... stuffy (?) I guess. I can't find a word for it. But Its different. Its one of those places where you can make new friends and always run into a few old ones! Tells you who my fiends are... :D   These bar tenders are my favorite though. Not to mention I found my love of craft beers 5/6 years ago at this very bar. So, 1
I've come here a couple times now...I don't love it or hate it...but there are certainly some very bright spots!    The gringo in me feels like i'm deep inside a different culture just by walking in here.  Also, 1
I love how you can request and "build" your own drink without feeling like a bother. There is a nondairy section but you can also ask to have any other drink to be nondairy as well. I ALWAYS get a nondairy coffee milk tea, 1
Take a Seattle style coffee house, 1
Overpriced yes, 1
I have died and gone to sushi heaven!  The irony is I happened to eat sushi earlier today at a different restaurant, 1
A friend went to Q's for lunch yesterday and raved about it, 1
So my good friend, 1
Didnt expect a nice restaurant to be in a location like that.  When we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly staff. The atmosphere kinda reminded me of a nice italian places where a mafia family might have a meeting in the corner table while listening to some amazing live jazz music. (did that make sense?)  The appetizer/entree were both great and the owner/manager even stopped by to say hello and chatted with us for a bit to make sure we were enjoying our dinner.  We were too full to try the dessert so maybe we'll get a chance to try it out next time. All in all, 1
My wife and i really enjoy the friendly staff of this shop and the massive selection of hookahs and shisha flavors....if you smoke hookah or just wanna see a cool shop in north las vegas id stop by and say hi =), 1
They backed up my old computer for about half of what I thought I was going to pay. They were professional and friendly. Can't ask for more!, 1
Stayed here with my hubby for two nights (of four) when in Montreal for my cousin's wedding.  As soon as we walked into the room, 1
I agree, 1
We came here to see for ourselves, 1
This is hands down our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  We live all the way across town yet making the 35 mile drive (one way) is totally worth it.    The service is outstanding and everyone is really friendly.  Our favorite person though is Bobby.  Bobby used to be our server at another area restaurant and we were pleased as punch when we ran into him one day here.  It's kind of like visiting a friend when you go there!    My only problem is I can never decide if I should get the short rib tacos or the ribeye steak tacos.  Start off with their sangria that I could go swimming in or the shaken lemondae then finished by the red velvet cake and you can't go wrong.  Love this place and I'll be back.  Often., 1
Visited Midori for dinner.  Fish was excellent! Salmon was melt in your mouth fresh.  They have a very interesting selection of rolls that sets them apart from other sushi restaurants.  There were rolls for sushi lovers, 1
overall- Great! Delicious barbecue and tofu! The thing is that Korean people ( or people who have a great deal of experience in Korean food/ BBQ ) would probably not like this place very much. This place has different types of food, 1
Server was good and there wasn't much a food selection as compared to a cheaper station casino buffet but it was tasty and the cinnamon French toast was to die for!!! About 35 per person for brunch and 40 for dinner. I will eat here again.....eventually., 1
I travel extensively and Yelp is my savior. I followed the reviews and they were correct about Wally's. The food is above average and the service is great. I visited Wally's twice in one day...lunch and dinner (UPDATE - 3 times in 2 days NEW UPDATE - 4 times in 3 days).  If you're a guest at the Hyatt, 1
I really enjoy watching the planes come in and out in this nice cafe spot. Food is decent and service is always prompt., 1
Ted's has the best hotdogs in the state-hands down.  I am from Chicago and have eaten many Chicago style dogs and I just like Ted's better.   I like my hot dogs on the grill-  I like the all beef and the footlong-beef and pork- the best.  The cheese fires are fantastic  I've read some of the other posts -its obvious some people have not gone to too many hot dog stands lately and seen the prices.  TED"S IS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE.    You go to some other places in Phoenix and you're spending around 8 or 9 dollars for a hotdog, 1
Food is great.  Service has always been fantastic., 1
I am addicted to this place. I take everyone I know there. Friends that I have taken there are now going and taking their friends and I love that!  The best part is the service- no the food- no the service- AHHH! You get the point. I love the manager Chris, 1
I thought it was good for $25... Lots of choice and good quality. Desserts were good which not often the case in buffets. Good option for a late breakfast., 1
Love their food.  Generous servings and best flan I have tasted in years.  Basically a drive through and the employees do not speak much English, 1
I came here very early morning at around 10am so I didn't run into any busy traffic with waiters, 1
After 17 million spend this is the #1 buffet in Las Vegas for now  for kitchen cleanliness, 1
We love The Buffet at Wynn. We ate here twice on vacation. Lunch and dinner and we were impressed AS USUAL. Always a big selection of tasty foods. The deserts are exquisite. The Buffet at Wynn is my go - to even when I don't stay at the Wynn. The only buffet that is comparable at the time is at Aria., 1
This is a nice quick water show to watch as your walking by the strip...I've seen it many times..my favorite was when they sequenced the fountains to the song from Titanic by Celine Dion...if I had a boyfriend, 1
Wow!! The coconut shrimp is the best I've ever had. Be sure to use Tiger Sauce on the delicious fish tacos. This place is unique & worth the price for the quality of food! I work & live near here & I will definitely be a regular here. I can't wait to try the chowder!, 1
Living near Groceria Italiana is like having my Italian family nearby.  Easy access to excellent food.  Homemade pasta, 1
Went here on a Saturday night and it turned out to be a seriously good club. We got there slightly after 10:30PM and the bouncers were holding up the line as usual. Wasn't in the mood to wait, 1
i ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and i was surprised with the portion. It was huge and so yummy. I love how they put tofu and chicken in my dish. Normally you have to pay extra for that since the dish always comes with one type of protein. I wish most restaurant in San Diego, 1
This is easily one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. You can get a delicious steak experience without having to pay super premium steakhouse prices.  I love the filet with the red wine reduction. My brother loves the filet with bernaise. My parents love the french onion soup. The fish was just okay, 1
(Jetta is, 1
I cannot believe it took me this long to finally go check out Radio Milano.  It may have taken awhile to get there for my first visit, 1
I wanted to end 2012 on a high note. In reality I ended 2012 on a high summit.    My original plan was to spend my ultimate hike of 2012 climbing up Frenchman Mountain. As the weekdays turned into the weekend, 1
This huge mall has various shops and restaurants. Upscale, 1
Based on our recent visits, 1
Perhaps one of my favorite brunch spots on the planet. The place is small weith only 4 tables and a bar. It is also dark and can get pretty loud, 1
It is inexpensive, 1
Lantz was our DJ and he did a great job at our wedding reception! He kept the party going and followed our schedule even as we changed it around during the course of the night. My only concern up until the wedding was that I hadn't met my DJ in person since I lived far away, 1
On short noticed I needed a place to throw a business happy hour.  They gave me the entire private back room with a separate entrance and exit and our own server.  No hassle, 1
Great service. I failed to tell the owner I lived on the 3rd floor of an apartment but he still gave me the fair price of $70. Be sure to acknowledge that if this is the case for you that when setting up your appointment and getting your quote. My puppy destroyed my nice white carpet with urine and poop and after proficient clean was done there was no evidence the little monster made a mark anywhere in my house. It was fast, 1
It was a week before my wedding and I needed my hair colored and highlighted. I showed Sarah a few pictures and she knew exactly what she was doing! I couldn't be happier. I will never get my hair done by anyone else!, 1
Excellent Chicago dog, 1
Great deal for locals buy one get one free with club card., 1
What a little gem this restaurant is, 1
Awesome pasta with excellent environment :) chill and relaxing.. Good place to stop by!, 1
All I can say is wow! I had a huge problem after loaning my car out to a family member. There was fast food everywhere mashed in the carpets and smeared all over the interior. Jay not only cleaned it to perfection, 1
You can't go wrong shopping at FoodWise.  The owners, 1
I'll have to come back for a proper meal, 1
No one is lying when they say the outdoor area is incredible... because it is! If you entered through the back, 1
This place is going to take off!! I just stopped by and the owner hooked us up with a sampler dinner for the family and it was fantastic. The ribs were the meatiest I have had and literally falling off the bone.  The side were ALL unique and a great use of different flavors. The Rib Cage is definitely a step up on taste and quality.  I am really hoping to see this new restaurant be a permanent fixture in our neighborhood., 1
Yum. I love burgers like I love my men and this one was HOT, 1
this dirty little dinner has great service, 1
Was a very cute little place. Very artsy!! Good coffee. Awesome cake!!!! Not too sweet and full of flavor. Will be back., 1
What a fun place!  On top of the Playboy Club at the Palms which makes a pretty cool experience.  Great music, 1
Had the Fish and Chips. The Fish was fresh tasting, 1
Nice spot off the beaten path. Wife and I had antipasto salad and split a pizza with sauce, 1
best damn tacos in las vegas hands down!  go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 1
This place is Fantastic! It has a good vibe, 1
We stopped in for their lunch buffet while visiting my sister who lives in Vegas. Great food, 1
What's great about this place is that you get good food pretty quickly if you don't have a lot of time. It has a casual feel but the food is more of what you'd getting in a 'nicer' setting. I had the chicken shawarma, 1
Pros: Good sushi for being so far from the ocean.  Very polite and friendly staff.    Cons: Loud people at the bar that thought they owned the place.  All in all, 1
Uncle Joe's pizza has just become my favorite place to get a New York Style of pizza (AKA Thin Crust) in LV.   LOCATED in downtown LV in the newer portion of Fremont Street past the light show experience and across Insert Coins.    Their PIZZA has all the quality's of a thin crust that I love. First, 1
Love their appetizers!  It is a little too pricey to visit more than once a month though., 1
Decided to grab some coffee and while yes it's overpriced like ALL Vegas coffee it was actually really good. I ordered a couple of Hammerheads for the wife and I and I noticed they were making crepes. Based on a conversation I overheard the Nutella and Banana should be one crepe so I ordered both to mix with the wife. They were really good too. Sure the price is a bit much but you expect that when you are here.  Definitely will come back again before we leave., 1
All I have to say is STICKY BUNS! I went to the El Chorro Lodge for the first time last Sunday for brunch. Outstanding! Great service, 1
This place is a full-scale exploration of sensory overload and deprivation. Seriously, 1
It's a mini-mart gas station. The staff is always polite, 1
I love these guys!! The food is great and the people running it are awesome!! Good folks and good Food!!, 1
I feel pretty good about Lux. I put much of my teeny server's salary into this place every month, 1
Delicious. An adorable Mom and Pop shop that dishes up great food at affordable prices. What really impressed me, 1
I had a salad and it was only around $4.  I'm big into value and let me tell you I took half of it home.  It wasn't the best salad that I've ever had but I wasn't disappointed.  I would return just for the pricing and portions!, 1
This location offers plenty of Parking located in a major parking lot. The servers greeted upon entering the door. After never visiting before the server seated us and took the time to advise on local favorites and specials. After the food was ordered which consists of burgers and breakfast options, 1
Ri-Ra's is an Irish Pub and Restaurant that becomes a popular nightlife spot in Uptown Charlotte after dinner hours.  The food is good for the price level, 1
I CANNOT resist a bakery.... I had to stop in here my 2nd day staying at the M Resort.  The prices are reasonable. I had to get my hubby something from here since I was staying at the hotel for work. In the mornings, 1
Ya this place is great, 1
I was introduced to this bar by an old landlord in arcadia. at the time i was not a buffalo wings kinda guy but that has all changed. this place has set the bar for wings in phx for me. fried, 1
Love their flavored crust pizza...not my all time favorite Pizza, 1
Love the food! Best meat kabobs I've had.the rice is to die for ! The hummus is yum! So well worth it .., 1
Love this place! I was just there the other day and it puts a big smile on my face! I loaded up on my Christmas gifts there. The boxed chocolates are so pretty, 1

This place looks awful Food is greasy and makes me feel heavy.  So why the decent rating? the food you do get tastes awesome. Price did go up this year, 1
What does the "B" in @Mresort Studio B buffet stand for?  Hmm how about...  B for bountiful! Studio B buffet has so much selection! They have all kinds of food- like Italian (pizzas, 1
Wow this is good breakfast food! I am so impressed with the food scene in Phoenix, 1
Love love love! Delicious! I have always been a fan of Chef Gordon Ramsey. I was so looking forward to eating here. It really is worth it to treat yourself to his brilliant menu.   Our waiter and his assistant waiter was amazing. Yes, 1
One of the best experience I've had with a waiter at Olive Garden. She was quick and always around. On this visit I had the shrimp primavera and the zuppa. The shrimp primavera is one of their healthy options but was a little on the bland side.  The service was what won me over and if I'm inclined to go to any Olive Garden, 1
I've been here a few times in the last 5 years or so, 1
Retro Bakery should be enjoyed by everyone that loves sweets.  They have a fabulous variety of flavors that includes vegan options.  My favorite was the vegan peanut butter cup.    I purchased a dozen random flavors and asked my co-workers to do a taste test for me.  The flavors that were appreciated the most were Maple Bacon, 1
I have been going to Studio 924 for a couple years now. Everyone is friendly. The cuts and colors I have gotten have been perfect. I have been to several salons in Madison and this one is the best for customer service, 1
Love America's.  I won't drag on about how awesome they are, 1
Honey Pig is a decent place for Korean food. You can trust me when I say that because...well I am Korean. Ok I'll be honest, 1
Tried Thai Rama in Chandler for the 1st time.( Chandler Blvd/ Dobson.) The place is small, 1
One of the last great bakeries in Phoenix....in Arizona for that matter.  No one compares to the Jewish bakery that has been operating in the valley for over 30 years.  Although the original owners are no longer running the operation, 1
You will NOT leave this place hungry!  I'm a Food Network fan, 1
Marrakech is an excellent venue if you're looking for a set price, 1
My wife and I cannot speak for everyone at Sienna Animal Hospital. We can, 1
TAO always delivers a fun night when my friends and I are in town.  If you are staying at The Venetian, 1
Bomb Burritos & fast, 1
if you want a great Italian dining experience it doesn't get any better than this! the prices are awesome, 1
What a great place.  So friendly!  The wings are awesome.  I love the cheese pizza!  We will be back!, 1
me and a bunch of friends met there for Sunday brunch. we have the boarding pass cards so it was discounted. i believe it came to like 10 bucks. the place was spot on clean. the waiter was right on with more Mimosa's. the food was great. and we spent maybe 15 min in line. maybe. i would highly recommend this to anyone. the other thing i love is that it is only a 10 min drive from my place. i have gone to the theaters there and a few of the other restaurants. i am still impressed with the stained glass above the table games., 1
Ok another long over due review. I have only two mani pedi before I enter La Bliss. I will this was the best one I ever had. Carolyn was awesome. Her shop is great. She great music playing. She always have a great selection of wine and beer to choose from to aid in the relation. I love that it's 1 on 1 attention with out feel of being hurried. Carolyn is funny and professional and her shop is immaculate. Please make sure you do your hands and feet a favor and go to La Bliss, 1
After choosing this place after it's great reviews, 1
The first thing that sticks out in my mind was the service.  Our waitress was all smiles and incredibly adorable!   Edamame was perfectly steamed  Sushi was tasty  Salmon Teriyaki was delicious  sake and kirin washed it all down  prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is calming., 1
All I can say is 'food coma' and its 100% positive! Wasn't sure what to expect when I walked up to the restaurant's door but believe me the food is amazing. Serving size is larger than most for the price range so order the half sandwich if you are new to the place and go up from there. Will be returning in the future., 1
Best place to stay in Vegas I have stayed at Wynn encore Caesars bellagio you cannot beat the signature towers. We have been coming to Vegas for 15 years again this is the best., 1
OK wanted to give a horrible review that bashed the service and Scottsdale in general.   Yes the food is great... and overpriced a bit for the portions.  OK the service isn't bad just they have that Scottsdale arrogance I'm guessing they could use better hours and better pay.  Had some great little event get together here in the past and am thank full for it., 1
Way more fun than I had intended! Red Avenger report to duty!  Aliens and Sigourney Weaver, 1
Well I ended up here kind of my accident. It was a rugby weekend. My parents were coming to visit for the first time. But I left it way too late to book somewhere for Saturday night food! After calling what seemed like pretty much every place I could think of without any luck I resorted to TopTable to see where had availability. I spotted Pink Olive as I'd heard a few people mention it before, 1
I have been to a few nail salons and found a fair, 1
Very fun and cool bar downtown, 1
great atmosphere here @ shalimar.  a few months back i was there to help 2galsevents with a charity golf tourney.  it was the "par it in pink" event.  and it went really smoothly.  i drove around and helped take some pictures of the event to post.  i also helped with the set up pre-dawn that morning.  all in all this was a casual golf course right in Tempe and we had a great time that day., 1
My husband and I have been to several Indian restaurants in Vegas, 1
There's so many extensive reviews already I don't need to write another, 1
We sat at the bar to grab a quick lunch bite. Our bartender was very friendly and had great suggestions. Lobster mac n cheese is awesome. The bucket of buffalo wings were a hit or miss, 1
RiRa is a chain. I've been to the one in Evansville, 1
They had good shredded beef tacos and great enchilada sauce.  Much like Jessica, 1
Just in from San Diego staying at a hotel near by. Yelped for places to eat close by and found this one which read it was on Diners Drive In's and Dives..I'm a big fan of the show so I considered myself lucky to find one just down the street.  Walked in and the women at the cash register was quick to help me with the menu being I never been there. I asked what's the most popular and she said ..everything. .but if you like spicy. .then you can try the bombero burrito. So I ordered the bombero burrito with Carne asada. The Carne Asada melts in your mouth and the diced raw jalape\u00f1os in the burrito was a nice touch too. Beans and rice were great. However, 1
This is THE place to be if you can afford it...and you can.  It is a Wyndham property so you know it is good.  They have two pools, 1
It's not often one can find a GENUINE Italian Market & Deli.  Enzos is definitely that.  At last a great place to find a variety of house-made sausages (without additives like corn syrup) that taste fantastic.  House-made Italian bread on the weekends and too many prpared dinner entrees to write about.  We especially like the Italian sausage pinwheels with spices and parsley.  They are all terrific however. This small little place tucked next door to a huge Asian market just off Old Monroe Rd. is a real find.  Enzo is a real talent., 1
Their meat is really flavored good here, 1
Doesn't everyone look for a place where people knows your name? La Scala happens to be this kind of place. The employees here are warm and hospitable. Sometimes after working a 10-16 hour shift, 1
This is one of our go to sushi places because it's close to our house, 1
I'm not a huge music buff and have never played a musical instrument in my life.  That said, 1
Dr. Liu and his staff make going to the dentist easy and stress free. I've never had much of an "issue" with visiting the dentist; however I am new to Arizona and had to find all new doctors. I knew from my first visit that I wasn't going to have to find another dentist. After my first cleaning, 1
I frequent this little pizza pub a lot since its in the neighborhood. They have one of the best selection of beers I've found. Being an ex-saucer girl in the past (flying saucer) I love a good beer and miss having that option now that I live no where close to the Saucer here in Charlotte.   The pizza is decent not the best in town but its tasty, 1
What can I say? I'm hooked!  I've always driven right past Rita's on my way to Target. I had always been curious but hadn't stepped foot inside. I had been craving frozen yogurt but there aren't any close places around. So I admit it, 1
Very clean tanning salon.  They keep the towels in the back so don't forget to grab one before you start your session.  Friendly employees and great stand-up beds....never a wait., 1
Went back when my parents flew into town and wanted to check it out.  After reading some reviews on their Fried Chicken I had to give it a try and I am glad I did.  The meat was moist and the skin was crispy and tasty.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that goes up to Cave "tourist trap" Creek.  Enjoy!, 1
Excellent food and great that they can accommodate large parties the fries are so good you have to eat them all., 1

This SNY seems smaller than most to me, 1
I visited this restaurant April 16th while on business in Las Vegas.  There were 3 of us. The food was so inexpensive we just ordered whatever we felt like. I am happy to say the food was also wonderfully delicious. 3 people, 1
This is the new style of cafes in Las Vegas, 1
We always have a good breakfast here and we go on a regular basis.    We saw a story on The Original Pancake House on the Food Network and apparently the staff arrive at the establishment very early to start making food from scratch (pancake batter, 1
I took my sweetie out to dinner on Valentine's Day (making reservations a month in advance).  Service throughout the night was prompt and attentive, 1
I recently brought a relatives car here after we replaced the fuel pump and other things on the car and I have to say it was a great experience! I arrived at 7:30 when they opened and they had all of the work done within an hour and the managers were very friendly., 1
The food was great but the service was a bit uncoordinated.  I had dinner at 9 pm here in a party of five. The wine selection is extensive and the setting is modern. There is a large cheese bar that you walk from the bar to the dining room If you're a cheese fan, 1
I stayed at The Orange Tree several this summer. I love this hotel because it is an all suite property with full kitchens and very spacious rooms. Both the bedroom and living areas come with flat screen tvs, 1
This is a nice business oriented hotel located near the main strip. There's no gambling going on here, 1
Being an out of towner the dining choices in Vegas is overwhelming, 1
The best Mexican food I've ever had...period.  Salsas and queso make it an over the top experience.  A must have if you live in or around Charlotte., 1
Regardless of what people say about location, 1
I work here so I may be a little bias but this is the one place I feel will make Arizona a better place.  The ideas, 1
Just had my Audi cleaned here. In SoCal this was easily a $50 wash and clean. The amount of detail these guys went to in cleaning this car was phenomenal. SoCal car washes need to come and watch these guys work. All this for $25. I am so impressed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you., 1
awesome service.  VERY knowledgeable!  Fast service.  Mark goes above and beyond for his customers.  Will use again!, 1
I came to a baby shower hosted at the henry over the weekend. The place was easy to find and there was ample parking. The space reserved for us was private and the decor was absolutely charming. There were small food offerings which were all pretty decent, 1
This is the best spa I've found since I moved here in December.  I am very picky and the girls remembered me and what I like and what I don't like. They made me feel very comfortable and welcome.  They are sweet, 1
My kids and husband love the swimming pool.  It was uniquely build around this massive salt water aquarium with sharks and lots of big fish.  There was even a water slide that goes thru the the fish tank.. my 7 year old daughter loved it.  We would definitely go there again for the pool..  PLus for a weekday rate of $49/day it was a great bargain., 1
If you read my reviews you will see I rarely give 5 stars, 1
This is a great family style restaurant!  The food is extremely tasty and is set in a relaxed atmosphere. I definitely recommend you stop here while in Vegas ., 1
Happened upon this place by accident and what a pleasant surprise!  Started with the saganaki which was the only disappointment of the meal.  It was sliced way too thin and it wasn't coated enough so it wouldn't stick to the bottom of the serving dish.  My husband and I order the meat lovers special which included a little bit of everything, 1
The reviews on this company are SO mixed, 1
Fun place, 1
The restaurant is quaint and appealing.  Our waitress, 1
What really blows me away about this place is that the food is amazing!  Great karaoke with modern Asian and American songs.  Everyone will be happy here, 1
The Milkshake Factory is within walking distance of my workplace, 1
I had a water leak inside a wall. I called Brothers Plumbing in an emergency to get the water stopped. It turned out the water leak was in a fitting right at the concrete floor inside the wall and very hard to get to. Kevin came out and analyzed the problem and determined a way to fix it with minimal damage to the surrounding area. Kevin was very knowledgable and explained all my options regarding the repair prior to doing the work. I appreciated his technical ability., 1
The flavors here are truly great, 1
Placed a $160 to go order and EVERYTHING was correct and nicely packaged. Food was very tastey. Everyone was happy with their lunch., 1
I love this place!! I live down the street so I'm there at least once every couple of weeks, 1
Classroom Central is an awesome organization helping students in underprivileged schools get school supplies they desperately need. Every employee and volunteer at Classroom Central is really passionate about what they do. Risa G., 1
I received a 30-minute gift card to this place for Christmas. I've only ever had one foot massage before, 1
4.5 stars   After months of trying to plan a time to come I finally made it. Did I love if? Yep! I love that its a big space with plenty of seating although I did get mine to go.   What'd I walk out with? Tiramisu cup, 1
I went here with three friends and we got a table outside in their beautiful courtyard with overhead fans and greenery all around. We walked right in, 1
This place has amazing deals! They have happy hour daily from 3-5 pm AND again from 8-10pm! The lunch specials here are from 11-2pm. I love the #5 sushi roll bento. It comes with soup, 1
If you are looking for the urban feel and wonderfull pizza look no further! Cibos setting couldnt be any better, 1
I had no intention of actually going to this place, 1
Best burgers ever! Their specialty burgers are amazing! A different burger and milk shake/malt every week!, 1
Wonderful place for a staycation (or any *cation for that matter). Service from the moment you enter the resort is five stars (yes, 1
Wow I would highly recommend this place.  My friends and I started with the cinnamon strawberry biscuits and I never would've thought cinnamon and strawberry went together but they were amazing.  I then moved on to the pancakes. I can't tell you how amazing these pancakes are. They were so thick yet fluffy and they had a crunchy outside just like at home, 1
Food tastes so much better when its free!  I ordered the curry lobster roll and the bone-in filet mignon with three dipping sauces. Being somewhat of a grilled meat snob, 1
I've reviewed my current dentist but I never forget Todays Dental! I had to stray due to the fact that Todays Dental isn't able to do a payment plan for the amount of work I have needed (needing my 8th root canal currently) At my new dentist I have spent over 3.5k on dental work...paid in full as of today :)  Back to Todays Dental and the best dentist, 1
I wasn't crazy about the Untouchable since I don't like Primanti's sandwiches, 1
I had been wanting to try this place for years, 1
Absolutely amazing!!!  Have been looking for a taco shop like this for some time since I moved to the PHX area.  I must say - I finally hit the jackpot.  Cabeza, 1
Great neighborhood casual restaurant.   Don't let that description fool you as the food is excellent. Way beyond your typical pub and grille expectations. My mother and I both ordered the Bourbon Street Pasta consisting of penne, 1
I am far from expert in this field of  sushi but I've tried a fair amount at a fair number of places, 1
Purchased their service through Groupon.   They were punctual arriving during their 4-hour window.  EXCELLENT Service. Great carpet cleaning. Have tried half-dozen other companies and Sweettouch is BY FAR the best.  I will buy another Groupon as I want our carpets cleaned only by Sweettouch., 1
I would recommend Pruitt's Plumbing without hesitation! They are contracted with my home service warranty company, 1
Went out for Sunday breakfast. I had The Country Benedict. Poached eggs on a biscuit with a sausage patty and fried red potatoes. It was delicious. My friend had the pumpkin pancakes.  Hers was also delicious. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and courteous. Definitely going back again., 1
I found this place on yelp during my stay in Vegas. My boyfriend and I were trying to kill time since our flight came in wayyy earlier than our hotel check in, 1
We always come here for delicious chinese food when visiting Vegas.  char sui and fried tofu dishes were the best. Family style food portions were plentiful. Service was good and fast. Facility and restroom were clean at lunch time., 1
This is a no frills hotel, 1
I learned about Spatini from AZ Spa Girls and loved the $20 gel special. Jeannie told me that is ongoing with $5 for polish removal. Such a good deal. She didn't even charge extra for the French gel manicure.   I was thrilled to have the option to book online and was able to make an appointment for the same day. Jeannie did a great job on my nails, 1
Like most of the restaurants in NYNY, 1
Healthy eating made easy!  Quick, 1
Good Thai Food. Spicy levels, 1
Went again to this place last night for a little happy hour with my networking group. We reserved the semi-private back room for our group that would easily hold about 25-30. They had a few food items on happy hour $4 special; potato skins, 1
I can see this place becoming one of my new favourites when I'm up in Edinburgh.   I stumbled across it completely by accident when out with friends & we were all glad I did.   The decor is absolutely mindblowingly flamboyant, 1
I couldn't be more happy about our stay at this hotel. My friend and I drove overnight (11 hour trip) from San Francisco for spring training. We pulled in to town at 8 am and obviously we were exhausted. We went to the hotel not only did they let us check in at 8 am (regular check in 3 pm) they gave us a complimentary breakfast.   The rooms were clean, 1
Great atmosphere and even better food. Order bruschetta (obviously) and make sure you get at least one prosciutto and fig in your flight! The Italian Picnic salad is amazing- goat cheese... bacon... I mean what more could you want?! The only downside is you're almost forced to use valet parking. Pretty annoying but hey, 1
When I moved to the US, 1
Thank you to the amazing staff aka Tj (a goddess) dan (sweetheart) and Steve (nicest guy ever) and Adam for the the hook up :) smaller club but the best time I ever had in Vegas :)))), 1
We had a company office dinner here and had a great experience.  The service was outstanding and food was very delicious. However, 1
Second time eating here. The Amigo Roll and Scallop Roll are the best so far. It hasnt been busy either time Ive been here for lunch. The house special rolls are 20% off right now too!, 1
We came back for retakes and Kenny and Matt were very helpful and did a wonderful job., 1
Mac n cheese burger and the onion rings were huge and delicious. Our waitress was awesome too., 1
We stayed here for the first time this past weekend.  I was very happy with the hotel - the one bedroom suite was very spacious and clean, 1
Hung over from your hardcore partying at (fill-in-the-club-name-here)??  A nice, 1
I cannot even begin to express how much I enjoyed Rose. Rabbit. Lie.!  I've been to Vegas many times, 1
GREAT PLACE TO LIVE!  I just renewed my lease for many reasons. The place is nice gated community and quiet at night. Any maintaince issues gets resolved quickly. The office staff are fantastic! And like anywhere in NV we see some bugs, 1
My fiance bought a mountain bike from Mcghie's and has since brought it back here for regular tune-ups. I went with him on his last trip before he ended up selling the bike to a friend. We thought we were moving to Alaska, 1
Love this place!  The inside is just so cute, 1
The quality of ice cream at Antney's is fantastic. Truly some of the best stuff I've ever had! They make it in house, 1
I've taken my laundry to the Laundry Factory a couple of times now.  They are always prompt and do a good job at taking care with your clothes.  The place is surprisingly clean and bright for a laundromat.  As Zoe mentioned the prices are very reasonable and you won't find a cleaner place anywhere near Shadyside.  Another plus, 1
You have to try the spicy pork taco. So many great flavors. Savory pork, 1
This is my mom's favorite place to eat.  The breakfast food is delic!  The salads are good portion and come with a muffin.    We were there for lunch on a Sunday two weeks ago.  We had family from out of town, 1
I've been to Nero's three times. The four-star rating reflects an combined average of each visit.  The first time I went to Nero's was in 2006, 1
I didn't really eat at this place, 1
A downtown gem! When you work downtown and you're limited with choices in healthy decisions to find a place like Grass Roots is a blessing.  Small but quant and helpful staff. Wishing this place a long lasting stay in downtown Vegas. My holy alkaline is amazing and my co-workers watermelon mint with super berry boost in both were a juicing persons dream., 1
Okay they are under new ownership. The gas is the same price as sams club, 1
The ambiance is the best part. Expect to pay about $30 for breakfast for 2 (with juices). If they had some combo's with drinks and breakfast deals that would make me come back., 1
Called to find out if they sold salmon sushi and they said they would be getting some in, 1
In recent trips (probably five or so) the food and service have been far above and beyond the expections my first visit had led me to have. It's a fun laid back restaurant and bar with good food and drinks, 1
We love mojo!  Its not as evil of a treat and the flavors are so yummy! A minor downfall is how the mix-ins are sometimes hard to reach and I've seen a girl literally put her whole head into the bar and that grossed me out with the idea others have done the same... Aka- possible human debris and hair in my yogurt!, 1
Brad was here today and my window are clean and sparkly!   He is honest, 1
If you're considering Wolfgang Puck in MGM, 1
Came in for hangover brunch. Was not disappointed (queasy and headache-y, 1
These people are experts in their field.  Experts.    You want quality, 1
Went to PIR for the second to last Nascar race of the season in November.  What a fan friendly race track!  The layout for RV camping was great and easy to navigate to find your spot. The showers were FREE (and clean), 1
I used to make fun of this place as a teenager but secretly buy everything here. I'm pretty sure everyone did that in high school, 1
If you are looking for an authentic British pub you found it. Sausage rolls amazing, 1
pretty good food. very attentive waitress. only issue was i ordered 2 spice. she somehow heard 6 spice.. was a bit much for me. but food was fine for everyone else in my party, 1
Absolutely delicious!! Fast, 1
I love cbtl ice tea., 1
Found KJ kitchen with  fellow Yelp member's review. It was our first time there and overall the food was simply outstanding! We ordered Pork Belly, 1
Fourth night of honeymoon, 1
This is a MUST DO for anyone visiting Vegas.  It's so much fun, 1
So I just came back from NY and Philly and I can honestly say that umm...while Luigis gets honorable mention for effort, 1
The lobby was hot, 1
Taxi Champlain appears to be the company with the most cars around Montreal.  There was almost always a Champlain car at my hotel and if you needed to call for one, 1
My Cousin just got married here a few weeks ago and the entire evening was amazing!!  The indoor and outdoor settings were gorgeous, 1
Definitely worth the money you pay for. And you get one mimosa/champagne/bloody mary included? Nice. What I loved about this buffet is the variety. Many different stations with food that you normally wouldn't find (not just your regular mashed potatoes and roast beef kind of place). I also loved the presentation of each dish- some in little pots, 1
Had I good experience with this Alamo location. I often rent here from their sister's company "National" and the experience there is seamless has I have been an "Emerald Club" members for two decades. My historical experience with Alamo in large airport was generally waiting an hour in lines... however, 1
I love this place! I got the vegan veggie scramble as well as a veggie scramble with egg whites on separate occasions. Lunchtime gets quite busy. Otherwise, 1
What a cool place.  Less then 10 minutes from downtown.   We did the 7:30 tour, 1
As always great coffee with great service.  Especially at 7 am.  Pumpkin Spice Latte was good, 1
I'm so happy I met Jamie!! Did an amazing  look for my photoshoot, 1
Went for first time today. It won't be the last. My wife had the brisket tacos and I had the brisket burrito. They say they smoke their own and they do a really good job - super tender and smoky. Service was great. Seems a little more geared towards adults (OK with me). Very nice bar area., 1
Today was my first visit to Blynk, 1
Great place to get a fast healthy lunch.  Their salad bar is amazing with so many options.  I love the custom option that lets you add whatever you want for a set price (with the exception of some premium items like the meats and shrimp that cost extra).  I really like how they will chop the salad for you to your desired size and add in your desired amount of salad dressing so you can get it exactly the way you want it.  I found the medium level salad dressing to be slightly heavy so I'll probably go for light in the future. They also have some breakfast sandwiches (probably not quite so healthy).  There is a soda fountain machine offering an interesting selection of natural sodas.  The line can get pretty long during peak weekday hours but it moves quickly, 1
I can't say enough good things about Dan! He got me in on short notice and got my 2013 Elantra looking sharp in no time. You can tell that he takes great pride in his work.. The rates are extremely reasonable! I would easily recommend him to anybody. I fact, 1
Have used this service for almost 2 years.  Started using when the E Bell Rd Car Wash went belly up - and haven't used anyone else since starting with Pit Stop.   They always do a top notch job, 1
This place just happens to be my happy place! I go walking in it every other day to unwind and just get out of the city. Forewarning, 1
Had a wonderful breakfast here.  I really enjoyed their way of doing potatoes and of course the biscuits are light and tasty!, 1
I always get the Kung Pao Chicken. Which is absolutely delicious. The service is good too. My only issue is like most casino restaurants its overpriced, 1
Had lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The Service is fast, 1
I had garage door damaged in the middle of the night. This guy was the only one that cared enough to come out in the middle of the night... I cant say thanks enough Jeff.... Your the best!!!! highly recommend...plus this guy really knows what he is talking about., 1
I saw this place on American Restoration TV Show and put it on my must visit list. I have been a huge fan of pinball all of my life. We stopped in and had a blast. Seeing some of the games that I played as a kid gave me a warm feeling inside. My wife had a equally great time and we stayed for a nice long time. We tried at least 40 different machines. We just shared the most of the machines, 1
My family and I have gotten our routine oil changes, 1
After being a little day drunk from a Marquee pool party, 1
Despite the hustle & bustle of a prime student location, 1
Our large team of developers and testers had a class there last week. Our cooking ability was mixed, 1
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE GOULASH! get it, 1
We waited in line to get in after the Coldplay concert, 1
I had lunch here other day because since my son in law hates Italian food I don't get it very often. I decided to eat as much Italian as I could on vacation.  I got the Caesar salad which was good and a huge portion  for a little side salad.  For my entree ordered Chicken Francese. It was very good. The sauce was perfect with a lemony undertone and creamy tomato taste on top!  Service was great and manager came over to introduce himself and check on me.  I would definitely go again., 1
Just had lunch with two teenagers and everyone loved their food.  Double bacon burger was a huge hit especially the yummy bun.  Another had wings...buffalo style.  And I of course had my usual pulled pork tacos which were fresh and had great textures.  We all had the Mac and cheese.....fantastic way to warm up on a cold afternoon!, 1
This one is as close as the local food in hawaii. Food are great, 1
I have been using them for a few years now, 1
Strawberry lemonade and pretzel sticks with marinara sauce, 1
I've been coming here for years and haven't had any consistent problems.  Out of a few hundred sticks, 1
Get the chicken fried chicken on top of a waffle and then topped with eggs (your way) and a side of chorizo gravy....NOW! The bf and I will be living closer to this place soon and that could be dangerous. Mariah was a great server, 1
Themed after an old fashioned ice cream parlor, 1
Happy Hour night. They close at 2am. I always enjoy my dining here. Service still good this late. Nigori kinda of pricey.  Sushi guys are fun to watch as they work hard to prepare the dishes. Always a variety of fresh fish. Free Korean pancake small portion pupu., 1
Unique (well, 1
NV Cleaners continues to be my go-to for dry cleaning and alterations because of the consistent quality of care and customer service. The drive-thru service is such a plus and just so convenient!  I've had jeans and work pants altered and patched here and they've always done a great job. Price-wise, 1
Delicious! Fast seating and service. Had the skinny margarita and the Mexican pizza with cheese and guacamole and my sucky day at the airport got better! The restaurant is nice and modern the only thing I would recommend is for the music the be less loud., 1
Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay LV: Strip Saturday April 24, 1
Really good coffee and service. The daily bakes goods are excellent. Make sure to try their flat white latte!, 1
I totally love this little place!!! The family that owns this place are friendly. The service I've received have always been excellent. The food has never failed me. I love their Panang and Eggplant...I find it really difficult to avoid ordering the same thing, 1
This is an incredible, 1
What a great experience!  To begin, 1
FEZ is now on my "forever favorite" list of midtown establishments. With their awesomely late hours of full dinner service, 1
I realize there is not much variation in SAQ stores, 1
The bar and wait staff couldn't be better at this location of PF Chang's.  The food and service is better than any other 'Chang's' country-wide.  We just moved here from NY and missed our "local hangout".  The bar tenders and wait staff have made us feel at home.  We go at least once per week for wonder food, 1
Please move over! Can you imagine a group of gals walking up and down the strip looking for some grub that didn't require too long of a wait. Well believe it because my friends and I were starving upon entering. The place was pack, 1
Second time here and I still haven't tried the burgers. They looked pretty decent coming out, 1
Rocco's sure looks like a NYC pizza joint.  Partial brick fa\u00e7ade, 1
Service was very good & the food was great, 1
Went to another place before and wasn't happy with the experience or the price. Referred by a friend and won't go anywhere else....love this place and all the perks they offer! Go to Diana, 1
Fantastic happy hour!! The staff is super friendly, 1
The food is amazing here. The service is fantastic. The staff is always cheerful and ready to help you.   If you are there during the week be sure to check out the music of Joe and Dawn! The best part is they take requests.  Worth the trip up there for sure!, 1
What a great addition to Uptown Charlotte. Very nice to have some green space in an urban environment.   I am questioning some of the security issues that may come throughout the night, 1
What a simple breakfast menu and yet the food taste nowhere near simple! There was just something about the food that made it one of the best breakfasts I have ever had!!, 1
Called from out of town, 1
As far as airport food goes, 1
This restaurant is delightfully enchanting. It doesn't look like much from outside, 1
Delicious pizza... ask for the white pizza with ricotta and tomatoes (the italian sunrise) Super cheap late night spot or after a day of bad gambling! The guy Niko is a character. Will def. be stopping back here next time!, 1
This place saved the day recently when we needed really, 1
This place has a been favorite of mine since my ASU days and it doesn't get as good as having to travel to the Middle East for Shawarma, 1
Very busy night at this restaurant so we sat outside. Only one waitress for the whole patio and service was slow but when the huge platter of food arrived we quickly forgave the wait., 1
Best delivery pizza that I have eaten!  The menu offers some different variations than the usual choices available. Last time the crust wasn't as good as the previous occasions and btw, 1
Krissy did an AMAZING job on my balayage... This was my first time gett'n my hair professionally done & I'm very satisfied. She took her time & made sure I was comfortable. I didn't realize how long I was in the chair bcuz we talked thee entire time! I would highly recommend her to everyone!!!, 1
Good brand and company- I've been a fan since a friend introduced me. She was so passionate about their great service and products that she now works there! Sadly she isn't at this location, 1
I have visited here twice and both times I had the chicken Parmesan.  This place serves the best chicken Parmesan that I have ever eaten.  You can tell they use fresh ingredients. My husband had the Salmon, 1
Great new spot on the second floor of the freshly opened College Avenue Commons. Vantage point from the patio offers great views and a modern, 1
I flew in one afternoon to have dinner with my lawyer and stay for a few days on business. I arrived early and hung around in the lobby of the restaurant. Nice entrance downstairs. Casual, 1
Well... Came out with a giant smile. First timer and definitely coming back. Beware you might not want to bring your nicest clothes, 1
I love this place.  good food.  cheap beer.  great local people.  the bartenders are never stingy on the alcohol either!, 1
I've never stayed at Bally's but my first experience was a good one. The self park has you entering the Paris which is right next door and you can enter without going outside. Check in had us waiting about 30 min but since my husband and I were there with another couple, 1
Liberty Tech and Tire saved my life and my road trip. Rashid took such good care of me and he was incredibly friendly. He is the owner and he was there working on a Sunday. Would highly recommend to anyone living in the area and anyone driving through with car trouble. This place is honest and really does care. Thanks Rashid!!!, 1
I've been to Wet Willie's in Miami a few times and always had a good time and decided to give the one in Charlotte a try.  The crowd in Miami was usually pretty hype. I went with a group of friends after leaving the Comedy Zone.  The crowd was nothing like the one in Miami but that was fine with me.  Nowadays I have to mentally prepare myself for the hypeness.  Definitely don't like being unexpectedly hot and sweaty when I go out.    Our server was very friendly and asked us right out the gate if we wanted to sample any drinks before we ordered.  Of course my friends and I said "Yes!"  I tried the "Margarita, 1
A must eat place in vegas, 1
My wife and I come to Las Vegas twice or three times a year and always grab a cocktail or two at Maggiano's.  i am really glad to see that the owner realized to re-implement the best happy hour on the Las Vegas strip. For some reason they decided to stop this in May. But given the state of the economy, 1
Gotta love that drive-through service. Close to home and they are pretty fast in responding to your needs. Zip in and zip out, 1
this is the place I go to get real mexican food but tweaked the way I like it. They always make what I want even though it isnt on the menu. It's a carne asada quesadilla with diced green chilies and extra cheese. Oh yea... I've tried a bunch of almost identical mexican food shops like this one in the valley but this one stands out because they remember who I am and were really ok with me asking for something different and maybe strange even without speaking spanish., 1
I had a groupon to this place so a few friends and decided to check it out.  This place is tucked away in a little courtyard building near some dance studios..great ambiance on the patio and quaint dining area inside.  Service was spot on. First I ordered their house made white Sangria.. Was refreshing and delicious.   I decided to get their signature dish after eyeing some of the other customers getting it. Was a HUGE Panko breaded pasilla pepper stuffed with mahi mahi, 1
This Town Square location is an above average place. I waiver between 3 and 4 stars, 1
Just happen to be in the area so decided since I have been to the one in Chandler it should be good. I was very surprised. First the place looked so much cleaner and more professional. The cooks were dressed all in uniforms. The amount of sushi rotating were all my favorite. I ended up eating way more then I usually can. Exceptionally clean place and well organized team. Was seated quickly and water, 1
Stoners or not, 1
Very large and clean mall. Good high-end shops. Generally an upscale crowd. Superior to Newport Fashion Island in Newport Beach, 1
Very authentic Greek food and ambience. The owner came and chatted with us for a while., 1
If they had 4.5 stars, 1
Love love....love Azteca. Their made to order Guac is the best.       I've eaten here quite a few times throughout the years and have yet to be disappointed. Their Carne Asada is delectable as well as the Arroz con Pollo.      I highly recommend the margaritas too! Azteca is great for large groups because of it's lively atmosphere., 1
Extra double yum.  The cucumber jalepeno margarita is outstanding.  My food was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to go back.  Service was fantastic and the place has great ambiance., 1
My wife and I have been looking for a good quality, 1
Absolutely delicious! Went and had the mussels w/ frites as an appetizer. I don't usually even like mussels, 1
Everyone here is a caring professional. I have never had such painless novocaine injections.   The dentists, 1
This place is amazing. We had a party of 11, 1
A very good fast food !! The burgers are very good (the best I've eaten), 1
I come to Trader Joe's for just a few things, 1
Yeah um this place rocks. Cool bar area. The bomb, 1
The other reviews are pretty much dead-on: good food, 1
Stopped here to try Saturday Brunch.  The cornbread/apple butter they give you as a start is sooooo good!  I couldnt get enough of it.  I had the Cali Benny, 1
I've had better Gelato... but this was from a vendor in the side of a building in Vienna.  I've yet to have anything that measures any higher than the gelato that the spot churns out in the Phoenix area.  They have a great selection of flavors, 1
We first came to Living Spaces two days after they opened, 1
I booked had a 2-4-1 coupon and decided to try the buffet at the T.I. It had good food and I got so full by my second plate. There was cotton candy! the only con is that there are long lines for some food items. We enjoyed the Asian food sections and the Italian sections, 1
Always friendly and great service.  It is nice to get whatever you want on the menu anytime during the day or night.  The pies are really good., 1
Today was my birthday and my wifevtook me to this Long Wongs. Long Wongs has always been a favorite place for me to eat. My love for long wongs started as a kid. I would get excited when I knew I was going to get some of their wings. This excitement continues even to this day.  Their is just something about their wings. The sauce is great and instead of baking the wings, 1
This is by far the best place to shop for those old records that you're looking for. I own my parents' old vinyl player at my place, 1
Great hotel and service.  I love that there's no casino or smoking. Quiet and clean.  Had room service breakfast... Huevos rancheros were very good, 1
It's been almost 3 years since I first visited The Cupcakery and I still think they have the best cupcakes EVER (and the prettiest).  So far, 1
I've been here twice, 1
I'm a big fan of this place! I've had the chance to eat dinner here as well as eat off-menu light bites when organizations I'm a member of have booked lunch here. I've also had the chance to enjoy a quick tour of their wine stocks, 1
Keturah never disappoints!!! I've been going to her once a month for about a year now and I always leave very satisfied. The quality of her haircuts are awesome and I couldn't be happier with what she does for me. Last time I asked for a two block and after she was done I seriously felt like a korean pop star and I mean that in a really good way..lol. Anyway aside from the two block I've asked her for a lot of different styles and she always knows what to do. Also, 1
Perfect ! This is a "must" stop on any visit to Montreal.   The room is simple and elegant, 1
i ate hear on 10-26-14 around 6:00 pm.  even though i made reservations i still sat in the bar.  the restaurant decor was nice and i was the only one in the bar eating.  the service at the bar was just okay.  they were not very helpful or overly nice.  i would give the service 4 stars.  i'm sure i would have received better service if i sat in the dining area.  the food was good.  the bread basket was good.  my caesar salad was different but just okay.  my bone-in ribeye was a 4 star ribeye but the fries were great!!  in my opinion i would go to delmonico steakhouse in the venetian which is a few steps away.  my dinner before tip was $101., 1
OHMYGOSH. So delicious! Glad we found the Max Brenner in Vegas...was hungry for lunch, 1
You must eat here for dessert! This place is a wonderland for those with a sweet tooth! Their dessert menu probably contains anything you can think of - milkshakes, 1
After walking the strip for hours, 1
I've been flying in and out of this airport for more years than I care to think about, 1
This is my favorite place to get thai and I have not found a place to rival it.  Now it's not perfect.  I got on a regular basis (they know me when I walk in now... I go that much).  The service is either great or slow, 1
I have always enjoyed this foot spa even when it was under previous management. The new owner had a month of may incentive for a $20 hour massage which was worth getting back for!  This last most recent visit I had the greatest massage performed by Ping and she is wonderful in everything she does!  She is heavy handed which is great in a massage however I am a bit sensitive so I asked that she lighten up a bit with the tight grips. (lol)  Everyone is different so you just let them know how hard or soft you would like your massage and they will accommodate.   I am still Amazed at all of the work she provided me in one hour for $20 bucks, 1
Since having moved into the NEW & IMPROVED Holgas on 3rd St. & Garfield, 1
holy omfg you dont even understand i had the ebi salad which was really embarassing bc i didnt know if it was pronounced like "E-B" or "eh-B" you dig? but it was freaking magical like you know when you eat magic beans you just want to die youre so happy? thats how i was omg the shrimp was like perfectly spicy to the point i was like whoo but then the salad noodle thing was like perfectly crunchy idk im not a real critique i just love food anyways the waiter dude was cool slightly creepy but yolo um it was a little expensive like $32 i think idk i didnt pay but we got the Teeter Tots, 1
Great food at relatively cheap prices. Their steak hoagie is great! I can't tell you about anything else because that is all I get!, 1
Who knew this place was so popular? From the outside, 1
My schedule at work was changed for the weekend, 1
Had a terrific Breakfast Sunday morning with my niece from Los Angles. Great Breakfast Burrito, 1
En Fuego is quickly becoming my go to cigar spot on the strip. Minutes from the strip but without the strip prices.  Their Humidor is Packed to the gills with some very hard to find sticks, 1
I am not gonna lie this place is way awesome. I was totally surprised when m wife and I discovered it. We love chipotle and Cafe Rio but this place's salads beat any of those! Plus they dont charge extra for every little thing, 1
I found this place while looking for a Birthday Event for my partner. He loves unique and original places like this and indie films. This place was perfect.   We went to see all the 2013 Oscar Action Shorts. We don't drink, 1
This place is a staple when I'm in Pittsburgh. Fantastic happy hour menu, 1
I've recently become a huge pho fan, 1
This place is THE BEST for rentals. Usually great availability on new stuff (abused the Blu-Ray selection, 1
I love all the staff here. They really care about you and your dog. I will continue to bring my dog and future dogs here for every problem they have. My czech german shepherd is very protective of us and they take precaution with him and take him to the back room to prevent any of that. My dog a couple months ago was at the vet for some minor limping, 1
My date and I started in the basement which was super cozy. While waiting, 1
It's an AMAZING PLACE!!! Recommend it, 1
I always have the best time when I go to Firefly!  They have amazing food and perfect Sangria's!  I would definitely recommend their bacon wrapped dates - cannot even explain to you how amazing they are!  I would also recommend their steak and mushroom kabob - I do not even like mushrooms and I order this every time I go there - because it is that good!  The only complaint is that it is always crowded and I hate waiting for a table. At least you can sit outside if you would like, 1
Perfect place for a business trip. The staff is very polite and helpful, 1
I went to this establishment on one the TapOut promotional events. The food and drinks were moderately priced and the portions were plentiful. The service was pleasant and attentive but it was a Thursday night. The happy hour beer and sliders promotion needs a couple more additions. Good place for cold beer after hiking at red rock., 1
Disclaimer: A client of ours, 1
Found this salon on instagram & decided to make an appointment. Mayra was my stylist and she did a great ombre on my hair blended perfectly w no brassiness at all. I showed her pictures of what I was looking for and she gave me exactly what I wanted.   Clean environment + friendly staff.   This was the first time I left a salon satisfied! After countless horror stories at numerous salons, 1
I had some "down time" in Vegas, 1
I think Target is doing a great job at being um, 1
I called from the East Coast; I had looked online for a courier in Las Vegas who could get a certified copy of a government document that same day and FedEx it to me that afternoon.        On faith, 1
Nothing but wonderful things to say about the Holiday Inn Express in Verona.  Like alot of others who stay here, 1
Best fried calamari in Mtl!!! That's it, 1
You think that a meth habit is hard to beat? Then don't try this place's pho sate or its curry stew (best with French bread, 1
I absolutely love their pizza and drive out of my way to get it, 1
Joe's is the perfect place to go on a hot summer day.  When we walked in, 1
Got the Ahi & Hamachi poppers, 1
It's looking like I'll be staying here once a year for the rest of my hopefuly long life. I have found the environment in the Venezia tower - for me - to be totally conducive to a complete brain defragmentation in a very short period of time. They also have one of the only pools I've ever enjoyed hanging out in. Each afternoon I relaxed by the pool reading. The water itself was a tolerable temperature and the jacuzzi was never too crowded.   My only complaint about this place is the horrific, 1
Absolutely gorgeous and worth your time. I'm not a "nature person" or a "hiker, 1
DELICIOUS!!!  The ambiance is wonderful and it overlooks Bellagio's water show which happens every 15 minutes or so.  For starters we had the foie gras (hot) and it was perfect. I had the duck and it was amazing. My husband got the steak and he said it was one of the best steaks he's ever had. That is a bold statement coming from a steak lover who eats a lot of steak! We ended the night with a chocolate  souffle which was a perfect end to a perfect meal.  I've been to many fine dining restaurants in the city, 1
Spectacular. Beautiful. Extravagant.   I think the Trop has finally landed itself a worthy venue. Opening night bash was fantastic last night and the facility is stunning. I can't wait to try the food and for warmer weather to bask in the daybeds.  The setup and design are elegantly pristine and very chic. I can't wait to go back; I hope the food is fantastic., 1
I love this place !!!! It's dark and fun with great food.   If you want great Italian food with an amazing dining experience this is the place to try. I went with a small group and had a blast!, 1
I've only been here once but I had a great time, 1
I'm not much of a sushi lover, 1
A nice stop for lunch, 1
Saw Garth Brooks in concert last night. LOVED him!!!  I've been a Garth fan for years, 1
After my 1st visit, 1
Who would have thought a Philly Cheese Steak on a pita would be great. Try it and see. Chicken Souvlaki sandwich is great. Good to know a great place for lunch., 1
So many great choices in one place. Not to mention, 1
I love this store. I always feel like a queen when I shop here. Today, 1
Cheba Hut had a vision from an Amsterdam trip and is growing the dream to legally sell Chronic, 1
GREAT selection of bottled beer. Not that many drafts to choose from, 1
This vet's office and staff are more professional than most of the human doctors I have encountered. I would never take my cats anywhere else., 1
Such a fun experience! I'm warning you in advance, 1
Easy to miss, 1
Simply put its our favorite movie theater in Charlotte.  The food and drink have always been great and never had any issues with rude patrons.  Its also nice if you want to get dinner somewhere else in uptown then walk to the theater., 1
I can't speak for real estate services, 1
Awesome chocolate shakes!!!, 1
Gooooood foood! Great atmosphere good for group get togethers or even a date :) and also excellent service, 1
Your standard Target, 1
This is a good place to watch some NFL on Sunday.  The food is creative and never disappointing.  You have to try the Wisconsin Cheese Curds if it's your first time.  The beer list is a lot of Stone Brewery and analogs.  I usually get the Woodchuck Cider draft.  I can't believe how much better Cider Ale taste on tap compared to the bottle, 1
Stopped in for a beer and some wings before the game. My bud ordered the pizza and wing special. Really good pizza! Watch out for the fresh jalape\u00f1os!! Definitely try the "beesting" wings!!! My Ass is on fire!, 1
Much of old town is the same, 1
Best tacos in Vegas!! Nuff said!!!, 1
I've read the reviews, 1
I eat here a lot. It's a good value for the price. Then sandwhiches are better then subway and way cheaper! Love them., 1
Just had my gate to backyard replaced after twenty years.  Sean, 1
We came on a Friday around 2 pm. The line to check in was incredibly long, 1
Love the ginger salad dressing. Food is always nice and hot. Service is very friendly. I love that they have a drive thru for those post yard work dinners (you know, 1
I made reservations on Open Table for two at Mon Ami Gabi after reading all of the raving reviews here on yelp. We drove into Vegas on a Friday night and parked in the Paris Paris parking lot. After spending the next few minutes trying to figure out how to get to the restaurant from the casino, 1
the earl club is so good! a warm turkey sandwich with lettuce, 1
We are regulars and have tried several things on their menu!  I have yet to have anything that I don't like.  Also if you are a fan of brewry beer...good place to go.  The atmosphere is upbeat and the service has always been fast and friendly!  Great place for lunch/dinner or happy hour.  We have taken several friends and family here when they come to visit and no complaints!!!, 1
Now this here was a good recommendation and a pleasant surprise.  This location is literally a hole in the wall (or a small hallway through a wall).  You have a tiny path to walk between tables squished up against the wall and the bar.  Behind the bar is where the employees are cramped between the ovens and the cooking area/bar making stuff up for the customers and tripping over one another trying to maneuver around in that tiny space.  Now...don't be distressed.  It was actually a good experience.  I stopped in after work by myself, 1
The BEST pizza in Las Vegas, 1
So you may feel like a cattle in line to get branded as you shuffle through the gated line on your approach to the bar, 1

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Laris and his staff.   I use Dr. Laris mainly for cosmetic work .  He is so kind, 1
I really like this casino.  I was informed it is the only one in Vegas that has a completely, 1
If you want to get someplace on time and you want me to find it you need to allow for some getting lost time.  GPS was invented for guys like me and I don't happen to own one.  In addition to finding this place I had been asked to find another place as well for future reference.  So after 3 trips around Scottsdale Mall (which really needs one of those map thingies) I found the first place and off I went on foot for Bacon.  Using Google I had picked out exactly where the building should be and walked right past it and by the time I crossed the bridge I was getting worried.  So I went a ways down 5th and still didn't see it so I headed back the way I came knowing I had a couple of other options for breakfast.  The sign over the door is much easier to spot heading south.  Bacon shares an address with Devils Martini and in fact may be dual usage of the same space.  I know there were Devils Martini placards on the tables.  If they do share the same space it would explain why it looks more like a bar/lounge inside than a coffee shop.  In any event I walked past it the first time without looking close because the building and parking signs I saw first said Devils Martini.  I didn't think to ask the question so maybe somebody will fill this West Valley person in with the answer.  In any event the easiest way to find it is to look for Vidal Sasoon and Bacon is across the street.  I was greeted quickly walking in the door and I took a high top with a view out the window.  The person who seated me got my orange juice and soon Tori, 1
This was my first visit here. Met my sister and brother in law for dinner.  We were greeted right away when we walked in. Given our choice of seats. It was a little busy. Our server came over to get our drink orders. We received the drinks quite quickly, 1
This Goodwill location is BY FAR my favorite location, 1
If you don't come here you're stupid and probably don't deserve the great service and delicious food., 1
There is nothing outstanding from this Starbucks that differentiates it from another great Starbucks. Drive-Thru is speedy, 1
It's easy to rate this chic downtown salon 5 stars. It's very clean and the welcoming staff are very warm and accommodating.  Guys: if you need an extra sharp haircut for a special occasion or if you're someone who always likes to stay sharp, 1
I've only gone with Pistachio because it's my favorite flavor, 1
By some cruel coincidence, 1
Tao never fails to deliver.  They always have greattt music when we go.  The dance floor is pretty small so that kind of sucks.  And the foam thing is cool at first but can get old when they keep doing it throughout the night.  Otherwise, 1
Can't say enough about how awesome this shop is - they'll take great care of you, 1
Sweet pork is really good.  Red sauce is great.  Chips and queso are fav as well.  Location is always busy., 1
The food is good & the service is always great! Never had a bad breakfast here, 1
I am so happy I have found another great place for good food in Las Vegas! Whoever said that there aren't good places to eat in Vegas are highly mistaken!   The location is a little off, 1
Every time I'm in Vegas (at least twice a year) I make sure to see "Love." It's not as acrobatic or breathtaking as some of the other Cirque shows, 1
My extended family lives outside of Pittsburgh.  Before a visit in 2006, 1
This place is located inside of the Belk store, 1
Awesome little joint with high quality beverages - I had an unsweetened iced tea recommended by [who I think is] the owner, 1
I've been coming here for years! The sushi is the best I've ever had and their entrees are also very good. The service is so friendly as well. You can either dine up at the sushi bar, 1
Absolute magic.   The Fireside Lounge transforms a person. Sitting there drinking Jack Daniels while eating plate after plate of ribs served by beautiful women in long evening/nightgowns all the while surrounded by fire and water and live concert videos, 1
Yay for local business! I'm always craving Italian food and the chains around here are not impressive. I have a new favorite.  For my first visit I stuck with a standard, 1
This company was so professional from the moment I called for estimate to final installation. They called prior to appointment time to let us know they were on their way. On time for installation appointment. Very satisfied with finish product., 1
Love this gym everybody makes you feel so welcome. And no one judges you on how fit you are or not. Highly recommend, 1
Great burgers at a good price... Cool atmosphere and very good beer. The service was really good too!, 1
The sales people on the floor are a tid bit pushy they assume because your looking eather you need to buy or leave. Everyone was nice so I can assume they were ready to go home after a long day. I wont return. I went down the street and got a full bedroom set so its their lost. Next time maybe they wont rush they clients., 1
DP Dough is a lifesaver.  They have a big selection of calzones, 1
Diverse crowd and affordable brews. If you like drinking beer, 1
Wow! I finally decided to stray away from THE STRIP and take a short drive to what I heard got voted "The Best Yogurt in Las Vegas" by the Las Vegas Weekly. When I got to there, 1
Outside being A bar, 1
I went here today as usual. busy busy busy. I was walking round the centre nearly everyone was smiling. Most shops in which I recieved good service. One place in pericular within here was a chemist called boots. I was looking for something and got directed to the right place. When I got to the chechout the cashier was very social with customer service and ready with a smile. I rate this 5/5 because I go to this place a lot as it's quite local to me and the service usually all in all is very good., 1
Between Tim Schumacher and Danny Walters I was able to climb a steep learning curve, 1
Been going here for almost a decade.  Never had any problems.  Very affordable, 1
Such a cute place!! I was there for breakfast, 1
HAD craZy fun!! Went to XS this past weekend and it was great!  The line was freakin long- but worth the wait!  Inside was beautiful & a great mix of house & hip hop (wish it was ONLY house/Trance!)      and wow- there were so many beautiful gals everywhere... enjoy, 1
Motor City is located in a strip mall off Paradise. You'll miss it if you're not looking for it, 1
A favorite of mine. Bahamarita martini is a must and signature drink. It's refreshing with their coconut shrimp pasta. Customer service is always friendly., 1
My wife brought me home this turtle item with nuts and it was totally delicious. The taste was definitely much better than other options that are out there. My wife commented on how much she and our daughter enjoyed their items (bear claw and a circus fun cup cake )., 1
We love Golden Harvest! HUGE delicious portions make busy nights easy. Friendly staff. We've been coming for years and will continue., 1
Sometimes it is fun to take the furry friend out and about, 1
This is my go-to starbucks for "getting work done". The staff always has a smile, 1
This place is fantastic.  Not only do they keep you in the loop with all of the steps of getting a vehicle wrapped, 1
What else can I say that hasn't been said in all of the positive posts here? Great, 1
I'm from Pennsylvania and this was my first trip to Montreal.  I went in February for Valentine's Day and my hubby's b-day so I got a great deal - buy two nights, 1
Monday night and I was already downtown for this Inside the Trenches thing and I was hungry.  My friend suggested Ticoz and it was perfecto, 1
First time here..definitely will come back. The service, 1
After an exciting and activity filled day at the lake this summer my lower back was tweaked more than usual.  I've always had tension in my lower back but this was very persistent and even my regular massaging wasn't helping.  Dr. Stang started out with a conservative acupuncture session with a handful of needles.  She was up front in saying that it may take a few sessions and an increase in the number of needles before it really kicked in and she was spot on.  After the first and second sessions I'd have temporary relief but it would come back that afternoon.  After the third session however, 1
This was the right decision when it comes to brick oven pizza in Arizona. The wait was only 30 minutes and the pizza was so much better than the well known and televised local competition (let's just call them pizza B). The ambiance was fantastic and it was the perfect date spot for the wife and I to sit back and relax. They even had a local musician playing live music to even better the mood for dinner. Service was fantastic and every part of our dinner made the wife and I happy about our dinner choice.  Let me start by saying everything I ordered was perfect.  The ostra salad was plenty as a starter for the wife and I and it was fresh with fantastic tasting ingredients. The diavola spicy pizza with ricotta added was the best pizza I have ever had. My wife's white pizza was fantastic as well it had mushrooms greens and pork I believe on it The banana creepes with Nutella and ice cream was oh so yummy. The fresh made iced tea was also unique and fantastic.  We left with a 3 course meal for around $60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received  I would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone., 1
Ahh my U-Swirl. This has to be my favorite fro yo joint in all of Vegas. Yes, 1
Went here over the weekend. Heard great things about it from some locals. We did the Karaoke bar. My girls Nicole and Kelly sang some amazing songs. The DJ Travis was fantastic. If you love to sing ( which I don't sing) but if you love to and want a nice dive bar that is family owned and friendly, 1
It's this simple: the BEST Korean food in town!!! :D  We always eat tofu soup here and they're the best in town (we tried others), 1
Great place for breakfast.  Waffles are wonderful (ask for well-done!) and fantastic Chicken Fried Steak.  Everything is fresh as can be - and the quality of their meats is fantastic.  Anything you order with beef will be really, 1
Del Frisco's what a great place to eat. My Wife and I went on a trip to Vegas in January. So we made reservations to eat at Del Frisco's while we were there. Because a friend of ours told us it was a must to eat at Del Frisco's when you are in Vegas. Our big night was Tuesday Jan. 26, 1
Best coffee shop in Madison by far!  Always impressed with the locally roasted coffee selections and the tasty seasonal drinks.  Ancora has drinks for the coffee snobs and the "Grande Iced Caramel Machiatto" folks;)  Stop in, 1
Awesome Tawnya you rock THE place in Vegas to enjoy old school Tiki drinks Great vibe   Cheers, 1
I have stayed at many hotels in the US and abroad.   The Westin  Phoenix is 5 star from the beginning. The hotel is centrally located downtown in the heart of the city.    From the cozy modern rooms to the fabulous outside patio that serves dinner until midnight.   If you are an SPG member the hotel has a fabulous club floor lounge that serves drinks and snacks all night and breakfast in the morning., 1
Nightclub!!! Went during the night Kaskade was there and it was packed!!! Literally our bodies were touching the person next to us. Definitely claustrophobic status. You could not make your way throughout the club without being pushed around.   This club had an upstairs and a downstairs. The downstairs played all hip hop and the upstairs was where Kaskade was at. I loved the outside with the pool. Unlike XS I don't think you're allowed to go into the main pool because they had mermaids swimming in it. But you could go into the little pool all the way in the back since they did have some seats and cabanas out there for people to sit on.  If you get on the guestlist and arrive by 11 you get in for free (only applies to the males). Ladies are always free. If males arrive later then 11, 1
I had the day to do what I wanted and this was a place I had to see.  I've been missing it each month so today was the day!  Parking was easy in their lot.  I first took some photos of the monastery and grounds.  It's an interesting place.  Then it was on to the food.  Everything is written in the Thai language so you need to ask what things are.  First things first--when you arrive at the food area, 1
The sandwiches are GIGANTIC. Unfortunately I had just finished a burrito from Chipotle (yes the whole thing, 1
On my way to Laughlin I needed breakfast and stopped here (did not want to stop in Phoenix) and did not want chain restaurant. So glad I did this is going to be my new stop for breakfast when heading that way from Tucson. Service is husband and wife, 1
My new favorite sushi place. From the pics it looks like you get only a few pieces for each roll, 1
Great service and food. They have a large selection of authentic Thai choices, 1
Some of the best sushi I've had! Really creative pieces and dishes I've never had before. Great combination of sauces as well. Love especially how their sushi is wrapped in lettuce..so you really get the taste of the fish vs the rice., 1
Very nice location with really nice employees and very good, 1
Karsen's Grill is the greatest little joint in Scottsdale.  Fabulous burgers, 1
This place is amazing!!   The food is absolutely fantastic!   The service is extremely friendly.  Tulip's will be a definite must every time we come to Charlotte.   The garlic nan was perfect and I had the best Chicken Marsala  ever.   We've been to many Indian Cuisine restaurants in the US and Japan, 1
Always a very friendly staff.  When one of my visits took a little longer than anticipated the comped my bill.  Excellent experience and customer service., 1
I LOVE this spa. I had such an amazing experience with I.V. Therapy and the Obagi Facial. It was my first time for I.V. Therapy and I could definitely tell a difference in my body once I had vitamins and nutrients received. I felt so energized and refreshed even a few days after treatment. Also, 1
A fantastic little corner grocery. I have very modest needs for my shopping--typically just fruit, 1
Great simple Chinese food. We've been going here off and on for years and I'm addicted to their garlic chicken. Staff is helpful, 1
Awesome place. All the food is good and great selection of drinks. On top of the great food the service was even better. The decor inside is done well and its interesting to think about the transformation from a service station to a restaurant., 1
Really enjoy the food here - the lemonade might take getting used to (very strong!), 1
To my knowledge, 1
Update: They got a BYOB license for beer and wine. :), 1
Take and Bake pizza makes sense! It tastes great, 1
This is their third location and it is beautiful. Wow... This is one of the nicest boba tea places I've ever been to. The boba is the best in town. All the ice cream flavors are homemade and absolutely amazing. Not to mention, 1
Wonderful pasta. And the meatballs were sublime if meatballs can be characterized that way. We could never get into the New York, 1
This place was a little confusing as they serve food downstairs but the actual full service restaurant is upstairs. We almost left until a server caught us and escorted us upstairs.   This was a good place for lunch. Fast service. The fried spinach salad was to die for. The tri tip sandwich was just ok though. I could go back and just have three fried spinach salads. It was that good.   Another good option in Tivoli Village., 1
This is my go to Thai place so far on the west side. Cute little place inside, 1
Im was born and raised in sicily. i was aroung legit italian chefs back in my day. overall this pizza tasted just like my dads pizza in italy, 1
This place is great!  I had a pair of pants that needed to be taken up and they were quick to help.  I needed them in a pinch and they got them done, 1
Delicious Coffee. Friendly Staff. Grateful for the Coconut Water & pH balanced Bottled Water. Knocking off one star for the snack selection, 1
This was the second place we went on the joint bachelor(ette) party. I liked the booths here and the different rooms. The women here are more aggressive than other places I have been at...cool deals do your damn thing! Some of my guy friends though being a few drinks in got the wrong idea....sigh.... way to kill it homies. I thought the little vials/shooters were cute....yes I said cute..my guy friends who got them would say hot....whatever works. This place has beautiful staircases and a friendly staff...awesome bottle service.... many thanks and I will definitely come back., 1
Went in today with a friend for her to pick up somethings. I am NOT big on make-up especially near my eyes. After much convincing I was seated in the chair and tricked into putting on some eyeliner. Carlos was so patient with me and fun. He did such a great job. Now if I could figure out how to do it myself. This was not about high pressure sales(side bar great product and not expensive. $12 for eyeliner) but about him really wanting me to see my beauty enhanced. It was a great experience and I will definitely be back!, 1
I LOVE pizza, 1
Having lived in the Valley for 2 years and having become acquainted with many places to shop for new and used cars and not all the dealerships are created equal, 1
Hands down the best Optometrist in town!  Love this place!  Dr. Rago is there to help and will make sure you are taken care of.  Brad and Sharon will help you in the front.  They definitely are a family and treat you like it when you visit!, 1
Tried Earl of Sandwich this past weekend because my cousin recommended for me and her sis to try it since we were in Vegas for the weekend. I had the holiday special which was one of the best sandwiches I've ever tried in my life. It consisted of turkey, 1
My Brother-In-Law gets credit for introducing me to this place.  This is a gold mine for slightly defected (scratched or chipped) furniture and appliances.  It's where the returns from their regular retail store end up.  It's tucked away in the warehouse district of North Las Vegas, 1
I had my Phat Cruiser tuned up there, 1
Definitely love the half price lobster when they had the special. I ordered the lobster with thai chili sauce and it was to die for. I ordered the lobster fried with xo sauce before and it wasn't as good as the thai chili style. Honey walnut prawns were the best. Fried sea bass was fresh too. baby bok choi with garlic was a little greasy but perfect. Word of advice, 1
In Short: The best boba in town, 1
Recently visited for dinner!!  Love love loved their food!  We had the snow crab, 1
Great crawfish, 1
In reviewing the food, 1
AWESOME! the two ladies that helped us were GREAT! Thank you for being so professional. Very nice, 1
Brand spanking new place right in my neighborhood! It's located in the corner of a strip mall that is for the most part vacant, 1
Very prompt and clean.  Basic good service is all I need when it comes to dry cleaning and repairs.  They got a couple very bad stains out, 1
Not so hidden gem indeed!  Flashback to 1980?  Right.  Fantastic service? Check!  What is better than drinking zombies and letting the sweet sounds of Billy Ocean flow over you?  Killing Zombies or actually being by the ocean.  But alas we are in a parking lot in 115 degree heat in Phoenix Arizona.  China Village is wonderful, 1
This is still my favorite mid range casino.  The room rates are great for what you get.  This time I took advantage of the suite upgrade promotion.  For $104 I got a suite.  The room was nice and spacious.  The bathroom was nicely appointed, 1
Generally, 1
What a great Yelp & Groupon combo win. In a search for a new hair salon, 1
Early saturday morning, 1
Beautiful hotel! The pool was fantastic and the rooms are clean and stylish. A thing to think about when staying here is breakfast. You're choices are room service, 1
by far the best massage i have had in Years, 1
I was up in Montreal for vacation with the girlfriend and we were looking for something to do for a few hours prior to the Piknic Electronik and we found this market tour online. We definitely got there a few minutes late for the Jean-Talon market tour, 1
I am a food lover and never spent the time to write a review until I came across this place. I thought this place was finally worth my time to yelp! The porterhouse was perfectly cooked and tender. The crab cakes are absolutely to die for! Our server was also so nice and charming. It was easily the best meal I had on my trip to Vegas. Can't wait to come back here when I'm in town again., 1
I'm from Miami and the thought of eating Chicken and Waffles never seemed appealing to me, 1
Holy cow this place is nice.   I have a family member that is fortunate enough to have a limited (non-golf) membership, 1
Stopped in twice during our Thanksgiving visit to Maricopa because it's not too far from my mother-in-law and sister-in-law's homes. The peanut shells all over reminded me of Jimmy Mac's in my current hometown of Federal Way, 1
We were scrounging around Town Square, 1
Not many people know of this place since it's inside the shopping center, 1
I was at the Joint just the other night and had a great time. Rolling Stone was having a little party up stairs in the balcony during a sold out show, 1
Tri and Lauren and Kate and the rest of the staff are truly amazing at what they do. They sincerely care about the animals that are brought in for care whether for a vet treatment or for boarding. I trust them completely with my furry members of my family., 1
I love when you walk into a place and they have like 5 tables inside and like 20 outside.  It's a true sign of a successful mom and pop place to me.    So... had our party of six outside... it was nice, 1
This was a great place.  The burgers are made well and very juicy.  Price-point is very good.  We were in town for a convention and brought 40 people in and Terrance took great care of our group.  I would definitely go there again., 1
Really good food, 1
I go to Table 274 regularly and am surprised at some of the reviews.  The food is very good.  I generally eat seafood. Its always fresh and well prepared.  Frequently I will just drop in for a quick bite and sit at the bar.  They have a nice wine selection and the small plates are very good especially the fried oysters.  The service is always friendly and prompt. I have never had a bad experience there.  I would give it 4 stars but I am not overly fond of the decor., 1
First time here and I love it already! Love all the flavors and the cute pineapple cup! The girl that was serving me was very helpful since I've never had anything like this before! I have to mention how clean it was too! That is something I always look at going to a new place. I'll be back again!!, 1
I thought that this place would have a homemade from the kitchen feel but it's very modern inside. I wish it would feel more homey..   Aside from that, 1
My favorite place for enchiladas  I order the same thing every time I'm here, 1
My kids love this place and so do I :) it's a great safe environment and I actually can let my kids run around and have fun! Plus the music is awesome and the owner mr john is great with the kids! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to take your kids and there are a ton of class times to pick from and he's rates are great:), 1
It was a recent rainy Saturday morning when I brought my car in for two front tires. The gentleman helping me was very nice and professional. He gave me many options to choose from. I explained my driving habits and he helped me choose what would be best for me, 1
From the minute I walked in, 1
This restaurant is a sister property of the local Lindo Michoacan restaurants. I've never been to any of them, 1
Thank you Dressler family for bringing your Lake Norman restaurant to Midtown! Been here several times to say the least and can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. Great patio, 1
How can you hate a place that sells wall to wall booze?  You can't!  I like having wine around the house anyways, 1
Comin from SF, 1
IKEA is like a real-life Highlights Magazine.    Bring to recollection the hidden pictures, 1
New addition is getting better. Terminals are pretty easy to navigate. I like the vibe in this airport. Could just be Vegas though!, 1
This is the ONLY place I get my nails done because they style the best, 1
I am bringing all of suits and dress shirts here from now on. This place actually tailors your clothes properly so they fit you. I wish I would have known about this place before I let the people at Men's Warehouse ruin my suits I purchased from there.  From now on when I purchase suits I am bringing them straight here. The lady here is a professional and does an excellent job!!, 1
I was back in town a month ago or so, 1
Authentic Asian food.   Not the greasy, 1
Very cool exhibit in Luxor. My wife and I checked this out during a trip to Vegas. It's really an interesting exhibit and there is a lot to learn and appreciate about our bodies., 1
My only gripe is this isn't 24 hours!!!!  Great location - food in the mall for under $10. That's a steal! And they sell beer! And the pizza is good and offers various kinds and toppings., 1
Excellent quality sushi and sashimi.  I was a little disappointed in the mix of the specialty rolls which weren't really to my liking, 1
Since the Elite event I have dropped in a few times and even brought my friend here for her very first legal drink at midnight and dinner. If she's going to have a drink, 1
Lobster Pot Pie...That's all I need to say. It's the most expensive entree I have ever paid for. It was worth it!   In addition, 1
Do you need 3 sticks of cinnamon, 1
Most kid friendly spot I've seen in Vegas!  AND ample places to sit down while watching the wifey shop in an semi-affordable mall.  Some really unique stores.   (This mall just opened a few weeks ago and many of the stores don't have Yelp accounts yet.), 1
Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!  BE THERE!  Two for one breakfast burritos and they kick ass! They're huge, 1
I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and enjoyed it very much. The hotel itself, 1
A great selection and a great place to visit to buy food. It's expansive and includes a good selection of goods.   Now, 1
Tasty and very affordable. For the money and speed of service, 1
Love this place!  Please get a tempest machine., 1
First went to the location in Prague, 1
Great Cebuano food! Excellent service! Staff is very friendly. We had the Ngoyong, 1
I've only ever had White Rabbit at FoodieFest but found out that they had opened a restaurant on Jones so I thought to stop by and grab some food.  I definitely liked their Beefsteak burrito but found it was too much food for me (though not a bad thing, 1
After spending over 4 hours buying a new car on MacDowell, 1
I held my company Christmas party here over the weekend and it was a wonderful experience.    From the moment I requested information on holiday parties back in September and was responded to immediately by the Sales Manager, 1
Nice reasonable price breakfast, 1
Great customer service, 1
One of the best burgers in town!  Awesome fries that come in a tiny shopping basket with ketchup or chipotle sauce.  .  Place has a great vibe.   Burger by itself is about 9.50, 1
Move over Mac's this is my new FAV spot for Q!  I love the location and trendy bar.  There are several huge TV's to watch the game.  There are booths, 1
Dishes were well made. Flavors were distinct and came out pretty fast. Got the tasting menu prixe fixe @ $79. Paid about $100 per person. Loved the tartare. Portions are good with the number of courses.  Only thing that threw me off was the chocolate/peanut butter dessert. Didn't seem like anything special., 1
Great Atmosphere, 1
Love it here!!!  The bartenders are super nice. Planning on coming back again!, 1
Great bagels, 1
Love this place!  Food is always great and the service top notch!, 1
Delicious Asian food but was not impressed by the sushi. The sushi was warm rather than cold like I like it. We've gone here twice waiters work their booties off and give great service. A great place to go as a group the family meal had excellent value., 1
Probably the cheapest sushi in town. Nigiris are a dollar a piece. And most makis are 3-4 pieces for 2-2.5$! Very reasonably priced. The fish is not that fresh but pretty good value for the price you pay! I will definitely come back! The waiter was very nice too., 1
Such a unique place.....a nice change from all of the Frozen Yogurt and Ice Cream places in the area.  The owners are sooooooo nice too.  I love supporting them.  It is nice to know that they are making things with local and fresh ingredients.   Try it, 1
My wife and I purchased a used 2012 Hyundai Sonata with low mileage.  Our salesman, 1
Wow- I come here about 3-4 times a week. Yes I love wally world. As usually I came for one thing and leave with a cart full. The only issue is when it comes to hygiene products the shelves are always out of it, 1
First time here tonight. The service was prompt, 1
When I want to have a couple drinks near home the Dilworth (I like to say Wilmore) location of Common Market is my go-to spot.  It's my spot for grab-and-go beer, 1
I found a coupon on my windshield for a free pita sandwich so I went to the restaurant and got a chicken bruschetta pita and oh man it was so delicious. It was good enough for me to come back again the next night for two more, 1
This was by far one of the best nights I'd ever had in vegas! If you know anything about Vegas club lines, 1
Love this Firehouse Subs location. The staff is always nice and the sandwiches are so delicious. I know when I go to here the sandwiches will be done to my liking and always nice and hot!!! Plus, 1
I order a half order of the bacon onion skillet, 1
As little kids we indulge in painting, 1
Its Jollibee foo! "Joylicious" in every frigging way my friends! Where you can get your Filipino fix of fried poultry, 1
Oh my goodness!!! I'm so full I may need to be rolled back to my hotel... We were told to share food so we did, 1
I'm the Groupon Queen these days and I happened to stumble upon a Groupon for Sky Asian Bistro.  Before purchasing, 1
They've changed a lot since the evolution from Kaib's into BT. The menu is way different and the prices went up, 1
The jalapeno grits are fantastic, 1
Great pizza.  Environment nothing to write home about, 1
We had a tree branch knock a few roof tiles off of our roof during a recent storm.  I came across Stell Roofing here on Yelp and gave Mike a call.  Even though I am sure he was swamped with calls from the storm, 1
Great old style western restaurant, 1
This is our favorite place love it the waitress are friendly. We are here almost every week., 1
This place is great. We stayed 2 nights and had a very good stay. The room was very clean and comfortable - you basically get your own apartment, 1
Just found out that area 15 has a food truck rally every Thursday. I had the chicken hibachi and it was delicious. The only thing was I would have liked more chicken in place of all the veggies but that's only because I'm a meat eater over veggies any day. Also, 1
Wonderful gluten free bakery.  I'm a big fan of their frosted brownie ( dont know its legitimate name but if you go... you;ll see it).  Also, 1
The manager of the restaurant contacted me and was able to get us the reservation on the date we originally wanted. We very much enjoyed the food and the service. I appreciate the gesture to rectify our experience, 1
My problem with Las Vegas hotels: I get lost. They're freaking huge! TI is small enough that you're able to find your elevator, 1
I give it a 5 star because I had an awesome time every tine I went there. You get that Witch Doctor drink and you're set for the night. Awesome view of the Sin City. Gotta say i've only stayed on the terasse..., 1
I love this place! My cousin referred me to this spot! Honestly next to chick a fila this is definitely my fave spot to eat chicken. I love how they don't put too much batter on the chicken! It's not hard and crunchy unlike most chicken strips I've tried, 1
I travel all over North America the majority of the year, 1
This place was great - the environment and service were awesome!  The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I thought the ceviche tasting was small. I also got the "lomo satado" which is stir fry iron steak which was unbelievable!!! The steak was tender, 1
Great reverse happy hour spot.  It was a little warm outside but we opted to dine on the patio since it was a bit busy inside. There was only one other table outside so it was nice. We were going to have a glass of wine each, 1
Came here for one purpose and that sole purpose was to ride the gondola! $16 per person. You get a choice to ride indoor or out. They got deals too to get your photo taken but they allow you to use your own camera if you'd like instead which is awesome. We had a nice person taking us out. She stopped for us to watch the new christmas show which gave me a nice holiday chills. (in a good way)  It was a short and sweet ride, 1
This was a great hotel that we went for a mini staycation.  To be fair to other yelpers, 1
Went here with the family not expecting much, 1
Perhaps one of the cleanest Korean BBQ's I've been to. The staff was extremely attentive, 1
Sometimes craziness strikes me and I push myself to attend work out classes at 6am even though I went to bed late. Then their are times that I might be going completely insane and attend two classes. Unfortunately, 1
Sushi Roku will always have a special place in the heart of my wallet. I was in vegas for a bachelor party. Initially my group of 16 was going to eat at Texas de Brazil, 1
Only 1 other review? This place is a locals late-night hotspot! Cheap specials and decent food.  As noted always a Best of Vegas breakfast contender. Not really that good but consistent and CHEAP. $2.99 Pancakes & Eggs, 1
First visit here, 1
This new location is fantastic! Patio is great with misters, 1
Mmmhmm. Sonics after the club, 1
The most GORGEOUS club in all of Vegas (if not the world) The decor, 1
Always a fan and love their food.  The 14th Street pizza is my favie but this time it tasted different.  It was good but it was not GREAT!!!  =(  The service was great., 1
I liked the experience we had here, 1
One of my favorite lunch spots if I am going to sit down and really enjoy lunch.  This is a good spot to take client or have any kind of business lunch.  Elegant modern setting, 1
An awesome family owned establishment with good food and great prices. No Clancy's trip is complete until you do at least one shot of fireball and don't forget to try the weekly lunch specials. If you're looking for a nice non-douche bag neighborhood Scottsdale bar you found it!, 1
Ordered a pizza recently due to not wanting to cook at home after a long day at work.  Stopped by the store, 1
I've had all the work on my car done here.  They've been nothing but straight up with me and fair with pricing!, 1
Go for the $7.77 special (not on the menu) and you won't be disappointed.  We used to only go to Ellis Island for our cheap steak dinner but this one has it beat.  The steak is a better cut, 1
So I had originally expected the worst from this place considering all the reviews I had read on here. Especially considering the fact that the last time I went to Vegas I stayed at the Bellagio, 1
Came here for a valentine's dinner with the hubby. Small space but the food's flavor makes up for it immensely. We ordered the Kolkata pani puri for starters. Little hollowed out puffed pastries stuffed with potatoes and chick peas, 1
I'm so a fan of this place! It's an actual old church with a brewery on the pulpit! The food is good, 1
One of my favorite new ways to beat the heat: Taiwanese ice cream! Actually it's shaved ice with a very unique texture. Also, 1
Tried this place mid week for lunch. I ordered n6, 1
I love New Horizons Med Spa.  The staff there is great and take very good care of me.  Thank you!, 1
I would probably give this 4 1/2 stars may be even five.  This place is fantastic.  For those who have traveled to Germany - this is the place to go that will bring back all your favorite memories.  First I have to give them kudos for having authentic German beer (my favorite is about 4th or 5th, 1
Tony is awesome. The best hair cut I have had here in the valley. I will be a regular. I am glad I found him, 1
Like a previous reviewer, 1
The Italian beef was delicious! I haven't tried anything else but the Italian beef is better than most that I've had.  The bread was tasty and the au jus definitely made it better.  It is a little pricey but I'd eat here again., 1
Boar's Head meat and thick toasted bread make these sandwiches some of my favorite.  The soups are okay, 1
i ordered the Pork Chop (chargrilled with a roasted pear bubble & squeak cake, 1
We have driven by this place a zillion times, 1
Great ambiance and super good sushi, 1
Despite the fact that Saffron is a little far north for us to drive, 1
4 &1/2 stars for this great dive. We drove up from San Diego and got here at 1am and by then, 1
just moved around the corner from Flor De Michoacan. On a referral went into check it out. WOW! The owner Floyd happened to be there and let my wife and I sample all kinds of ice cream. It was amazing! We now go almost every single day. Stephanie and Gabriella are the nicest ladies and represent well. You can see the pride in their Hispanic heritage in their service levels. You gotta try the strawberries and creme. The best. U GOTTA GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY. I just have to workout more now! lol  Customer for life, 1
Big Lots is one of those places where it's filled with leftovers. Whether it's trash or treasures is for those to decide. Most of the time that I've gone in is because it's a bored day and sometimes I find things that are amusing.   Today I was pleasantly surprised I found stuff.   For us, 1
Great BBQ. Service is what you get in LV, 1
Sally's have the finest unique eyewear in Charlotte.  The quality is superb and great customer service.  I own two pairs of glasses from Sally's and I get many compliments when I wear them.  I will only purchase my eyewear from Sally's Optical Secrets.  Stephanie H., 1
It was once again Restaurant Week, 1
is this the only place in vegas that has banh mi? i love banh mi...so i love hue thai!!! i usually order the charbroiled beef banh mi...i've also tried the cold cut sandwich, 1
the tea is nicely priced and is to die for. although the food is a bit pricy, 1
I must be a sucker for wine bars....they are just so good! I went to Timo after finding it on Yelp while hiking North mountain with my step mom Deb. We were hiking and, 1
This is a very good restaurant. The atmosphere is beautiful; very well decorated. The set up with the fountain is amazing. The servers are very friendly and very nice. Extremely helpful if it is your first time at a Brazilian steakhouse.   Now, 1
Just for You is a nice down to earth salon/spa.  They are not over the top with prices or unnecessary extravagance.  Crystal Kraft does my hair and does an amazing job keeping me blonde.  Jessie that works next to her is really nice too.  JFY has aesthetics rooms for facials and waxing.  I have not tried one of the facial or waxing services yet, 1
Love this place.  It inspires healthful cooking and makes me want to be a better cook.  The best of the best., 1
Addendum to my 3/4/2013 posting:  We are having a garage built and found out that we needed to have a termite treatment prior to the pouring of the cement foundation.  I called David 3 days before the pour and he set me up the afternoon before the pour...saying he would leave open slots for 3 days...just needed to let him know when they needed to be there to do the treatment.  I give them 5 stars....and would recommend NO ONE ELSE to take care of your termite needs!!!!!!, 1
Took my wonderful wife to Geisha House for Valentine's Day, 1
Very fresh and tasty food. Soy chicken was better than real chicken ;-) completely vegetarian... A rare option!  Very friendly staff too!!, 1
Best macaroons in the Valley  Heard about Essence's macaroons from a friend and hit the place up.  It's a small shop-- maybe 12 table tops total, 1
spent 4 days at this hotel in mid october. very pleasant stay in one of their corner suites which are have a very nice lay out with 2 bathrooms. i found the technology in the room to be bothersome. perhaps if i were an invalid hospital patient the bedside controls for the entire suite would be handy but i really don't mind flipping a light switch manually. (that's just me) all of the staff members were excellent, 1
So the first time we tried come here, 1
Quick and good. No place to sit, 1
Been going here for over 10yrs now...my husband loves it too. Great Prices and Great Food! We try to go here weekly since it's cheaper than cooking. I love the seafood, 1
What a fantastic place.  I signed up and visited them for the first time today.  I have really good health insurance, 1
Just recently discovered Lush. I'd walked by it and enjoyed the scents many times but I had neve gone in until a couple weeks ago when I went with a friend who had heard about their buy 1 get 2 free soap or buy 1 get 1 gift box sale. I ended up getting the "Secret Santa" gift box as a gift for a friend and kept the free one for myself which included a Snowcake soap and a Satsumo Santa bath bomb. I'd been using the Snowcake soap and loved it, 1
Best nail salon EVER! I do not and will not go anywhere else! Clean, 1
My husband and I have been waiting to come here but never get the chance to. From what I understand, 1
We had them cater our food for a high school graduation party--The food was FABULOUS!!!!  The fried fish was crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The baked & fried chicken was fresh, 1
Very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I love when laundromats use the cards instead of coins!, 1
I've been going to the Orleans for years.  The casino is more of a "locals" casino who has a history of taking care of their players.  I don't consider myself a hardcore gambler but I do play enough for them to hook me up with rooms and food.  That alone keeps me coming to the Orleans and  "donate" to their cause.  The casino is clean and provides good food and service.  The only bad part is that it is not on the strip.  If you are looking for the "strip" experience, 1
I've never reviewed a restaurant before, 1
Love this place!  The food and service is amazing!  The portions are gigantic and happy hour is half off everything but drinks!  happy hour is 3-6!, 1
Lunch on a Saturday equals brunch. Really? Oh well. At least most of the food is the same on the brunch menu.   Couldn't stop by without an order of the frozen hot chocolate. Yummm. On a hot day outside, 1
Great little dive in bar. Bartenders and people are very chill. Drinks are fairly priced., 1
We had some perfectly cooked burgers in a surprisingly quiet restaurant in Mandalay Bay.  Service was really good, 1
never been, 1
We came here to get the screen fixed on a phone and it was a great. breath of fresh air the staff was very friendly told us the price and that it would take 2 hours to fix..... 2 hours later we received a phone call that the phone was ready  to pick up  ....... The phone looked brand new and it comes with a 30 day warranty, 1
Best sandwiches in CU.  Also the best humus dishes.  If you go make sure you try the following combo:  1. Sour dough bread, 1
Eat is a new restaurant one block east and one block south of the El Cortez.  First of all, 1
My family picks up all their prescriptions from this location and it never takes long, 1
I have no idea where the boyfriend found this place but he suggested for us to go here and we all loved it!   I had the bulgogi and katsu combo and I loved the katsu. It came out hot and crispy. Bulgogi was okay because I was expecting it to be Korean flavored but it wasn't so it threw me off a little. I would go for the teriyaki next time instead because my boyfriend had that and it was amaze-balls    All in all, 1
On the hunt for some authentic NC barbeque, 1
Been here multiple times.  Food and service are consistent and friendly.  Excellent., 1
The word "ramen" usually conjures up 10 cent instant noodle packs you can buy at the gas station; the main food staple for many college students. However, 1
Freddys hands down has some of the best shakes/concreates/custard is LV and NV for that matter.  That mind you, 1
The service at this location is outstanding.  At my last visit, 1
I really liked this place. They were able to make my toe nail that was injured look normal again. They also throw in a neck massage!, 1
Another venture in Vegas always leads to eating some kind of fucken asian food. WHY?!!?! I LIVE IN GARDEN GROVE!! We go to vegas and eat ASIAN FOOD! WTF?!  So as I am dragged around by others, 1
I love that they are now at Canyon Ridge church on weekends, 1
My mom and I had dinner here recently and really enjoyed it.  I did make a reservation several weeks in advance but easily got the time I wanted.  We were sat in a back corner near the windows but it was actually nice back there.  More quiet than the main dining space.  The view of the strip is awesome.  You can see the Bellagio fountains right next store.  We started with drinks.  I just had a basic Ginger Ale but my mom had a Bombay Sapphire and tonic.  I think they make their own ice or get it from some place special as the ice was perfectly square cubes.  Really cool.  My mom's drink was strong so that was good too.  For our appetizers, 1
I've always been happy with my meals over at AZ '88. They have an interesting take on sandwiches and blend in spicy wing sauce with a few of their dishes, 1
This has got to be the most professional and well managed iHop I've been to in Vegas!   We got there on a Sunday morning at around 10:30. Even though there was a lobby full of customers waiting, 1
One liner:  GREAT employees!  I love shopping at Hyvee, 1
so beautiful and suitable place. Really worth it! It's the best one among hotels which have the comparative price!! Love it!!!!, 1

Giacomo's has exceptional food at great prices.  If you're looking for New York style pizza, 1

Haven't been to the restaurant but the deli is top-notch with fresh sliced italian meats. Always great service and great sandwiches. Kids love the spaghetti & meatballs too! They also have a really nice Italian market., 1
Initially what attracted me to this restaurant was the decor.  The old style  Hollywood photos, 1
1.  Thank you Yelpers for the recommendation.  2.  Get off the strip and come try these tacos.  They are one of a kind and well worth the effort of finding a way to get here.  Words cannot describe how good these things are!   Other pros -- the tacos are super cheap - dirt cheap - compared to anything on or near the strip.  They also take credit cards!  3.  Adobada.  4.   Learn to say Adobada -- that's what you're going to want to order!  I tried a variety of tacos.  All were great, 1
In reality I should probably give this place four-stars but there are some intangibles that give this restaurant the boost into five-star country for me.  I must admit, 1
Un bon vieux bar de quartier qui s'est refait une beaut\u00e9, 1
What a great place to have innovative Pizza and other delicious dishes. Always great tasting food, 1
I love this food I can eat it everyday . They always treat you  so good the food is always better than the last time I ate it . They are fast with all the food   . I love the music they play . Lmao it's a great place to eat ., 1
If you need an obscure part for plumbing or electrical work this is the place to go in East Phoenix. The employees are very helpful and friendly and the selection is great., 1
My wife ordered bun tom thit nuong, 1
Great place with a large growing collection of local artists and friendly people., 1
First I just want to say I hate getting in front of a camera and Lisa made it such a joy to be photographed.  I had been admiring Moxie studio's website for sometime and I was unsure what to expect and Lisa had exceeded my expectations.  She is completely dedicated and professional.  My family and I fell in love with her and her creativity.  When we were able to view the website there wasn't a photo I didn't want to purchase.  Moxie's prices are very reasonable . I have found a photographer for life.  I will no longer work with anyone else.  We LOVE you MOXIE Studio!!!, 1
Great place for families. Staff was super nice and went out of way to help on a number of occasions. Especially Casey at front desk and Shahara who worked in the restaurant!, 1
It's not really my type of scene, 1
Well of course you're named after a Saint. After all, 1
Came here on a Saturday night with my girlfriends at 7pm. We got seated right away; our waiter was nice, 1
This is one of my favorite places! I highly recommend the jalapeno cilantro hummus. I've never had anything like it and I could seriously eat it by the bucketful. The tabouli is great, 1
They have great service and salads! Will definitely be returning in the near future!, 1
ah Marquee..  the new IT club in vegas.  i came here just last weekend 3/4/11 & Dirty South was spinning  Tips: 1.) get there EARLY !! seriously the line starts forming around 830, 1
Micah has outdone himself yet again. Not only are the cocktail selections from the menu outstanding and completely unique, 1
A friend and I had lunch here today. Service was very attentive. The Buffett had a lot of options the saag paneer and chicken tikka masala was very good. Price was great for lunch. I will be back again, 1
Bliss! Amazing prices and a lovely, 1
I'm looking to get more high end cookware for my cooking and came here just to have a look around and check out an exclusive Le Creuset item they have.  Walked in and was quickly helped by a gentleman named Don who was extremely experienced. I asked him nearly every question I had and he spent a solid 20 minutes with us giving his opinion on what I should do.   He emphasized that he didn't work on commission and really wanted us to take our time in deciding which gave our experience a really nice, 1
$1 el pastor tacos, 1
Absolutely a healthy favorite that doesn't skimp on flavor, 1
Fluff- A little disappointed about how they didn't serve ice cream on top like the picture shown on yelp but it was still good! I just wished they put mochi in the fluff instead of that weird Italian custard thing.. it was sour and just did not go along with the green tea or red bean at all.    Drinks- I asked for a jasmine green milk tea and although it was a tad bit sweet, 1
Down right amazing coffee! This place has the most smooth tasting coffee I've had! The flavor combinations are perfect and so is the temperature of the coffee!   The ambience is great and the laptop station with wifi is a sure hit. I loved the decor and spacious layout! the high ceilings make you feel more comfortable. It doesn't feel cramped and you don't worry about people hearing private conversations either!   The baristas were friendly and my drink came out promptly! The pastries looked amazing! (I wanted one so bad) Next time I go I'll splurg a little and try one! Yes there will be a next time! I'm hooked!, 1
I came here for their buffet lunch, 1
Great little restaurant - good food, 1
I have been searching for a proper chicken pot pie since the weather got colder & saw here on Yelp that the Roasting Co had chicken pot pies on Wednesdays.  Clearly, 1
This store is always clean, 1
Great spread. $$ $51 + tax for weekend dinner. Has crab legs, 1
Garlic naan is wonderful.  Had the chicken biriyani, 1

The food was very good and the service was excellent.  This is a good Restaurant for a Birthday or Anniversary Celebration., 1
Tiestooooo's Club Life!  I came here last weekend to see Tiesto like many of the other Yelpers here.  I was blown away by the entire show and I couldn't have asked for a better night.  I was with a great group of friends and the music made us all feel the love that night.  I had no problems with will call and waited in a 2 minute line to get my ticket.  It was actually a really relaxing concert entrance compared to other concerts that I have been to at places like Staples or the Honda Center.  The Joint was spacious: large without being ginormous.  When we walked in around midnight the intro dj was still spinning.  While waiting for Tiesto, 1
I dinned at Aureole over the holidays and had a wonderful time.  There were two major issues I had with the place.  One, 1
This place is so good !!! The owners are sweet people mmmmm I'm hungry now, 1
Very great place I loved the food and the servers were amazing! Wish they had a bigger inside especially for this time of the year but overall I will be back and really recommend this place to anyone, 1
Efficace et pas cher., 1
Our party of 4 sat outside on their patio and loved chatting and catching up. We had a few entrees and some drinks.  The server was friendly and attentive and checked up on us often which is appreciated when sitting outside.  I hate dining outdoors somewhere and then feel like they forgot about us.  Thumbs up to a nice neighborhood restaurant/bar.  They serve a pretty good burger., 1
Enjoyed the perfect meal last night. Sangria, 1
Good Mexican food. Family business . Service is great. Green salsa is the bees knees. Worth the visit., 1
Haven't purchased a car from here but have had service done. The GM Mike is a great guy and very committed to customer service. Any time I've had a question or concern, 1
This is a business-class hotel, 1
I am a very picky dog owner, 1

My boyfriend had the bleu burger and proclaimed "this burger tastes the way boobs look" and said it was the best burger he's ever eaten. I had the veggie burger, 1
As we were walking around Mandalay we were hungry for some breakfast and we needed to grab something quick. We came along to this nice shop that sold yogurt which is self service and pay by the weight of your item. I noticed they also sell crepes which i was in the mood for.  Thinking that it was just mediocre crepes, 1
Had I written this review prior to my visit to Cardiff then Real Foods may have scored 5 stars. However, 1
Just had dinner there again last night. There are a number pluses for this restaurant that I hadn't notice the last time. We ordered a soup and to our pleasant surprise it wasn't over salted as many other Chinese  restaurants would probably do. The Peking Duck is definitely markedly different compared to others I've tried in Montreal - the crepe is steamed and hence warm and soft. The salt and pepper tofu is very savory. The lobster noodle is another dish that's worth a try. And the complimentary dessert at the end topped off our evening., 1
It's a rare thing to visit an aquarium centralized in the middle of a desert, 1
Great atmosphere and great food. This place must be the real deal considering (what seemed like) the entire Taiwanese population of Pittsburgh was eating there.   We had the spicy wonton and pork soup dumpling. Both were incredibly good. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes., 1
My husband and I went for lunch at Luke Wholey's over the weekend.  He sampled the lobster bisque  fries as a meal.  I asked him to have the bisque on the side since we usually share and I love the bisque by itself.  I also thought it would be great dipping sauce but I like to decide how much I want on things.  Wow I am glad I did.  The big cup of bisque was great for dipping and the cheesy garlic fries were crispy and good. Lots of Lobster pieces strewn throughout.  I also had the trio with nice scallop and shrimp and piece of fish.  Everything fresh and good.  The infused vodkas are a real draw with bartender Joby coming up with some great concoctions to tempt you to have one more.  Luke was ever present with his great smile and welcoming attitude.   Luke, 1
I enjoy taking my kids to this yogurt place. The only thing I'd change is for them to get some more flavors/change them more often. It seems like everytime I go they have the same flavors and it gets boring. Other than that it's a great place. Tastes good, 1
I'm so happy that Bread and Butter is close to home because whenever I'm in town, 1
Went here for breakfast. Food was great. Service was great. Price was great. I've heard this place is very lively at night as well. Would definitely recommend., 1
I have gone here a few times and its not luxurious, 1
After living in Montreal for almost 5 months, 1
$19 rooms.  A free airport shuttle (I've hopped it while staying at another hotel!)  Cheap buffet that's reminiscent of college dorm cafeteria food.  Terrible's rocks., 1
This Mexican fast food restaurant looks run down but the food is good. I like their daily specials Monday thru Friday. 99 cent Taco's on Tuesday and 99 cent Bean burrito's on Wednesday. 60 cents to add cheese.   There is one friendly old Mexican guy that works around midnight to 6AM. He makes the best Bacon, 1
As an AirBnB host we struggle sometimes to give breakfast recommendations out to our guests. Sure we want to send them to Pamela's or Coca for the best taste of what the 'Burgh has to offer, 1
great tradition every year in Las Vegas! loved it's a great to be able to pack the kids in the car and stay warm and cozy while you drive through the amazing light show!! awesome place to go for some family time!!, 1
Simple, 1
Caf\u00e9 Joe or Caf\u00e9 Slow as some call it is simply GREAT!  The food is delicious and inexpensive and I don't mind the slow service because I know what I'm getting into when I sit down. Plus, 1
We had a party of 6 and enjoyed free breadsticks as we were first time guests. Our service was friendly and attentive. The lasagna and Fruiti De Mare were both amazing and the children's portions were large! The only thing that keeps me from 5 stars was the wine selection. I would like to see a better selection to accommodate the wonderful food., 1
It's always a good feeling leaving your hair stylist knowing you look good. I have been going here for a few years and I have never been disappointed. You do not need to worry about getting a cut that doesn't work for your face or your style. Only draw back is the parking, 1
This place was truly a highlight of our Vegas dining experiences when we went a few weeks ago! It and Raku were my two favorites by far.  We went without reservations probably around 7 or 7:30 on a Saturday night and were seated right away.  Although by the time we left the place had mostly filled out. Our sever was very helpful and the the beer we ended up with was fantastic. They had a great beer selection that was listed on an iPad for the table to look over. We sat in the dining area but the bar looked great as well. The atmosphere was laid back, 1
This place is new & can get pretty busy.... But the food is awesome & the employees are Great...., 1
The best breakfast bargain there is - no pretense - very attentive servers - the burgers are great also.  My husband rates their patty melt as one of the best he has had. This is a wonderful gem of the old fashioned diners - we have been here dozens of times and never had food that wasn't really really good.  Never a problem with service., 1
For those that don't know this use to be a spot called Rum Jungle back in the day and was quite small. Cirque real turned this place out. One dance floor which as others said is small compared to other places. Whos says you need a dance floor to dance? So many things going on!! Love all the performs walking around on platforms from the sky where ever you are there is something going on.  Good to be a girl as we didn't wait too long. This place is great and hope it stays!!, 1
I live close by and just placed my first order this evening - hibachi chicken.  I was very pleased with my meal...lots of nice white chicken with lots of veggies!  It came with an abundant amount of rice as well as two dipping sauces and soup.  I am so happy to have this place so close.  It is definitely my new "go to" place!!!  I think the less fanatic reviews were probably from when they first opened and had a learning curve.  Definitely worth trying!!!, 1
What a nice surprise! My car was actually washed at a car wash!  So I drove up, 1
It's close to home. Doesn't really differ from other theaters. Easy to get into and isn't ever super packed (like Rave always is down the street). I do love that they offer the early bird special tickets at $6.75, 1
These guys are amazing! We used them in our last move- friendly, 1
A little bit of normaly in Sin City. Located across from the Wynn this is a great spot to getsome good food at understandable prices and not have to wait all night for a seat. Went twice on a recent trip and both times enjoyed the meal. They also have great salsa (3 different styles) with the usual table chips and nice Margaritas (not too tart like most). As a vegetarian I found some choices besides the std veggie quesadilla. Would be a 5 with a little better service and broader menu but would for sure recommend and go back again., 1
They take great care of East Madison Toyota. Always prompt and friendly. Food is what you'd expect. Bread is way better then Subway, 1
I just wanted to say how courteous and knowledgeable the team at Anthem Majestic Dentistry is from the moment i walked in the door! I am also pleased with the expert knowledge of Dr. Wolf with his state of the art techniques, 1
We have eaten breakfast at this spot more times than I can remember!    I love the quick-service concept.  It makes it easier to go with friends, 1
Went to grab a quick lunch today and this place was recommended.  There is ample parking and is located in a shopping plaza.  We got there early and there was plenty of parking, 1
Meat & Potatoes is one of the best, 1
The four stars really was for the Deluxe Pet Stay Room on a non-pet floor.    Arrived in Ceasars for our Holiday in Vegas (familly for Xmas) with Apricot the fluffy white dog in tow.  It has the most complicated Valet parking with its winding road to the self-parking and separate Valet for the Colosseum (theater).  We were redirected to the Main Entrance where they mentioned that it might be difficult to get valet parking because it was busy unless you were Diamond or Seven Stars member of the Total Rewards program.  Somehow with Apricot, 1
Such a fun and delicious frozen dessert! I love gelato!   The employee's are all friendly and happy to let you taste any of there delicious flavors. Personal fav's are the hazelnut, 1
The pizza is a bit pricey - but the variety is worth a look. For two slices you are looking around $7. The slices are big, 1
Went in for an oil change and to get my car inspected for my rebuilt title. Jarrod and alexi were verry professional and honest and polite. This is the only shop i trust to work on my car for ANY maintainance. These guys know what theyre doing., 1
Probably my second favorite breakfast place in Phoenix, 1
Visit here several times a year. The food is always fresh and well stocked. They have sushi, 1
Went to the Breadfruit for lunch today and am sad I've never been here before! It was so delicious! My both my meal and my wife's was to die for. The atmosphere is also really nice with some good reggae playing and the service was excellent.  I will definitely be going back for more., 1
I have been here twice recently and I think this is my new go-to place. There are other sports bar/happy hour places close by, 1
Every time I visit this place, 1
It's more of a 4.5 but I can't round up to a perfect 5 so I have to round down. This place is great. They are still very new so when we went in they still hadn't finished completing the decor of the restaurant. Because of that we were a little worried but it basically took one bite for us to realize we made the right choice.   The barbecue itself was excellent. We got a half chicken and an order of ribs. They were both moist and tender and the glaze was delicious. As far as the sides go the macaroni and cheese is a must have. Really good flavor. We also got the BBQ beans which were good, 1
My family and I have dinner here at least 4 times a month.  They have excellent pizza and terrific wings.  Sometimes, 1
2 words: Go There!!    Food and service are top notch. We only ordered 6 things (in addition to the free popcorn w the perfect seasoning of spice and subtle sweetness), 1
It's been 2 months today since this fantastic new Buffet opened, 1
So I finally got a chance to check out Gallo Blanco. I live in the area, 1
This was my first time at a small/community theater. I had such a great time! I went to see "And Then There Were None" by Agatha Christie. Great cast..loved that everyone used a British accents. I got my tickets through an email for "show up". We had 2nd row. The sound was great, 1
Unbelievably Great! You can enjoy the smells from the time you pull up! Mmmmmmm! Great old school charm, 1
I went here for breakfast during a visit with my Grandma.  This place is located in your typical active senior living community clubhouse thing.  It was nice and overlooked the golf course.  It was about 11am on a Sunday and wasn't overly crowded which surprised me.  Their menu was pretty standard and had all your typical breakfast fare at very reasonable prices.  I opted for the omelet station where they had a bunch of fresh ingredients to add, 1
I go here for my company bowling league. They have decent lanes and a good amount of lane balls that actually fit my hand! The food is ok, 1
PCP recommended Dr. Tindall two years ago. He was unavailable and I saw Dr. Pappas. Ended up having surgery and that joint feels excellent now. Staff is friendly and actually respond the voice messages.   I agree with David M's suggestion on scheduling 100%., 1
We finally made it down to the Downtown Cocktail Room after years of talking about it and I am glad we did .  The lounge has a very sexy, 1
My wife and I had a wonderful dinner here. All of the food was super fresh and delicious. Also, 1
I have never been inside always do drive through. Food is tasty and friendly service. BUT the inside table and floors are very dirty. Please do a major clean up!, 1
I'm gonna go on a limb here first start off by saying the other reviews, 1
First time here with the family ordered the steamer and the hero and was not disappointed at all. Very generous portion for the meats and very tasty. Staff is also very friendly. Definitely adding this place on my go to places., 1
Tried their new store at 3140 S. Gilbert Road...very hard to find (no frontage, 1
I had a print job that would make or break an awesome deal, 1
Used to love yo sushi until I discovered Edinburgh's other Japanese restaurants! Not to say I hate it, 1
Stay away!  It seems like there is an over emphasis on motor vehicle accidents (more lucrative billing?). That and poor office management!  After a long relationship with this place the billing department finished me off.  They sent a bill for services allegedly rendered well over a year in the past with no explanation.  When I called to ask about why I was getting a bill in 2012 for service in 2010 there was no explanation.  Several times I asked for an explanation and/or for John Baca to give me a call and explain and I'd be happy to pay the bill.  I've know Baca since 1998.  No They sent me to collections for $24.00  I asked John Baca face to face -- he told me that could send a bill for service 10 years ago if they wanted to, 0
I ordered the eggs benedict and although the actual eggs Benedict was delicious, 0
Boooo.  Straight razor shave wrecked my skin for three days. Mandalay's facilities are much more luxurious and complete., 0
Pass.  I tried Lemon Grass for takeout and was as disappointed as many of my fellow Yelpers here.  The Pad Thai was bland and generic, 0
Ce restaurant est maintenant malheureusement ferm\u00e9, 0
The grounds are beautiful but the room is a motel 6 quality.  I was put in the back in what they call a candida.  It was so small.  You could hear the guests next door talking coughing and other things I won't mention in case it's a kid reading this.  The staff was friendly. It's just this old hallway and time room.  Eeeew, 0
AVOID this store!   Rude employees, 0
I think ill stick to eating my two bannanas with an apple for lunch than try something like this again. And ill make this short and to the point.  I didnt have that high of expectations coming to this place anyway as a pizza buffet cant really be all that bad or good right? Walked in at 12 noon for the lunch buffet for $7.02 total and got my little plate in hand. The pickings were light and didnt have much to offer in terms of a buffet, 0
Worst nail place ever! Came in to get a ped/full set. As I was choosing my polish, 0

Stayed here for business last week and my reaction is: meh.    Nothing special about this Scottsdale Road property.  It was really pretty expensive $279/night in April and you don't get a lot for your money.    Nothing "wrong" with the place, 0

Yuck  Pizza tasted ok til we found a hair..  Say what? Yes a hair..  Lady presumably the owner refused to believe it was true and we had to pay for everything..  Also don't touch anything, 0
This is the WORST Vegas experience I have ever had.  -When entering the casino on the way to registration you get attacked by the sale staff trying to get you to go to shows and asking you for tons of personal information -I paid $20 for an early check in and was completely dismissed at the front counter telling me to come back 3 hours later. They wouldn't upgrade my room or even refund my $20 dollars -The room smelled of smoke and was fugly. -The place was ramparting with kids, 0
Craving a good burger and based on a co-workers advise decided to try out Blue 32 Sports Grill. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Since this was our first time here she explained how everything was fresh made on site.   I always want an explanation of "seasonings" as some are "spicy" seasonings and I don't do spicy.  The onion rings were seasoned with both black pepper and cayenne pepper. The onion rings were evenly sliced and had a nice "crunch" to them. After the 3rd onion ring they started really getting to "hot" for me. I would suggest using the cayenne pepper as an add-in for those who like spicy foods.   I also ordered the Blue 32 Steak Sandwich. I expected to get thinly sliced  Steak instead I got something that resembled hamburger cubed steak.  The mushrooms were not sliced but rather "cubed" . The onions were also chopped up. It would have been nice to have the mushrooms and onions sliced up and caramelized together on the grill then tossed in with grilled STEAK and cheese mixed in (instead the cheese was "blobbed" on"  I am a mom that loves to cook and has a family that loves to eat my cooking. When I go out to eat (doesn't matter where) I want to have something that I either don't cook at home or just blows me away and makes me want to try cooking it home with equal or better restaurant results.  I will give Blue 32 another try and see if my taste buds are telling me what others are saying., 0
Good food but way overpriced if you're going to spend $100+ for two people and you will even without drinks here go somewhere with a nice view instead!, 0

If you don't mind bad service and cheap mediocre food this is your place to eat.  The breakfast deal that they have is what caught our eye.  My friends and I just wanted to get something in our stomachs.  We thought it will be quick fast food but we were wrong.  The service here is just HORRIBLE.  After we were seated, 0

A friend of mine was just talked into joining this gym last week. 18 year old who hadn't experienced the classic "gym" sales crap. AFTER they accpeted his membership fee and first and last.. THIS GYM IS SHUTTING DOWN in TWO WEEKS!! What a joke!   So everyone was correct in their previous posts that this place should shut down but they shouldn't have accepted any memberships knowing they were closing in two weeks., 0
Their Happy Hour just changed- Everything cost more and they got rid of a lot of their food specials. Even prices on drinks have gone up especially pitchers of Modelo, 0
So after reading the reviews for this place I was psyched to finally get my hands on a tasty gyro sandwich. I made the eleven minute drive from my apartment to Mike and Tony's Gyros and Shish-Kabobs and I was rather disappointed.   French Fries: Delicious, 0
I thought this might be a good place to have my daughter's 5th birthday. We invited her friends, 0
Why is this place rated so highly??? And why is it considered Mexican food?? Sweet potatoes are not Mexican food.... neither are apples, 0
Ran over here for a quick lunch. I had the gyro which another worker said he picked up as well. I have had quite a few gyro's (pronounce  gy-ro here for some reason; east coast thing?) so I do have some experience eating these things.  It wasnt exactly what I expected. I agree with the previous review that the meat did taste a little funny. But the white sauce... I hope you sure like garlic, 0

This is strictly for the Beach and the concerts held there.  Just got back from a girls weekend in vegas.  As part of our trip we booked tixs to see the Bangles at the beach here.  We arrive knowing that its general admission but no where on the website or upon entrance are you told you'll be sitting in the sand and that they do not provide towels for you sit on.  So that's the first beef - 1.  Could you not provide towels for us to sit on?? 2.  Why not print on the tix - bring your own towel for seating?? 3.  Lines for drinks very long and very slow 4.  Sound system is awful - I mean awful.  The sound kept bouncing off the buildings and there was a lot of feedback thru the speakers.  I will not pay to attend another concert here at the beach.  Cool concept - bad delivery of it., 0

I spent 25 minutes reading reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try.  Mistake.  I wish I'd tried somewhere else for dry cleaning.  I got ready to wear my favorite shirt out and discovered it had all kinds of stains on it (that amazingly weren't there before!).  A friend and I had planned our clothing to match for a special night so it was a scramble to change everything because the shirt was a mess.  It hadn't occurred to me it would return dirtier than I gave it to them, 0
Oh man.. I just want to get some sanitizing wipes and wipe this place from top to bottom! Some parts of the upstair game area smells literally like rotting trash.   I understand this place is great for kids with all the games and prizes they can win. But come on! Spend a little bit of money and clean up / face lift this place. It's truly depressing how run down this casino is.   If I had kids, 0
Location is great with the opportunity to eat outdoors if the weather co-operates while food and service were mediocre at best. Salmon was dry, 0
They work off commission and will try to sell you a bunch of unnecessary repairs. They even showed a picture they had taken after inspection of a supposedly dirt filled coil that desperately needed cleaning.   We weren't born yesterday so after getting their laundry list of repairs, 0

Very unhappy..... wanted a pizza quarter pepperoni and rest veggie... The told me they were unable to do it and that it's there policy. ... really.... policy to tell a guest NO..... are they incapable of doing it? Is it to hard to just put pepperoni on just like 2 pieces worth? Been running restaurants for 18yrs and never heard of telling a custom no when your capable of doing it....wow been going for years hear and there to the Deer Valley location but maybe never again..., 0
I'm torn on how to review this restaurant. Given the lack of choices in da Burgh for Brazilian steakhouses, 0
This is NOT a place for kids.  They will be rude to you even if you just spent $25 in food for them.  Band was terrible., 0
I have been to several different Romano's locations and I was very upset with my recent experience at this location. When we first walked in it smelled like sewer. It was disgusting. So we opted to sit outside as it was really nice out. Our sever was slow and kept forgetting things and then our food came out cold! That was not cool, 0
Missing lots of stores, 0
I went to Ulta salon because I wanted a cheaper decent haircut.  I got one of the worst haircuts I have ever received.  My layers were terrible and when I got home I noticed my bangs weren't even trimmed properly.  I think cost cutters would have done a better job.  The stylist Tricia even stated that straight hair shows every mistake.  Wow was she right.  Too many layers on the right, 0

I can't say if Pirate's Fish and Chips was good or bad because it was so unforgettable which to me means it must not have been very good. I never forget a tasty fried food. I went there a while ago and was just not that impressed.  It was okay but no better than Long John Silver's, 0

One question.  W T F ?  1. I am only giving this hotel two stars because we had prepaid online and ended up needing to cancel our second/last night and the manager refunded us no questions asked.  2. This is not a boutique hotel people, 0
My review is strictly based on the restaurant and food as I never actually made it in the the saloon dance hall area. Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of BBQ and was very excited to try Gilley's for the first time. I was disappointed from the minute I opened the menu. I must have flipped through it front to back and back to front three or four times because I felt like I was just overlooking a section that listed brisket. Sadly I wasn't overlooking anything. Gilley's does not have any type of brisket whatsoever; not even so much as a chopped brisket sandwich. How can a place with a huge neon outline of Texas on the wall with it's original roots in Houston, 0
Sooooo disappointed. Wow. Beautiful view, 0
I had one hour for lunch, 0
If I can give this place a -5 star I would, 0

horrible!!!! do not use them if you own a property!  i'm firing them today for many many reasons!, 0
Nice big TV's and great for watching sports of course. But I was disappointed with the food. The "Beer cheese" that was supposed to come with our pretzels was not beer cheese. It was green chile cheese . (the same exact cheese that came on the nachos.) Also the cheesesteak sandwhich was supposed to be sliced rib eye but when it was was served it was actually just ground beef. So their menu is very misleading. And the waitress was very unfriendly. She seemed like she hated her job so much. I don't expect waiters to act extremely happy all of the time but she was straight up in a bad mood and showing it., 0
Nope! Never again! Disgusting lobby. Perhaps the lazy little girls texting and instagramming could wipe a table or sweep a freaking floor.  And for the love of GOD could ANYONE wear some freaking gloves? Someone call the health department!, 0

Horrible service!!! Bartenders were incredibly rude! One of the mangers came over to talk to us about the service and ended up talking to his employee in front of us. We finished our drinks and the bartender refused to take our bill because he said"we are young and wouldn't tip". We tipped the buser because he was the only one who did a great job! We waited around for another manager to discuss the issues! Do not come here! They do not care about service to their customers!, 0
Been eating out lots and lots and lots lately.   I have had such good luck with Yelp, 0
Terrible equipment. Holes in the matting on the floor. They have a juice bar with advertised open hours but is never open during the posted hours. Front desk staff has a terrible attitude when you ask them when the juice bar will be open.  Apparently there's only one person certified to make the shakes and she's never there., 0

As I've stated before in a previous review I used to come here all the time back in the day.  Zapatas has completely gone downhill and has now reached the classification of all the other # 14 Mexican type restaurants.  This is not sustainable in this area.  There wasn't a wait tonight, 0
Called to find a chair I really liked on their website, 0
I wanted to like this place. Who else is open with happy hour with sushi at 2am when I'm having horrible cravings? But the service was bad. The waiter seemed to be pissed off or something and pretty much took it out on us muttering under his breath and all. It ruined our happy vibes and made us feel awkward. Just a very disappointing first time experience and sadly my last visit., 0
After many great reviews here I had high expectations for Sammy's. I went in at 7 pm on a Thursday and the place was staffed with one hardworking individual - working the kitchen, 0
I am so torn on this location. A lot of the time they have what I'm looking for but sometimes they don't have hardly any selection. I was very disappointed in how I was treated when I came in with my service dog by security. He did not even ask if he was a service dog at all. He just snapped at me that there were no dogs allowed in the store and when I told him he is a service dog he rolled his eyes at me and said nothing else. When I complained to the manager she was. Very rude and pretty much acted like she didn't have time for me at all. She just said "ya ya I'll talk to him. Anything else?" Um yes there is something else. Check the attitude at the door or don't work customer service., 0
It seems every casino must have a steak house and an Italian restaurant.  Continuing the great Las Vegas tradition of uninventiveness and mediocrity, 0
I took a turntable in to.have them adjust the tonearm settings.  They told me it would take a week for an estimate.  A week later I was told it would be another week.  A week later they said they would take three more days. When I stated the constant delays were unacceptable he got extremely angry and told me in a rude tone to pick up my turntable since they had someone die. I started to explain that I was not aware of their situation, 0
The atmosphere here really lost something after the change from Cosmos. It seems very drab and plain. The food is ok at best. In the weekends they turn a small portion of the place into a "dance floor"., 0
The staff put scratches on my engagement ring!!   They insisted on putting my engagement ring on a ring garter, 0
Giving this place one star is quite an achievement for this family owned business. I congratulate them for attempting to try serving people. They are unorganized and and have literally one person working while they entire family is sitting in the back eating lunch. We didn't get a refil til we asked 40 mins after we ate. Two items we ordered were forgotten and we sat in the dinning room looking around instead of eating and enjoying being out. The food was great the only benefit of coming in. Otherwise I would never come back. Ever!!!!!!!!!  Being nice and being efficient in the service is a much. They were only nice., 0
Are there fewer then one stars? What an epic fail. I rent a car with the check engine light on. The agent lies to me and says he adjusted the gas cap and it should fix the light. I learn later there is no gas cap.  Car fails on the freeway. I call the 800 number ... And wait ... And wait. I call the local number. It goes to the 800 number.  I finally restart the car and get to where I am going.  Return to the airport. "Customer Service" counter is open but not staffed. "Hector" says I don't start until 8. It is 7:55. Walk across the garage to the Gold Desk. No manager on duty. Nobody seems to have the authority to do anything--all I am asking for is to waive 1/8 tank refueling charge.   Thanks for nothing., 0
My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant late at night to try the poutine and the smoked meat sandwich.  I was sucked in by all the rave reviews that I felt that there was no alternative to Dunn's for late night poutine.    Needless to say, 0
The one star is for service which was excellent.  It's not their fault that this pizza is nothing more than a slab of cardboard with a paltry dab of sauce and suggestion of cheese.  Flavorless and overpriced.  What a racket., 0
Can I give this place zero stars?! This place should be called the worsten Inn not Westin!  Mgmt has zero consideration for their guest's allowing a loud party with loud music late at night on both Saturday & Sunday! Had to complain twice! Could not sleep on both nights thanks to the loud pounding music coming from beneath our room. What a waste of our $$ staying here. This was the worst stay at a resort ever! Boy were we glad to get the heck out! Mostly deserted, 0
First time ordering. They sent a med instead of the large we ordered and there was a metal piece in the crust of the pizza.  We regularly use the eat24 app and trust what they have on there.  This new place was a total bust!, 0
We were very disappointed with Japonais.  The sushi's quality is just ok and way over priced ($8-$16 for each piece, 0

2.5 Stars  Glendale Glitters in my opinion has run its course.  My family and I have been going to this event for ten years and nothing has changed.  I understand nostalgia but at some point we all need to grow and this event needs to as well!  Surrounding businesses and at least one church that I went to attempted to twist my arm for ten dollars to park in their parking lots.  The city of Glendale needs to ensure visitors are not being gouged to park at this city event.  The city has the same food and merchandise vendors at the Glitters and the Chocolate  Festival.  Allowing an area for some food trucks and maybe representatives from the sporting teams in the city would be a quick injection of exciting change!  Anymore ideas I will start charging a consulting fee.  I sure hope this review makes it to the event planners., 0
Came here for Lunch. Had a reservation. We were seated at the Patio.  Water waiter was very friendly. Our waitress was n t really friendly.  Bread was good.  We both had the brie. Was Cold and Not so good.  Both had Steaks with redwine. We ordered Medium. Was med rare.  Fries were ok. Nothing Special.  Spinach to garlic flawored.  Don't Kiss anybody after this.  View was amaizing.  Service Not good. We got spinach 5 min before the Steaks.  I think its to expensive., 0

Not a favorite Walmart location in town. The parking lot is always packed and I'm constantly dodging pedestrians and other vehicles on my way to finding a spot. The store is not as organized and well-stocked as other Walmarts I've been to. I had a few items I wanted to buy but the lines were so long I ended up just putting all my items back and just walking out. They needed to be more aware of line management and have more registers open to accommodate all the patrons., 0
Anytime the owner is that rude and unprofessional you earn a one star review. Hey Matt, 0
The fries were FREAKING AWESOME!  We got the fries before the burgers so we were totally stoked for the burgers. Insert very sad face :( The burgers were bland and SOOOO greasy. After delicious fries the burgers were so "blech" that we were SERIOUSLY disappointed., 0

Horrible customer service. Place looks old cheap and dirty. We had a large party so we were putting tables together and the guy working there said that if we were going to move the tables that we had to put it back before we left. The guy even had the audacity to come check after we left trying to look all intimidating. Won't be going back ever. In case this helps it was a big guy with bradded hair that was the rude one. We were a large party of paying customers the least we ask for is to have decent customer service., 0

BLT Steak is a very poorly run company. I purchased a BLT steak gift card from corporate BLT . The local restaurant will not honor the 500.00 gift card and tried to double bill me for an diner.

My husband and I went  here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  We had previously been to the one in Goodyear which has since closed so we went up  here .  The atmosphere is not as good as the old restaurant it is basically a regular restaurant that serves greek food.  The food was good however the service was not.  I asked for a glass of water and was half way through my meal when I fially  got it.  Also my husband asked the waitress what the vegetables were and she just said I don't know, 0

What a mess! Over an hour just to park on the road. Inside was a congestion of people among lines of vendor booths and no one to point you to ANY of the food advertised on tv! Settled for expensive burgers/dogs with hot soda cans and chips.  In the store there were lines everywhere and no one helping except behind the counter to get your pastry and money.  Expensive everything and none of the fun shown in an empty farm on tv news!  Wish they would go to show the mess it is with 100's of people trying to have a good time!  We will go North/ South for better run and more fun festivals! Bring stroller/wagon for the long hike back to the car if you have kids. We helped carry bags for a guest so she could carry her hot, 0
This review is for the Take Care Clinic more than the store itself.  a.  The waiting line - 2 star  - I really like the computerized check in system they have here. You can go on line or check in on their computer. It is totally cool, 0
So this was my first time eating at Red Robin ever..... yes I said ever...... I was really excited to see that they had a mushroom burger on their menu! Not a lot of places have mushroom burgers so I was super excited to try it. When our food came out my burger was cooked to my specifications, 0

The displays were very understocked and it was hard to find someone to help me. I needed to purchase about $1000 in camera gear but ended up having to go somewhere else because of lack of stock and service. I'll be avoiding this location in the future. Most Best Buy locations don't have this problem at all. Get it together!, 0
terrible experience - food, 0
I thought I would order from this Lino's because the Linos on Ann road is pretty good.  We ordered 2 pizzas and wings.  It took an hour and 15 minutes for delivery...whatever.  The crust was okay on the pizzas not thin...not thick.   The problem lay within the toppings.  No taste cheese and that rounded fluffy no flavor sausage.  That is the super cheap frozen food section supermarket sausage..... When I order sausage on my pizza I am wanting Italian sausage.  That isn't asking for much is it?  Summary; slow delivery. okay crust, 0

I've been a fan of Verizon since switching from Sprint back in 06 and became a bigger fan since getting my Droid X.     The other day I bought a 16 GB SD card for my Droid and installed it.  I started to experience problems with my phone and decided to stop by my local Verizon store for some help.  The Verizon rep led me to believe that the SD card that I purchased from Best Buy was not compatible with my Droid and proceeded to tell me that Verizon only guaranties Verizon products to work in their phones.  She then tried to sell me a 16 gb card for $69(my card was $35).  I tried to explain to her that SD tech is standardized and a PNY 16 GB Micro SD card is the same thing as the Verizon SanDisk 16 GB Micro SD card that she is trying to sell me.  She looked at my card with a look of disapproval and said "I've never heard of that brand".   She did offer to look for a discount but I declined after sensing a little attitude. I left the store disappointed with my issue unresolved.    After some homework on the internet I found out that I needed to do is reformat my new SD card to get it to work correctly. I know she is a sales person but I didn't go in there to buy something I went in there for the" World-class service and support" that Verizon advertises.  Thank you Verizon., 0
The following review is specifically for the "Bungalow room type"   These rooms are in the attached two story building out by the swimming pool. We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street.   Did not have a secure feeling as it felt like anyone could walk up from the street and have direct access to the sliding glass door. The rooms are all nonsmoking in the Bungalows so the sliding glass door was good for lover boy to go in and out for a smoke. That was the only good thing!   Thank goodness I had my lover Sean with me for protection, 0
HORRIBLE! Go elsewhere. They charged me $7 for a pair of shorts, 0

My husband and I were in town April 9th as a part of a regatta. We wanted a relaxing steak dinner, 0
The place was small. Nowhere for kids to have a good time at a pizza place. It was cheap but because it wasn't from-scratch dough either. It was like going to little Cesar's. It was okay but I was expecting more of an authentic pizza and something a little greater than what we had, 0

Rating on food alone.  Service was great.  Ate the miyagi San burger but my egg was well done and I was looking forward to a runny yolk since there was not really a spread. BUT the crispy onions were great.  Got the calamari but it tasted like raw flour.  I don't think I will come back being that this was my second upset here., 0
I hope this business burns in a thousand flames in the seven hells.  two hour wait time for shuttle at the pick-up point to go to EDC, 0
I am giving this "resort" one star only because Yelp requires at least one star be given. A couple hours into our stay we walked back to our room to find another guest sitting on the steps to our room.  The guest politely asked us which room we are staying in, 0
HELLO! It is a PAWN SHOP No different than any other PAWN SHOP Just maybe more expensive AND  with a LONG LINE OUTSIDE Only go there if you love their show...., 0
I'd heard some positive buzz, 0
Terrible service and empty pans. We have been to this location three times and every time they have empty pans and are understaffed. Never have the apologized for the long wait.  I will not return to this location.. I will stick to the one on Estrella., 0
These outlets still need work, 0
its bad in general. the service is lame. The pianist I think is on speed. No style just plows through it. I called ahead to ask about dinner and wine specials for dinner. Dinner is not happy hour. I was told all about the happy hour specials except that they were for happy hour.  Its just a click joint as my father would say with a new york accent. The worst Cesare salad I ever had. No taste, 0

This place based on what it could be... is a Dud.  Food is so-so.  Salsa is like marinara sauce. They say it is fresh guac, 0
This place is so unbelievably overrated.  Promoters asking ladies to send their photos?  Bizarre dungeonesque stone walls everywhere that make you feel like you're a competitor on Legends of the Hidden Temple but in 5-inch stilettos?  Never mind the fact that it was clearly designed by an architect who was obviously going through a very serious infatuation with stairs.  Even after taking the elevators, 0

Food was GREAT!!! Exactly what we were hoping for! But TERRIBLE SERVICE! Watch out for the red headed butch hair cut woman at the bar... My boyfriend spilled his glass of ice on the bar table... He apologized for it and the woman glared at him then took her hand and SWATTED the ice on the floor!!! VERY RUDE! And VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! It was an accident!!!I'm sorry but it's not just the food that makes a restaurant... It's the staff and the overall experience.  Never coming here again. She left us leaving in a bad mood and I was quite frankly not hungry anymore. I did not finish my plate...it's a shame because I was looking forward to this experience... I come from rochester ny. I work at Wegmans!  One of THE TOP 100 places to work for! Wegmans employees go out of their way EVERYDAY to make sure customers walk out with a smile on their face! No smiles here.... Never again. NEVER! Sorry Guy...., 0

O.k when u go ask for Angela she took real good care of us the first night ... The third day omg it was horrible we had two different waitress to help us  cold coffee refills we had a hair in our food ask to speak to the manager we had to wait until we got the check to find out why the manager was never called a waiter name Terrance came to help us who said he was doing a favor ... Horrible service ..... Never again at this Denny next to casino royale.., 0
First off the tickets are more expensive on the computer then they are when you pay in person but that may not be the theaters fault...we got here early to get our seats and they said that the movie theater was still  showing in our theatre when we asked them how long will it take before the movies over the man responded by saying however long it takes really rude. We were not allowed to go inside to at least sit down in the hallway or something ...they made us go out to the benches which were already full . Also this theater is dirty and smells. Will not be coming here again if I can avoid it., 0
I don't give out many one stars (you have to really fail to get that), 0
I have been here twice while on business on that side of town. First-shortly after they opened, 0
I will not be ordering from this Dominos again. Last week I ordered from here and the pizza took an hour and when we received it it was lukewarm at best. Tonight when I ordered from here they told me they couldn't take my credit card because their machines were down. Strike three and they are out., 0
First off they say they open at 11..the cook was late so they ended up opening at 1120. Second my croaker I ordered tasted terrible like it was old fish. The lady at the front register has a terrible attitude and is not friendly at all. Won't return food is greasy and it taste like its fried in old oil., 0
I am so DISAPPOINTED on Miller's Las Vegas Ale House (http://www.facebook.com/lasvegasalehouse)   How come in a shopping area where upscale Lounges and Restaurants like Double Helix (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Double-Helix-Wine-Bar-and-Retail-Shop/196762299176) and Brio (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brio-Tuscan-Grille/150484198302822) accepts Dogs in their patio area you don't!!!!!??????.

My first and only 1 star review, 0
Les 3 Brasseurs is a pretty average restaurant.  The food's alright, 0
DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!  Called in an order. They said it would be about 45 minutes. About 5 minutes after we had originally called we called back to let them know we'd like to pick-up the order rather than have it delivered (decided to run errands rather than be lazy pizza eating fattys). "No problem, 0
Easily the worst food I've have had the displeasure of tasting in a very long time. The dining room is old, 0
The best part of the night was the outdoor seating and the friendly table sitting next to us.   We had a groupon to try out Luma and at this point we probably won't go back.  It seems that the kitchen might have been having an off night because the other table also had issue with the cooking of the food (sent their dish back twice which we also had to do)  What we sampled:   Bread (decent bread, 0

Happy hour menu has changed for the worse. All good things must come to an end although still a decent happy hour., 0
We ordered from this place because we were in the mood for some Italian and heard good things about them. We weren't sure if we were out of their range so we called to ask. The guy on the phone was rude right off the bat. I've been in the food business and knew that during lunch time things can get hectic but starting off with a negative attitude is never a good start on the phone. We asked if we were in their range and he said yes. We ordered the food and he neglected to tell us how long it would take. After about 30 minutes I called to ask how long and he rudely says he told me 45 minutes. I don't recall it but still no reason to be rude. After an hour and 20 mins passes I called again and he tells me 'look, 0
Wings were delicious. I would have rated the wings alone 5 stars if they didn't cost $20.  The pizza was delicious, 0

Ok so given these are all people from out of town who wrote reviews on this place. Let me talk to you about the Tattoo culture. The artists here aren't bad. This is however a tourist trap. They don't even schedule tattoos right. Plus they don't quote you right. They have ripped people off. 200 dollars to get small lettering that took 45 min? Are you kidding me. Yea it got popular because of the show. But seriously. For people who really are into tattoos. This is just a trendy hodge podge of people who rip people off. Do you think they use the best and brightest inks? What did they tell you put lotion on it. It'll look good when it's healed. Don't pick it. Yea their tattoos are pretty good. Most of the time. But you're also looking in books. Anyone can trace or color by number. Well mostly anyone. Seriously save your money. Go somewhere where they will care and talk you out of stupid mistakes. Research your tattoo before you do something stupid and regret it., 0
Stayed there Dec 23-25 23rd - 2.5 hr wait for dinner, 0
First time here for late-night dinner. The food was slightly cold and the waiter told me to heat it up in the microwave.  Service was slow, 0
Sandwich with a side of pretension? No, 0
I found my experience here underwhelming.  We ordered some sangria pitchers to get the night going but it was weak (almost like juice with a few drops of alcohol added).   The service was really bad.   There were large delays to get food and when it finally did arrive not everyone got what they ordered all at the same time (or within a reasonable amount of time).  Some had to wait a lot longer than others to get their tapas.  The food itself was decent., 0
This is not good Asian food.  The veggie stir fry was terrible.  The rice was deplorable.  The hot and sour soup was very good - a bright spot on the menu.  If I was ever forced to come here again, 0
This place was the most horrible pizza hut I have ever been to. First there was no one to greet anyone when I walked in, 0
I too was really looking forward to trying this place out. I live in Vegas and we are alway looking for good Burger places here. My husband and I do not smoke and agree with the other comments that having to walk through a smoke filled room to go eat is not pleasant. Line was long. About 35 minutes to sit down. It's very bright and noisy inside. Prices are reasoable but food was really boring. I had a Patty Melt and discovered there was only a thin piece of hamburger patty on one side of sandwhich. Other side had Nadda! I hated the fries. Fried shoe string potatoes tasted like chips. I also had a Mocha Chocolate shake which had a chemical-type after taste. yuck! I won't be back. I think I'll stick to Red Robin or Chile's or even In-N-Out next time., 0
I signed up for this gym because of the price...and that's what you get.  A $10 gym membership = only 10% worthwhile experience.  They have about 7 total ellipticals and maybe 20 treadmills.  Every single time I went in there at least 4 of the ellipticals weren't working and there were at least 5 treadmills that were either stuck in the "up" position, 0
Chef went to Jail. Restauranr out of business., 0
not impressed. Ive eaten a lot of pizza in my time and DiVitos ranks a level or two above frozen. The sauce was bland, 0
Even one star is too much. I went to the buffet on the second floor. Food was bad. Potstickers were torn, 0
Diluted Mexican cuisine.  Nothing "hot" about the hot sauces- either green or red.  The half of a cup of watery salsa was inadequate  to mask the flavor of the greasy if plentiful tortilla chips (for which no plates or napkins were offered).    The chili relleno and frijoles were the blandest I have ever eaten outside of a chain restaurant's drive-through. The television blared a raucous Mexican talk show to an empty dining room.  Loud, 0

Long story short...I have been taking my Avalanche to Freeway since I bought it from them in 2003.  Things started feeling fishy when I was told I needed new brakes.  I got a second opinion at a brake shop and they told me my brakes were just fine (they actually lasted another year)!  Just took my truck in and was given a $3400 estimate for repairs!  Ouch!  Took it to an reputable mechanic and was charged $934 for THE SAME WORK!  Freeway Chevrolet has lost a previously very loyal customer and I will make SURE everyone I know knows about how they conduct business!  Oh...the staff IS very friendly...if they are successfully fleecing their customers like they tried to me...they can afford to be!, 0
We went there because the Weekly magazine listed this place as a must go to place for breakfast. We ordered pancake, 0

This is the worst car rental company ever. Not only is the Las Vegas airport  location crooked but so is the corporate office. I had a prepaid reservation booked months in advance. When I arrived to pick up the car I informed them that the credit card that I used to pay for the reservation had been cancelled due to fraudulent activity and they issued me a new card which I presented to them. I was informed that because I did not have the original card that the reservation is not valid. Even though they had full payment on the rental paid months earlier and the replacement card issued by the credit card company for security they would not honor my reservation.They would however make a new reservation as a "walk up" at double the rate I had already Paid! I told them I was not willing to pay double and they informed me the rate was non negotiable. Duke A. the manager was very rude and said he was going to call security if I did not leave the counter while I was trying to reach the corporate office via my cell phone. I contacted the corporate office and they are as crooked as this location. They are not willing to refund my money that the charged to my credit card (it was paid in full). What kind of company can get away with not honoring your pre-paid reservation and then no give you your money back when you refuse to pay double ! In this day and age with the amount of credit card that goes on this is not an isolated incident. Instead of having a little compassion they try to bend you over and charge you double., 0
This place wins the award for...........worst bacon EVER!!! I mean the worst! It's basically like when you are cooking bacon and mess up so badly you throw it out, 0

I went to Yoli's yesterday for the first time and boy what a bad experience, 0

It was our annual girls trip to Vegas. We were hoping to see Wayne Brady but he was on vacation and the sales people at Tix4 Tonight recommended Blue Man Group.  Had I been 30 years younger I may have enjoyed it better.  Even at half price of $60 per ticket I feel we were ripped off.  Music was waaaay to LOUD and skits were ok.  A lot of spewing paint from mouths, 0
The last time I came here and got a breakfast, 0
Let me preface this with the crucial fact that I have not yet been to Hakkasan. But let me follow with two words that explain this 1 star rating: customer service.   Everyone working in this industry should know and value the importance of customer service, 0
Stop yourself right now. Walk away quickly.  Man, 0
The rooms are normal. Furniture needs an upgrade. No closet but 1 armoire. Nice LCD TV with low def picture. Serious? Wired internet which we could not find in the room. Walls are paper thin. You definitely could hear your neighbors and people in the hall. Our bed must have backed up to neighbor's bathroom as every morning we were awaken by their shower. $20 resort fee plus tax on the resort fee.   Positives: gym was nice, 0

I promise this will be my final review on Al's.  My last review commended them on their Beef sandwich....ok...so heres the thing... If you get there at the right time of the day (when they open when everything is fresh and the beef hasent been sitting in hot water all day) you get a good beef sandwich(as long as you add the peppers for taste..which btw they charge you for), 0
Really?! Adding potatoes to canned corned beef hash does not make it 'homemade" as menu states. Very deceitful. And also, 0

When a customer ask for napkins it is possible they need more than the two you so kindly reminded me were in my bag. (Rude). It just so happens that YOU over filled my drink and it spilled.

There was a large group of us visiting Vegas for a bachelor party and the groom wanted pizza so we attempted to try Metro. We had to take multiple cabs to get out group there. We arrived 10 minutes before closing and the hostess (who was still manning the front door) notified us that they were closed. I pointed out that we were their before their posted closing time and that we were planning on giving them some substantial patronage. She started to seat us when a cook literally ran up to the front to put the kabosh on that. He said he was, 0

it was the worst customer service experience of my life in a hotel.  i have complained and called several times and it is falling on deaf ears. your company does not care about customers at all.  your lack of follow up is disgusting.  i hope that hotel goes out of business and all of those terrible people that work there get fired.  FRONT DESK DOES NOT CARE AND NEITHER DOES CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Room was dirty.  i actually prepaid for 3 nights and checked out after the first night and stayed somewhere else.  I read some of the more positive yelp reviews and found them to be incorrect., 0

I have lived here for about a year now. The management sucks and the people in the leasing office clearly have no idea what they are doing. The employees are rude and disrespectful to the tenants and they try to find ways to screw you out of more money. I have been working on moving out, 0
Most definitely a hole-in-the-wall neighborhood bar. Decor is very much dated, 0
This was by far the worst cold stone creamery I've ever been too. They appear to be understaffed and not prepared. There was a line full of people. The place was disgusting. Floors and counters looked sticky. One of the employees appeared to be new while the other was overwhelmed and incompetent. Can't believe it took about 45 mins to get an order for my husband, 0
There is alot going on here, 0
I've been going to TGIF since they opened but on 9/26/2013something real bad happened .It was a real bad night in more ways then one, 0

I cannot believe that this place has so many 5 start reviews.  I tried this because every review was glowing about this place and thought this just might be one of those truly hidden gems.  So imagine my complete disappointment after eating here.   The concept is pretty cool actually.  They just bring you food until you tell them to stop.  Some food is warming in chaffing dishes and others are being freshly prepared by the owner.  The chicken/chili soup was decent, 0
Not a fan of this location. The food was subpar each time I've been., 0
I have been here 3 times and 3 times I've had to wait way longer than they quoted to get a service.  The technicians don't like their jobs and you usually get to here about it.  They are also SO SLOW.  Everything takes forever!  And talk about unprofessional.  No, 0

On each of the three occasions I went to this office to see the doctor I had to wait a minimum of 45 minutes past my appointment time to see him. On the other occasion that I went in for an allergy test the staff forgot about me in the back room. They were not considerate with my time and the fact that I was taking off time from work to be there and had to get back. I came in with a boring case of allergies, 0
My husband wanted to try the beef.... it was awful. Tasted like what might be [soft rubbery] vegan meat? Wont be going there again. The place was clean, 0
Staff were more concerned about carrying on their conversations than waiting on their customers.  The food was okay but the kitchen is very slow. Everyone here needs training an attitude adjustment and management. Too bad., 0
Two bucks to send a fax.  And 22 cents per page to print a simple two-sided b/w text manuscript?!  Plus the staff go out of their way not to look at you.  Next time I'll take Garrett's advice and only visit in an emergency., 0
Stopped in Sunday Morning to check out.  Service was very slow and all food taste like it was cooked in the same bacon grease. Waited forever for our food and it was horrible. First and last time for this place !!!!!!!, 0
I expected to be impressed by this restaurant. Not so, 0
Okay even with Groupon giving 60% off you still have to spend $200 to use the $100 certificate that cost $40 so we wound up spending  $175 with tip for 3 of us and the food was nasty! The service was awful Texas de Brazille is much better this was no bargain it was the cheapest cuts of meat and for the first time I agree with most of the critics on here!  Waste of money! avoid!, 0
style:substance ratio here is not what I prefer.  food is pretty average and overpriced - they try hard on the presentation, 0
Good grief!  I thought not being able to park here for over 7 days was my problem... now I realize that simply PARKING here is my problem.  I tried to be green by buying a bus ticket on the Van Galder to get me to Chicago.  Silly me. I drove here to catch my bus on a Friday around 10am only to find the lot completely full with cars -- folks were even double-parked in no-parking areas.  Unable to park my car, 0
I used a groupon and placed a call in order. Got there and they didn't put the bread in with the pasta.  Waited for that. Then  I realized they didn't put the meatballs in the pasta. Waited again. Finally after 1 hr and 10 minutes it was done. Had my kids with me too. Unacceptable service! This is how restaurants lose customers. They didn't offer to deduct anything off the bill for screwing up the order either., 0
No. No. No. Asian food is blan or just a bunch of soy sauce.. They charge for hot sauce.. they charge for salsa refill and chips.. not worth it. Epic fail. Found hair in our complimentary wontons that we got because our food was late. Fyi. Seating in the outside by the entrance is uncomfortable, 0
Not too impressed. When I called to ask for the nearest parking garage the hostess didn't know and directed me to one almost a mile away when there was one around the corner. Second, 0
No way we are ever coming back!! When I saw all of the great reviews I thought this was a no brainer.  I was wrong. I have a 10  month old Maltipoo male. I had asked for a trim and his nails cut, 0

My wife took me there for my birthday.  Service was horrible!  We had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter to acknowledge us and a total of 40 minutes before we received our salad and soup.  The manager was just as poor as the waiter.  They both gave us different stories for the delays.  Will NEVER eat there again.  Food was average., 0

Not Impressed at ALL!!!  Had to wait nearly 45 minutes when we were told the wait was 20 minutes.  I really didnt enjoy standing in the middle of the parking lot waiting for my table!  When we were finally seated I felt right at home because our table was also in the parking lot! LOL! I planned on ordering the eggplant lasagna - until my friend pointed out it took 45 minutes to cook - no thanks.  I want outta here quick.  Instead I ordered the Lady is a Scampi - I will describe it as strange.  My friend ordered a pasta dish also and a side order of the Giant Meatball.  When the "Giant Meatball" came out it wasnt giant it was all cut up in the sauce - aka meat sauce.  One good thing was the food came out quick so once we were finally seated we were outta there quick.  I wont be back., 0
Played here on 3/12/13. I was very disappointed in the condition of the course as well as the noise as they were still taking down the stands from the tourney.  1st off, 0
First thing I want to say is that I tried to post a review on their site, 0
It started good..then went downhill. The massages were mediocre. I booked online for a male masseuse and got a female instead. I was told they had only 1 male masseuse and he was on-call. After massages and my very quick 20 minute hydrotherapy bath ( which advertise longer)...I went to relax by the lap pool where I witnessed the staff cater to everyone else but me & my mom. We sat out for an hour and no one checked on us. Didn't ask if we wanted anything or if we were ok. They brought out the other women drinks and food menus. I didn't even know they had a food menu. When I checked out, 0
Don't come here.  The service was terrible.  It took 15 minutes just to get water and the portions are non existent....., 0
The toong tong was a decent appetizer and the pad ke-mao was a good entree, 0
Very bad service. I have friends that work in the Mirage & everyone knows this place is expensive (& they charge $3 if you share). I don't mind paying for great food & service, 0
Pure crap. You're better off eating grass at the curb. All the food is full of MSG, 0
OMG!  Why? Why? Why? Did I not look at the Yelp reviews?    DON'T DO IT! Just DON'T. I don't care how much money you think you are saving.  Here is our story.  First, 0
Caffe Boa used to have the best happy hour on Mill. Looks like they decided to fall into rank and increase some prices over 50%. Might be small peanuts to the bottom line, 0
Stayed here with my family on a quick 2 day vacation.  We were looking forward to experiencing Old Vegas but did not have such a great experience.  We paid extra to guarantee a NON Smoking room.  Got to room after winding through dimly lit halls to find out Non Smoking room to be very smokey.  Called front desk to have room changed, 0
I would like to add no stars, 0
If you're looking for customer service you won't find it here. It's a shame since they do carry a decent product and have added Kristin Cavallari to the selection. Management is horrible. Probably the most ghetto experience I've had in a store. If you are looking to shop at this store, 0
Staff are really friendly, 0
We were looking forward to a nice quiet dinner with friends.  Well it was very quiet.  We arrived at 6:15 PM on a Wednesday the place was empty and it was pretty empty when we left at 8:40 too.  There was a bit of a communication issue with the waiter when we were ordering drinks but that got resolved fairly quickly.  Once we did get our drinks the waiter asked if we would like to order.  We told him we need a bit to relax, 0
Fuk the Asian/Hawaiian guestlist guy with the beard, 0
TRASH.   I can't tell you about the bartenders. But I can let you know the door man and some other bounces are not pleasant.   I've been here a few times. It compares to Dandelion but about 10 times trashier with staff who don't really care about there customers., 0
Ok food but the service suks rotten eggs. Huge Fail., 0
I was in vegas about 2 weeks ago and I still miss it...BUT I would never go to this club again. The girls and I came here the day Kim K was having her bachelorette party. It was superrrrrr crowded. Even though we had "vip" we still had to wait about 20 min to get in. The music also sucked!!! They played "Birthday Sex" twice in a hour. They also played a bunch of old pop and hip hop. I prefer dance music, 0
I don't why this hotel is rated high. It's a Pathetic restaurant . Actually I am right now in the restaurant. They have a buffet lunch. Once I took the curries I was told I will get the naan but I had to wait 30mins until I went and ask for it again. Atmosphere sucks. I would better have gone to some gas station and got Pringles., 0
This is only in reference to the veggie burrito:  Stick with the meats.  The Veggie burrito costs more than the fish and equal to the other meats (wha???), 0
No one in my home was happy with your professional and customer service.  After contacting living social and stating this, 0
So they sent me a note tell me they would investigate. Nothing ever happened!!! FU New Star bad food restaurant....., 0
Food wasn't that great the bread was the best part of my meal. Try one of the other 10 restaurants in the area to avoid disappointment., 0
The Jerry's on Thomas used to have good food but over the last few months something has changed.  If one meal were bad, 0
absolutly nasty. the chicken parm was gross. tasted like canned sauce. supposedly you get 2 free kids meals with purchase of one adult entree. even though I did not eat my chicken parm I was still charged for it and the 3 childrens items ordered. The manager questioned me on the food and I told him that i have had much better, 0
Yelp steered us here for brunch, 0
I don't understand the line to get into this place.  The food is mediocre at best.  The prices are a bit high for what they are.  However the portions are huge.    The wait staff was great and my Margarita was excellent.  I may make it back to the bar but I will skip the restaurant., 0
they try I guess, 0
I planned a 40th birthday Vegas trip for a friend of mine and we planned on going to see Calvin Harris at Hakkasan on Sat. night. I worked with a VIP host to get a reservation for a table for 10 people (5 couples).  He told me to arrive early, 0
Well my wife and I booked this hotel expecting something great but we were so wrong. Other then the great food we had at the cafe, 0
I had high hopes for this place.  The menu looks great, 0
I had high expectations stepping into the buffet line. It's the "Wynn buffet" you really can't expect any less right?   Food:  By far the most disappointing part of the meal. There is quite a bit of variety but not as much as the other big named buffets in Vegas. The food was surprisingly disappointing...I tried every fish dish they had to offer (totaling 5) and only enjoyed one of them. The crab legs were not fresh. The sushi was made incorrectly (rice was a mush texture). The lamb dishes were okay. The prime rib was decent but heck how can you really mess that up?    Service:  Well its a buffet so you wouldn't really expect much service. The waitress took quite a while to get us drinks. She was just not that friendly overall.  Environment:  This place looks like a $50 per head restaurant. And maybe that's why I expected much more than they provided. The design ranging from plating in the buffet line to table decor is probably the best I've seen at a buffet.   Price:  Expect to spend around $40 for dinner. My recommendation? Take that $40 and eat somewhere with solidly decent food. If not make a quick cab ride to the Rio buffet.   Food: 2 Service: 3 Environment: 4 Price: 2, 0
I was craving noodles and this was the closest fast food joint that carried anything close to noodles. Plus I needed to carb load for an upcoming race.  Admittingly, 0
Nada que ver los tacos de asada muy malos y barbacoa pura grasa lo \u00fanico bueno fueron las tortillas todo lo dem\u00e1s no est\u00e1 bueno yo no lo recomiendo, 0
Do not stay here! The room was so disgusting that I could not even spend the night. There were stains all over the carpet, 0
Where do I even start with this place??? My husband and I went to the courthouse to get our marriage license, 0
I would rather spend the night lodged in a dumpster in the heart of south central with 2 black gentlemen having their way with me.., 0
Eck.  Came in at 12:30pm and they were out of the dish I wanted and those that they had were old. The rice was crunchy in my teeth cuz it was old. Employees were very helpful and fast though., 0
No help at all. Does not listen. Kept waving a wooden model of a foot at me. Told me I have arthritis when, 0
Staff sucks! Dislike this store alot. Long lines. Unhelpful staff! I prefer oreilys!, 0
Worst food ever! I eat mexican all the time and this was the most disappointing meal. 5 of us all had the most basic plain food.    The margarita had barely any liquor in it. The steak was so bland.  A complete waste of $!, 0
I'm Vegan and Mr. Lucky's was one of the few places I read about that I could eat at in Vegas. This place is two streets south of the strip but because of construction, 0
By far the worst sushi restaurant in town. I have been there 3 times, 0
This hotel is probably side by side just as bad as Circus Circus and Stratosphere. It is close than both those hotels as far as the strip is concerned but they are both far from all the action. There is not much going in or around the Casino as far as gambling or young activity so unless your like 70+ and your boring.  The hotel rooms itself are ok and if you are on a budget than you have to do what you have to do right?  The good to this place is that there is a good cheesesteak place and the wynn is only walking distance from the hotel so you can always have fun at the Wynn or Encore but you are not staying there.  Ive experience better....., 0
I used to shop at this store on a daily basis however, 0
Service was slow and the bagel sandwhiches were lacking.  Plus they did not have any of the special that they were advertising., 0

We were so excited to come here because the one in LA is really good and had pretty good reviews on here. But we were sorely disappointed in the customer service and AYCE policy.  The food tasted okay for the most part though.   It is located in a plaza in Chinatown, 0
It isn't that the food wasn't tasty or the service wasn't good, 0

I must preface this review by saying that I did not actually eat here. They would not let me.   I had reservations for two at 6 pm. Our flight arrived in Vegas at 3:30. My friend, 0
With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry. The place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place 2 stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas., 0
I'm being generous and giving this location two stars even though it probably only deserves one.   It's one of the two Vons that inexplicably sandwich UNLV. As another reviewer noted, 0
I had the frozen microwave flatbed bread chicken sandwich my buddy Darnell had the south west steak burrito   The frozen microwave chicken was not very good  Nor was the frozen microwave steak and egg burrito, 0
Cold and stale fries. Got the "modern dog" which is essentially a Chicago style hot dog. It wasn't clear whether they had bothered to heat it up or cook the hot dog as it was room temperature. Terrible terrible food., 0
Flying into this airport is fine - but get there SUPER early if you're flying out.   We were flying Southwest from Las Vegas to Milwaukee, 0
The broth lacks character and flavor, 0
Monta ramen on spring mountain is by far the best ramen in town and I was excited to see that they have expanded. My favorite part about monta was that the menu was short and each dish was made with the highest quality and taste. With that being said I decided to make a stop to the new branch and I noticed they had added a few more items to the menu so I decided to try the pork bun. The pork was dry, 0
Do not like it after remodeling.  Looks like someone's living room, 0
Came to grub on some sandwiches and they are out of pickles and literately out of bread. Who the hell runs out of white bread and sourdough and wheat bread. That's an essential part of making a sandwich. Will not come back!, 0
Meh... It's really dark so it makes me suspicious of the food. I remember liking this place... but perhaps I was just drunk. Went there today with some friends to eat dinner and shoot some darts. No flights on any of the darts... so bring your own. The food was too greasy, 0
The pawn shop just has a bunch of crap and the staff is rude and stupid. It is not nearly ad interesting as it is on tv, 0
I found a DEAD fly in my salad coated in dressing. The server didn't charge me at least but oh my goodness. I will Not be returning, 0
Unfortunately this Walgreens, 0
Everything was bad. Room was really dirty, 0
There's only  so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes.  The unifying theme is weak at best, 0
Decent and good live music until they served my husband's food cold and my salmon piping hot, 0
I went out to lunch here with some friends today. I have to agree with some of the previous ratings and say that this place has zero value. I got the Combo #1 (one of each of the three kinds of tacos).  My big complaint is what you get for what you pay. The combo was like 8 bucks, 0
Worst Cirque show I've ever seen.  The fishbowl act that comes first and is featured on all the posters is the best part of the show.  Everything else was a bore.  All the other acts seem like  the performer wasn't good enough for regular cirque.   But, 0

I have been going to Phoenicia grill for almost 2 years. It was pretty good tasteful food in the beginning. Decent prices. I remember friendly service and gesture of getting 25% off coupon for next trip. Beef kafta were great and they would even give free lentil soup while you wait for take out orders. Those days are gone.  Couple of weeks ago tried to redeem a coupon but was told restrictions apply. Today ordered two combo plates and a gyro. Looks like beef kafta got shrink to kids size meal. Chicken skewer had 3 tiny pieces and hardly anything else. Looks like they split old days meal into two and selling it as two meals. I know people should loose weight but change in portion side is pretty sudden. You can definitely get better food at zk grill for much better price points. Another great option is Rania which has so much better quality food. Bye bye Phoenicia grill..., 0
I USED TO take both my cars here for washes, 0
Horrible service. Drive-thru took more than 15 mins. They have a 2 famous stars for 4 and have ordered several times with cheese. They basically charge the cheese on top. This time the person taking the order wants to charge full price instead of 4 bucks plus extra for cheese. To top it off, 0

The owners are just flat out rude in this store. I think there was only one time they actually said thank you when the person finished ringing me up. The owner (caucasian) married to an asian woman not sure what specific type of asian she is but she is just so rude as well. She won't ever say thank you to you, 0
Maybe I was just unlucky on my visit, 0
Small portion.... High price.., 0
Had to wait for table. Kind of expected due to lunch rush.1pm.  I noticed manager and another employee sitting at a table eating even with a line of 6 people waiting to order. I asked for sweet fire chicken received surf & turf., 0
Eeww is all I could think of as I walked the halls of this school for a tour. Most of the classrooms did not have windows. All rooms were dark and dingy. The floors were dirty and the carpet old. The entire school was very quite and did not hear the normal chatter from little children. Not even from Pre-Schoolers. The playground for pre-schooers is a joke. Completely walled up.   The school might perform academically but I think at a high cost of the childs other development including social skills and physical development, 0
It took over 45 minutes for the food to come out.  I ordered the chicken fried chicken.  The chicken was so rubbery and the crust was soggy.  My eggs were over done and the toast was burnt. Will never go there again for breakfast., 0
Called Troy to provide and install a back yard gate. He responded quickly and came out right away to take measurements and provide an estimate. I never received my estimate and when I asked if he had another job that was delaying him I received no response. Seemed like a nice guy but no follow through and I am still looking for a back gate., 0
Worst manicure ever!  She filed the gel off of my nails so roughly they burned.  I don't like my cuticles cut and after telling the nail tech this she attempted to cut them anyway.  No massage, 0
DO NOT COME HERE. This place does not know how to treat money spending VIPs. Their security staff, 0
This place stinks. The waitress acted like she had better things to do, 0
Have again: the Philly sandwich was actually not bad because the bun was delicious and the meat/onions was good. Not have again: the bacon/cheese fries were marred because of the cheese, 0
Loved the beer selection at TODD ENGLISH PUB. They have maybe 50 craft and rare imports on tap. But holy crap, 0
Don't waste your time... Ick! It's already dry enough in Arizona, 0
I made the reservation and noted it's for the 7 star player's birthday. But the whole service was poor and fell below my fair experiences here in the past and upset my first-timer guest.  The hostess is new and never wore a smile on her face, 0
The appetizers and the staff were probably the only good part about this place.   The wife and I went for the first time.. and the last.   Their signature "Pasta Tagliani" was incredibly bland and waaaaay overcooked on the chicken.   Being someone that cooks Italian food and has a love for the culture that comes with it, 0
Why I wound up staying here aside (valet lost our car keys!), 0
Thai Orchid is an OK Thai restaurant.  The lunch specials are moderately priced and small enough for you to not want to take a nap right after eating.  I mainly get the Pad Thai when I visit because it's usually the 1 out of 4 dishes I recognize on the menu.  I've had better, 0
My husband heard good reviews from a business associate so we decided to  try Switch's Brunch.  My first impression of the actual restaurant was "bar like, 0

I originally wanted to rate this 3 stars as this hotel definitely doesn't deserve any more, 0
My wife and I had dinner at this place last night. we ordered the veggie pizza and the vegan penne pasta with vegetables. Pizza was okay but the pasta was terrible. It was loaded with salt and we needed a microscope to see the vegetables. In other words, 0

Drinks and appetizers are good. But if you like raw chicken for dinner then your crazy., 0
I think the only thing this hotel has going for it is it's location. That would be the only perk to forking out the serious $$$ to stay at this mediocre hotel.   Don't get me wrong, 0
Was not very impressed by this restaurant.   Starting out the atmosphere was nice and we were seated outside which was lovely.   I ordered the Aegean chicken and was not impressed. The sauce that came with it almost reminded me of the cheese from Kraft macaroni and cheese. Not very tasty.  My friends both had the gyro and both were very pleased with this dish.   Service was average. Our plates never got cleared when we were finished eating.   I would try this place again to see if it was just a bad night and sample something different from the menu., 0

Horrible service.  I went there Thursday during happy hour and it wasn't even busy.  Once we were seated we had a chance to look at the menu.  However, 0
I'm writing this review after what started off as a good experience turned incredibly lack luster.  I took my friend here last night for her b-day and wanted some grub and good craft beers. It was a busy Saturday night with a wait, 0
Foods good and the service sucks!, 0
Little Darlings = FAIL  Heard this place could be a great fun spot for couples & has VIP booths with Hookah's but I guess I'll never REALLY know.  - Called & spoke to Hostess to set up a VIP Booth Package which includes Limo Pick up  - Limo driver called to confirm pick up time (12am)  - Limo driver called 45 min late & apologized he is running behind but he is on his way.  - Hour 1/2 Later Limo driver yet again apologizes and offer's discount on package  - 2 HOURS later.. almost 2am, 0
Just stopped in for "Express Lunch"...never again.  From the hostess to the bartender to the waitresses, 0
This is the most difficult gas station to maneuver in.  If the arrows are followed this in only one way in and one way out.  Sadly not everyone follows the arrows, 0
Talk about a lame chain of a resturant! Just because you slap on a home town heroe's name on the front of a building does not mean you should ever go there.   The food is terrible and expensive - bad combination. Bartenders poor mad weak, 0
The dinners was "okay" at best.   Go just for the dessert - Banana Cream Pie...yummy!, 0
No regard for customer service, 0
The two stars are for the food. We shared a bleu cheese burger and the wedge salad along with the potato chip appetizer.  While I do think it would be difficult to mess up said items, 0

Came here tonight. Figured I better get my butt home and write this before I felt totally uninspired to do so.   Love the concept but they just fail in the execution. The decor is just ridiculous. It's like a malt shop meets the farm. I just think that they could have done SO many more inventive things. It's a shame actually.   We ordered two drinks and then looked over the menu for food. Our server was nice but she had another two top and a six top and I think she was a bit overwhelmed. She came back about 10 minutes later no drinks in hand but ready to take our order.   We both ordered the Kobe with no cheese and mayo. An order of the truffle fries.   About five minutes goes by and someone drops off our truffle fries but still no drinks. A few minutes later our food comes out and still no drinks. At this point I had to ask for them which is just ridiculous.  I ordered a $10 glass of wine and I seriously asked if the pour was right on it. It was tiny!   The fries had come out cold but they were still decent. Not the best I've has but ok. The burgers were nothing special. They weren't bad but they weren't spectacular either.   I think Fox missed the mark on this one. It's too bad! Save $40 and have a Five Guys burger!, 0

Poor service and food was disappointing.  Plus the bathrooms are cleaner at mcdonalds. Seriously...it was disgusting. One (of the two) sinks was missing the handles. Classy., 0
We came here last night 5/10. Paid relatively huge amount for this so we were expecting a spectacular show. I came out disappointed. We were advised to seat after the 8th row since we were told there will be fire but there were only one scene with it and didn't even last long.   Now that I am reading other reviews, 0
went for a cleaning on Dec. 18 2013. This was my second visit.  The first cleaning was mediocre but they were easy to get an appointment with so I went again.  The suggested a "deep cleaning" which sounded good (and it was a good cleaning). They double checked with my insurance to make sure I would be covered and it wouldn't cost me anything. They said it was completely covered by my insurance and it wouldn't cost me anything extra.   I just got a bill from the insurance.  They charged $896 for the cleaning!  With insurance covering $684.80 of it. After calling them to inquire about the charge, 0

Most of the negative reviews here are pretty accurate. However a lot of the people writing them are contradicting themselves. It makes no sense that people are complaining that they had to wait in line too long, 0

DO NOT VISIT THIS STORE!  I was lured into this store by a sales woman offering a free sample.  I was then offered a product demo which I accepted.  I was impressed by the immediate results of the product and did decide to purchase.  I was highly pressured to continue to buy more and more (the sales person - Josh) wouldn't let up.  I left the store feeling very uncomfortable and uneasy about the experience.  I decided to return the products and was then told of their NO REFUND POLICY.  This was an hour after I left the store!  I was told I'd have to contact customer service and fill out a refund request form, 0
it saddens my heart to type this review!!!  sorry lo lo's but the truth needs to be told.  my family of 8 adults and 2 children arrived at the restaurant at 1:30 pm on 1/2/13.  we were told the wait was going to be 25 minutes.  we didn't mind because we have always had an awesome experience in the past.  well, 0
I read about all the shows available in Vegas before deciding on this one, 0
Opportunities: Reduce the price of a side of pancakes if the customer doesn't want toast. Even if its only fifty cents.  Better tasting bacon please.   Male server in the morning could be warmer and more sociable.  Probably wont return., 0

Does anyone ever win their drawing?   When walking into Mermaids you are offered some wannabe Mardi Gras beads and a ticket to win money in a drawing. Does anyone win? Probably not, 0
Giving one star is a bit too generous.  This company is a gouging machine.  Fees go up up up up and up some more.  Sky is the limit with Cox. Have been with company 30 + years.  In last three years my rates jumped over 50%. Nice reward for loyalty, 0
It was fine. The food was OK but I've certainly had better and fresher Thai food elsewhere. I would not go back., 0
Possible to leave zero stars?  I did not receive good customer service at this location.  Could either be because since it is downtown, 0
I had a similar experience to the previous reviewer on this store.   When I moved here from Michigan, 0
The hot roast beef was good. The price was cheap but so was the service. After seated we waited five minutes and when the the waiter greeted us he said, 0
I've tried this place several times. Each time hoping that it will taste better. Each time it gets worse. It seems like they re heat leftovers. Nothing is made to order. I had the runs after my last meal. And Everytime my bill somehow becomes more expensive! At first it was around 20 then it somehow ended up being 35 and so on! Weird. You don't get a receipt so it's strange. The owners are sweet like everyone else is saying but the food needs to be FRESH not leftovers. If they cooked enough for lunch then again for the dinner that woud be better. Also the cakes and pies have always been stale. You don't want to eat refrigerated cakes and pies, 0
It's ok for what it is. The quality of food is good but the flavors don't really do it for me.  I think they put cinnamon or something in the fried rice. I've tried maybe 6 dishes and haven't found anything I loved or would order again. :(, 0
Update:  It is scheduled to reopen with different owners on Feb. 2, 0
I will say that word "grocery" is a tad misleading.  There is food to buy, 0
If I could avoid giving them a star i would. it's gross. Their rooms smell like smoke. The fan in the room wasn't turned on like it normally would be at an inn but that's not a problem. I understand and thank you for saving electricity. In the morning I woke up and was excited for my continental breakfast that was *going* to consist of a waffle but the waffle was SOUR. ugh. gross. I mean seriously isn't it just water and pancake mix? We left and went to McDs. I don't even eat that crap but I hadn't a choice., 0
The offices fees were too expensive, 0
I would not eat here again. Staff not friendly. Not helpful. Small scoop of rice and small portion of chow mein.   Avoid this place. Portions are extremely small. Better off eating somewhere else., 0

This hotel has definitely seen better days. It took about 45 minutes to check in on a Friday afternoon. We were set up in the Central Tower on the 18th floor. Sometimes the elevators will randomly stop on a floor with people in it. Even though we were set up in a non smoking room you could still smell that good old stale cigarette smell that becomes the only thing you can smell while staying here. The carpet was visibly stained which was an immediate turnoff. We tried to activate the in room safe by calling the automated number provided (which stated that the safe would be activated in less than 3 minutes) and after 30 minutes we called the front desk to inquire when it would be active and they told us that "we are really busy but I will try to get somebody up as soon as I can." After about an hour we gave up on the safe and went out. The water pressure in the shower is a joke no matter what time of day you decide to shower. OK, 0
We were looking for a late night dinner and remembered this restaurant.  We settled on sharing of shrimp in black bean sauce and chicken chow fun which were good, 0
Finally left early enough for work to allow me to get a McD's coffee. I don't like the fancy coffees, 0
The ordering process is just ridiculous.  I enjoyed the food when they were Mandarin Wok, 0
Worst hot pot ever.  Why they only serve it between 5 - 10:45pm boggles my mind. They shouldn't be serving it at all for what they give you and at $15 to boot.  Service is very bad too. They barely pay any attention to you.  NOTE: Only reason why I've come here more than once is I was giving myself hope that this place, 0
I stayed at San Carlos May 19th - 20th. It was merely "okay".  I liked:  Historic old school hollywood feel. It was chic. I dug it.  The place had character and I particularly liked the outside of the rooms more than the in. We were in walking distance to the places we wanted to go.   How about no on these items: Surprise! No hotel parking. You can pay the Valet 20 bucks or pay 15 over at chase's parking lot.  Surprise! They hold an extra $25 on your card in case of room damage.  Ghost lounge? It was Saturday night and the dance floor was empty. It wasn't the plan to go there but it was kind of depressing to see that.... Ghosty goodness? Nope. There was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out. My house has had more ghosty vibes and action that I received here.   It has the potential to be pretty awesome but the surprise extra money you end up spending seems like it makes up the difference of what you save. I will probably avoid going here again, 0
Had a living social for $40, 0
Used to be really good. They've had a big turn over in personnel and now you have to go all over the car and check. It takes twice as long. Today it was over an hour, 0
Very very bad service.. Went there twice for shrimp tacos after midnight and they said they couldn't sell them at the time cuz they were "CLEANING" the frier..went back after a half hour like the lady told me and still.cleanjng . Bad experience .. Very lazy workers. Wouldn't go there again, 0
Had to go back because of company in town for family reunion. The help was still great again but could still hear the F&*(%$$ BOMBS coming from management behind the line. Am I the only one who hears this? Hello, 0
A good steakhouse but definitely not worth the price. The steaks were good but the portions on the sides and appetizers were dismal. The apps were also over salted, 0

Maybe I had a very high expectation after reading all the reviews. I've definitely had better massages and a better experience.  The massage was only 45 minutes long when it was supposed to be 60 minutes. I've bought an add-on service (foot scrub), 0
The only word to really describe this stay is "bummer."   Arrived 20 mins before the 3pm check in time and was told the room was ready but it would cost $20 for the "early" check in, 0
Okay...this was very surprising since it was just voted Best Southwestern food in PHX mag's Best of the Valley issue...and thus, 0
Fake fish for California roll and ordered the bento box. Food tasteless, 0
Room was OK...don't touch that weird fuzzy pink throw. Bathroom was in desperate need of a renovation or at least a good scrub. Service was good...honestly didn't interact with the staff during my stay besides checking in., 0
I've been to Matt's three time now and the service here is just slow. The food is great when you get it but 15 before anyone even took my order at the bar?!?  I had my water and left.  The bloody Mary's are great and the food is awesome, 0
Not a great version of Singapore Rice Noodles. The dish was overwhelmed with curry and not the normal yellow curry that most places use, 0
Hated it.  I don't know what else to say. I never ever send food back. Maybe three times in my life. I asked them to remake my burrito, 0
This resturant is good for one thing: birth control.   The food is gross and WAY overpriced.   If you love screaming infants and paying ten dollars for a hot dog, 0
This place is a joke. I'm positive that they have a 16 year old girl running this business (i.e. petty and juvenile). Whatever you do, 0
terrible customer service no manager available when it takes 25 minutes to make a pretzel and a previous visit they shut yogurt machine down 2 hours before closing, 0

I would stay as far away from this place as possible...caught the employees dumpster diving behind the building for plastic bottles to take and get $ to recycle.  I would seriously question the cleanliness of this establishment...eat at your own risk!  I will NEVER eat there after witnessing that!, 0
I am disappointed to write this review. This is my fifth time here and after This experience I feel that burGr has lost it's luster.  We ordered the jalepeno poppers and they were cold inside. The waitress didn't come around to even complain about it to. The burger was eh. Not bad not good. Fries were horrible. Onion rings were delicious though., 0

Barro's Pizza is one mystery that still bugs me to this day. I moved here in 1991 and guys from my job used to order Barro's a lot (mainly from a longtime closed location near Baseline & Hardy). This turned out to be one of my favorite pizza places! The sausage was great, 0

I have been a patient of Dr. Burns for over ten years. I see her for my yearly women wellness check ups. Last week I saw my primary care doctor who recommended I see my OBGYN as soon as possible. I called Dr. Burns office and they wouldn't fit me into their schedule for a week. But I took solace in knowing I was seeing my doctor who has treated me for so long, 0
I was pretty excited when I saw a Pita Pit in the parking lot on Power and Ray. I used to go to the one on mill during my ASU days, 0
I'm embarrassed to admit to my friends reading this review that I ate here.  It was terrible.  Bad service, 0
I was hoping they would be better than the one on LV blvd. NOT. the peach cobbler was totally burned.  don't even know why they bothered to sell that to anybody. the mac and cheese as usual is over cooked. i tried. i can't., 0
Bad service...mediocre food...what more?, 0
First and last time I will ever come to this place! I was completely ignored by the waiter presumably because he thought I was under 21, 0
DO NOT EAT HERE!  We bought the 24 hour buffet pass and we ate at most buffets so we decided to try the one at imperial palace.... omg it was horrible! Horrible salad horrible soup horrible choices of food and nothing was fresh. When we go back to vegas we will definitely skip the buffet at imperial palace., 0
Wouldn't recommend this place. I made the mistake of letting a friend take care of our reservations for the trip. Big mistake. This hotel is gross! Our room had a moldy shower with a blood stained shower curtain, 0
Why does it have to be so cold here?? Nobody check the temps in this freezer airport?? 2 stars for finishing with the construction but non for the climate control! Please keep this place airport temp, 0

I went to this salon b/c it was closer to my house than the one I usually go to. There were two techs and the one that did my nails did a great job but the one who took care of my daughter was awful.  The very next day her nails had chips on the tips and they were gel nails, 0
This is the first time I'm writing about Black Bear. Their food can't be beat for the price and it's homemade! HOWEVER..I am writing this review in the booth of a local Denny's because yet again the service at black bear was bad. We stood and waited for a seat for about 7 minutes... With no one in front of us.. Only to be seated at a booth with the menus thrown on the table. We sit down and our waitress walks past several times... Finally she says "I'll be with you soon" and then proceeds to walk past us another 3 times... She didn't even take our drink order... We walk out, 0
We really wanted Italian food but wanted it to go-didn't feel like sitting in a restaurant this night.  We called Bucca di Beppo and placed our order-very nice lady on the phone.  We let her know that we had a coupon for $10 for our order of $20 or more.   When I got to Bucca to pick up the food the lady that helped me was plain rude! She took my credit card and I asked if she had discounted the coupon and before I could answer she swiped my card. I got my phone out to show her the coupon on my phone and she said "we only take coupons you have to give us." As I was still talking to her she walked away from me-out of the room and showed up behind me with my food-again while I was still taking! Honesty I don't know that I have ever been treated so poorly!  The food was good but I wouldn't recommend going there if that is how they are goign to treat their customers. There are plenty of other options out there with good food that will be happy to take my money!, 0

I had a breakfast sandwich there one afternoon and the eggs were chalky. It was the worst fast food breakfast sandwich I've ever had. It was my first visit to Port of Subs & my last., 0
I had lunch here the other day out of sheer desperation to appease everybodies palettes. It was not my first choice and I cant say that I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends.

IN SHORT: the extreme salespeople and so-so furniture inspired me to rate Walker Furniture a 1 star - defined by Yelp as "Eek! Methinks not." If 'walkers' and rudeness don't phase you, 0
As far as restaurant reviews I go I'm pretty easy going.  I hardly ever rate less than a 3, 0
We only ended up coming here after hitting up Paris and seeing the line snake around the corner which meant we would not be eating for at least an hour. Mind you, 0

I don't think I would come back to this one.  The service was mediocre, 0
If you love cocky pieces of crap that will try and rip you off and have no clue what there talking about .. I would highly recommend this place, 0
This rating is for the counter/cashier for the cook food. I agree with the comment that this ordering/ paying is just unorganized. I hate it when i was there to buy dimsum but ignored that those who are buying food on the right side of the counter.Please add more cash register ., 0
Wish I had seen the Health Dept. score before I ate here. There is no reason for a restaurant to have a 92. The food was cold, 0
In short an unimpressive independent Italian restraint in a overly Italian saturated area.  Over the years this location has changed names and ownership many times, 0
Updated 8/15/2008   This place used to be the best but it has gone down hill terribly while the prices remained very high.  They used to have the freshest fish and now they have some really foul tasting tuna and salmon which has gotten me sick. They advertise their salmon as King Salomon but it really just tastes like raw canned salmon. As I'm a big fan of good Salmon, 0
This theater is just frustrating to me which is why I rarely come here and would rather go to other theaters that are off the strip. First of all, 0

Came here to eat lunch because we had a restaurant.com voucher we needed to use. And it was during the lunch buffet so we couldn't use the voucher. We checked in to get the mango lassi so my bf and I did and then they told us we could only use one per table but they ended up giving us the second one anyway. The masala wasn't spicy at all and the karahi was okay. We didn't even eat half of the karahi. We ordered medium spicy. The older lady was our server and we couldn't understand anything and she was rude as well. She didn't even crack a smile! The older man with glasses was nice. He was the one who gave us a free mango lassi and another on the go., 0
Food was good.  I had the New York burger which was very good.  But the two stars is because of the awful service.  It took five minutes to be seated, 0
The service was great. The staff was friendly. The food wasn't. Bad but it wasn't good. Didn't have much flavor. I wouldn't recommend this place as the food really isn't all that great., 0

Was looking for a singles pick-up place while wandering this part of town. It ain't happening at this hidden joint in a shopping center. Inside was dead as a duck at 9:30pm on a Friday night and the patio had a horrible band playing with about 20 people outside watching. Some were families and a few were couples, 0

If I could put a negative -10 that would be my true rating for this place! I can not believe what I dealt with over the phone. If I wasn't in an office with 3 of my kids around me I would have been able to catch this women's name. With all that was going on I missed it.   I first called to clear my son's insurance information that was on hold. I gave her my son's info and she said she would take car of it when she was done with a patient. Well we are in another office waiting for that to clear so after 5-10 mins I call back and the same lady answers. I inform her on our situation and that we need it cleared asap she talks over me and says we will get to it when we are done with our patients and hangs up the phone. The tone in her voice was so uncalled for and beyond unprofessional.   I was so upset I called back and was able to speak with someone more helpful. Although she was nicer and was able to direct me to the original location I believe it was because she had to make up for her co-worker unprofessionalism.   First off the reason why we didn't go through with this company on Pecos/Warmsprings was due to the lack of customer service. Not only due they lack personal service but even over the phone at the Pecos/Harmon location. I hope the management team that oversees these locations takes the time to re educate their staff on behavior it's one thing to lack in service it's another thing to disrespect clients. NEVER again will we be back!, 0
I called Sears Appliance Repair to make an appointment and they sold me a Warranty Called a Smart Deal that would include the service call and cap off the repair at $279.Yesterday. It would include the service fee and all parts and labor and guarantee the repair for a year. Today the repairman shows up and informs me THEY WON'T HONER MY WARRANTY they sold me yesterday because I have a GE Brand Refrigerator. The repairman was in my home at least an extra hour just spent on the phone talking to various people in Sears canceling my contract and appointment and then setting up a new appointment for the repair without a warranty.    Also the address on my receipt reads.  Sears Home Services Pacific SouthWest Dist. El Cajon CA 92021  I doubt the repairman drove from CA.  Seems like a scam.   I can NO longer TRUST Sears.  I will NEVER BUY or RECOMMEND any GE Appliance.  As an few hour later Update. My husband complained to their service department and Sears refunded us what we thought was fair. I'm happy for that but it wouldn't of happened unless my husband complained to them. I didn't delete or change the Yelp Rating because other people need to know as they might go threw the same thing., 0

I had an appointment scheduled at the office in Henderson on a Wednesday. I received all call from them on the Friday before my visit asking if I could reschedule because the provider was not going to be in on the Wednesday. I rescheduled for the following Monday.  I was told to show up at 2:50 with my downloaded forms completed by the person who rescheduled me. This is what I did.  As I signed in (at 2:50) the girl behind the desk told me my appointment was at 2:40.  I politely told her that when they called me to reschedule I was told 2:50.  She said, 0
I don't see myself as picky. The check in was not a nice experience to begin with. The girl at the counter was very rude. Maybe she was tired since it was 3 am, 0
Service here is absolutely horrendous. We came early for a wine and canvas event. The server that was scheduled to work the event started complaining loudly to her other co workers about us coming early..jeez. I'm sorry we wanted to come early & have some appetizers. Rude? I couldn't believe the attitude we recieved from this establishment. The bartender rushed us through ordering our drinks & seemed annoyed with anything anyone ordered. I felt as if they didn't want us here & that were inconviencing them for wanting to spend money. I hope that they were just havih a bad day because its a real shame to think that a restaurant as nice as this employs such rude, 0
I LOVE Thia Beef Salad, 0
Fun and fairly enxpensive place to meet-up with friends. Although dont expect great mexican food beyond the price you pay., 0
The remodel is very nice but they have eliminated the table in the bathroom. There is no place to put your purse.  I am very displeased with the choice of "relaxing" music. I had to ask the therapist to turn it OFF.  I love my therapist which is the only reason why I will return., 0
I spoke to Natalie on Monday 8/25 and she apologized for the service I had received and offered to refund by Wednesday. I gave her my information that day.   I called on Wednesday and Natalie was not there, 0
I was extremely underwhelmed.  The decor fit a higher end Persian restaurant and the service was average. I am not normally a fan of basil but the basil and onion with their homemade bread was good.  We started off with the hoummos and eggplant but they messed the order up! As the entr\u00e9e, 0

I ordered this for pick up at my job and wasn't the one to get it so I can't say anything of the service, 0
Stopped in here to watch a U of A game and thought we'd found a great place to watch the game due to the fact that it wasn't busy like every other bar on Mill Ave.  Now I know why.  This place has seriously gone downhill since the days of Robbie Fox's.  Our server had a bad attitude, 0
The staff is friendly and the massage was decent, 0
I just left and they did a decent job. But it took over 40 minutes to do a basic wash!!! And they weren't even finished, 0
Terrible service from here last night.  My husband and I walked in around 12:15 am and there was only one bartender by the bar.  We sat down at the bar and did not receive a greeting.  After waiting about 10 minutes we still received no menus or any acknowledgement.  The bartender then proceeded to walk back to the kitchen.  He did see us then and said he would be right back to help us.  After waiting maybe another 5-10 minutes the bartender still had not returned so we left.  Worse service ever!, 0
My Beau and I had date night Saturday evening and couldn't figure out where to go that we haven't been.  It is Madison after all.  Enter George's Chop House in Middleton - it's attached to the Holiday Inn Hotel & Water Park.  I'm not really a steak person and the lady on the phone stated they had a little of everything to taste so...  I got the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer (the sauce was quite thick and it tasted as if from a jar.) The entree I ordered was spaghetti and meatballs. How can you mess this up?  Someone found a way; the noodles & sauce had NO FLAVOR what so ever.  The meatballs were tasty; I looked across the table at my honey & he was like what's wrong and all I could think about was what hot sauce or concoction of toppings at home I had that would breathe life into this dead pasta.  The 2 Goose appletini's I had seemed to deaden my disappointment although not entirely.  He had the scallops through the recommendation of Trey, 0
Very nice staff, 0
I don't know why this restaurant has as high a rating as it does. First off the location on the wrong side of town, 0

I was going to give this place two stars but then I got trapped in an elevator.  I've ridden in a lot of elevators and never once have they turned into the tower of terror with abrupt stops.  Not exactly luxury, 0
OK I am going to stick to the buffet here because the  casino itself I found to be very lovely.   This buffet had to be the worst food I have ever eaten and that's what I could eat because I found 80 % of the buffet choices not even edible.  I have had many buffets over the last few years of living here in Vegas but this was absolutely .... Well lets just say  I  have serious concerns of being sick tonight.  First  it was lunch time  Saturday afternoon ..  We were shocked to find a line  that well lets just say.. IT WAS TO LONG!!! We waited in line for a hour and what we saw shocked us.. Table after table sitting stalemate after  the patrons had left.  All of the people standing in line  waiting and waiting and watching tables empty and not being turned proper.. You know how aggravating that is to see when your waiting in line for a hour? I can tell you its extremely annoying.. So after the hour wait we are finally seated and  now its time to stand in line at the buffet.. What I saw SHOCKED ME !!! Food that looked like slop thrown in trays. I couldn't even tell you what most of it was because it was not labeled. So I stuck with what I knew and what didn't look like a health hazard..  Fried Chicken breast!!!!!! DRY AS CRAP.... Mash potatoes!!!!  COLD AS CRAP.. Macaroni and cheese!!!! IT HAD CHUNKS OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN IT.. Slice of turkey breast !!!!! COLD AND DRY....  This food tasted like it was leftovers from the previous night buffet.. It was extremely disgusting..  I thought well I am parking my butt at the  dessert counter no one can screw that up.. Oh MY Lord I had to eat my words.. I had a cookie that was hard as a rock..... And Stale!!!!  Yes I said stale.. Carrot cake.. So stale it was hard around the edges, 0

I made a huge mistake and did not look at the Yelp reviews before I spent $2700 on repairs.  I asked for the parts and of course they couldn't provide them.

Want to stay in Vegas...but you aren't so poor to sleep in a run down motel...and you don't have enough money for a good casino...welcome to the Strat!  This place is disgusting.  It is dirty, 0
Obviously these people are not from any ivy league state. They wouldn't know a hotdog if it bit them in their buns.  Hot dogs are deep fried. Onions are size of   Chicklettes and peppers come uncooked and whole. Who the hell serves a hotdog with a whole pepper? Go to a baseball game and see how a hotdog is supposed to be served lady.  Avoid this place at all costs! Poor customer service.   Also, 0
Ordered pizza for the first time here for delivery.  Got a Margherita.  It was ok.  A little too much crust with not a lot of flavor.  When delivered it was not hot so must have been sitting for awhile...., 0

Not very good. Fried rice was sticky and no taste. Looked more like Mexican rice. Beef broccoli and orange chicken were both bland and no flavor. Worst egg roles I have ever tasted.   Not sure I will give them another chance. Too many good Chinese restaurants available to go back to a poor one., 0
I was so disappointed tonight.  I have been going to Flancers with my family for so long, 0
This place is ghetto. The buffet is nasty. The Mexican restaurant is pretty good.  This plAce Is dirty and nasty. A lot of lowlifes hang out there. Expect to see thugs and pimps and prostitutes and drug dealers there. The staff is not friendly and the gaming sucks. The parking lot Is dangerous so be careful and hold your wallet and purse!!!, 0

Made a return trip this past week because my buddy raved over his chicken dish he got here a year ago(seriously. he went into the kitchen after the meal and thanked the cook). No dice this time. Us being a group of four rolled into this joint without a reservation hoping to get seated. Imagine our delight when we walk into a place with less than half the tables occupied. The host went over to the bartender after we spoke with him and we got the look. You know the look. It's an over the shoulder glance of disgust and "not these people". The host returned and told us a 1 hour wait. I believe my half buzzed response was no way or something to that effect. The wife pointed towards the plethora of empty tables and we were told those were reservations. Immediately I called Guinness Book because this place had to be near setting a record for reservations. We mosied on over to another establishment that probably blows this one out of the water. You get 1 star because I have to give you one and another for the grub my buddy had last year., 0
Beware of this mortgage lender.    They will pre-approve your mortgage, 0
Awful place. The woman that works there has the most awful personality. They bait and switch the customer. I purchased a package for 5 colonic sessions I used only 3 and had 2 remaining. I scheduled my appointment and informed them that I had 2 sessions I was told that that was fine and scheduled the appointment. When I arrived she informed me my package was expired. I was shocked and told her that there was no expiration date on the package. She basically said oh well and said that she would not honor the package or refund the unused portion. I have filed a BBB complaint and have forwarded the email from which I purchased the package to the company. Nowhere does it say there is a time limit in which to use the colonics.  Incidentally they blast religious music without any regard to what you the customer would like to hear, 0
This is a very sad and scary lab. The location moved from a fairly old and dingy space to a newer location, 0
Went in for a late lunch, 0
The reviews go to show that trendy new spots get rave reviews no matter how good the food is. I can say that the service was very good. To start the waitress said that Fuego makes the best mojito in town and I was so intrigued because in my mind Havana Cafe makes the best Mojito I have ever had. The mojito at Fuego doesn't stand a chance, 0
It's a shame when good food is held hostage by a rude staff. This is the only taco shop I've ever been to where nobody who works there seems to want to make a taco. If you do go, 0

My daughter and son bought their Dad a pedicure for Father's Day this past year. Last weekend was the first time he was able to use it. A lady worked on my husband's feet. The experience was alright for him, 0
Not only the worst BK franchise I've ever been to... but probably the worst-managed restaurant franchise I've ever encountered. It's a like a bad (bad) movie...  OPEN ON two guys and a girl in a GREEN SOUL ordering drive through from Burger King on East Wash. They are hungry, 0
I would have given this store zero stars if possible.  The employees lack zero amount of professionalism and lie to you because they think they're telling you what you want to hear.  Don't waste your time.  Well, 0
Did eyebrows with Meena. She was nice, 0
Walked in and no one greeted me although I saw about 3 girls that worked there that I know for a fact saw me. They gave a look like I shouldn't be shopping there. No one was helpful and it's a shame too because I was in there to do a little shopping for my daughters birthday. One thing I will not tolerate is bad customer service which starts the second you walk into an establishment. Will not go back!, 0

Don't expect any compassion here. I broke my arm and was referred by the ER here. The doctor I saw here told me I needed surgery very soon. He was ready to schedule the surgery until he found out I was uninsured. I was told I would receive a call the following day with sone financial options for me. I never received a.call. I left several messages and they did not even have the decency to call me and tell me take a leap. I realize they are in the business to make money, 0
Place sucks. 80% of there dryers are out of order. The employees are either walking around with no shoes on or have family around. Very dirty place., 0
Front desk agent was nice. Told me my room as recently renovated. Either that's not true or they upgraded with cheap material. The hair dryer is connected to the wall, 0
Went to this bank with my mother in law to open up a safety deposit box. we called before heading over to see if this was possible since we had no wells fargo account. When we got there we were talked to by the store manager who we heard within earshot sigh and tell a coworker "hmph lets see what these people want" looking pissed that she had to talk to us, 0
Nice campus... Great live music... But the pastor preaches on pre taped video which is distributed to their various locations around town... My family found the experience a tad strange.   To be more efficient next week I  am going to pull out my guitar at home and sing some songs with the family and watch Joel Osteen on TV., 0

Came here for lunch when we first arrived at the towers on Friday.  I had a double burger and wasnt really impressed with it.  The meat was stiff as a board/very dry when I asked for medium.  The sides were nothing to write home about either, 0
Expensive and not that good ..the food is kind of bland. Being Jamaican myself they could do so much better. Will not be going back unless it's for something they don't cook. I was not impressed at all., 0
Very unprofessional.  Very rude and condescending on the phone.  I would never hire such a rude person., 0

Been here a few times.  While it has a nice view and it can be fun once inside, 0
If you think this place is ok then obviously you dont know what to look for. I agree with the restrooms being absolutely disgusting every time ive been here.it grosses me out to think about whos in charge here and are their kitchen practices or personnel / personal hygeine  ok? The girl at the front is very rude and didnt say 1 word or thanks when we paid.....just gave me the receipt???  General Tsos chicken taste like deep fat fryer scraps of rubber? Sweet and sour sauce is horrible....tastes like water?       It USED to be fresher but its obviously going down hill for them? Ive chosen other places as my favorite. Rice n noodle (windmill - s. jones) and Baidu (robindale -s. jones) Blows them away!!!! I will no longer be returning .....Sorry Nooooo I should be saying thanks!, 0
So after venturing up to cave creek in hopes of going to the spotted donkey (which we never found.. Thx to the wrong map on yelp!) We were starving and just wanted to eat so we found this joint. And eat I got. It was worse then those restaurants that were names "eat" that I would see along the roadside as a kid(which I never ate at). Nothing for vegetarins here other than fried fish. I had green chile soup, 0
I've stayed here twice and had "meh" experiences both times. Both were for the weekend of EDC Las Vegas, 0

Brio used to be my favorite restaurant. Lately the quality and attention to detail have suffered tremendously! I have found a fly in my salad and then last Mother's day I found a long black hair in my eggs Benedict! not to mention chips in many of the plates and cups. Very disappointed., 0
We had family in from Richmond and brought them down to the Strip to souvenir shop. My husband and I have eaten here twice before and absolutely loved it. This time the food was excellent again.  We didn't like the way the meals were brought out one at a time and far in between.  Upon opening her silverware, 0
I really wasn't impressed with this place.  My group waited for almost 2 hours for a table (during which time we went from a group of 8 to a group of 4 - I stuck it out because my brother claimed it was amazing). After we FINALLY got a table, 0
I don't get the attraction to this place! The clothes are not that cute and they are outrageously overpriced. If they weren't having a 40% off sale, 0

Its your typical taco bell ...but  If you use the drive thru expect a heavy unpleasant odor..and the few times i've gone..they've gotten my order wrong..or took forever, 0
this is the former Misaki Buffet .  i believe one of the 2 owner/investors wanted out and thus the name change.  there's less sushi than there used to be and no nigiri pieces.  it's all the same American / Americanized-Chinese food on the buffets. it was initially $6.99 but they just raised the lunch (m-f) price to $7.99 as of June 2014.  I suspect it will continue to rise until they notice people aren't coming as often. To be honest the food is not really worth any more than the current price and you can have the proper real-deal sushi experience at places like "Oriental Buffet" on McKnight Road or Hokkaido Buffet in the East end near the Waterfront area.  They are a dollar or 2 more for lunch but are definetly better in quality (and atmosphere)  The problem with this space is that it's the former Tambellini Italian restaurant with all the requisite tacky Italian ristorante old school decor and embellishments.  This gets on my nerves but clearly the new owners are not interested in re-doing the interior.  The lighting can be very dim, 0
I have ate here a lot and got it to go. Today we ordered my pizza and wings TO GO and they marked it dine in. So my wings came out 10 mins before pizza was done. Making my wings get cold as I waited for the pizza to get done., 0
The staff was bad.  They almost did not allow me to take my test after producing a valid government ID.  After I produced another form of ID, 0
This rag looks cool.  They review all the trendy-ass-kissing bands.  They have a great layout.  And they want so badly to be a mover and a shaker in the community.     So what's wrong?  They (like a lot of publications) are entirely blinded by the bottom line (rather than readership), 0

I met with Lexy to go over my save the dates- said she would be in contact with me in a week. I finally had to text her after 2wks as I still didn't receive the rough draft of my save the dates. After I sent her a text she quickly emailed me with what looks like a quickly thrown together save the date. I emailed her back about my changes to the draft- WEEKS went by and she never responded to my emails and text messages about changes to the invites. I understand people get busy but LACK of communication or really NO communication is just unprofessional-especially when you run a business. I finally texted her to cancel my order and you would think she would be professional enough to respond, 0
The WORST service I have ever had in a restaurant in Las Vegas. Two stars only because the food was very good. Otherwise I would give one star. It has the prices (and food) that go along with a fine dining establishment, 0

Very disappointing experience.  Only 7 tables inside and out. Tiny restaurant. At first it looked like a local gem. We sat at a table for two & 4 other tables already had their food. No one else was there. We ordered a big breakfast & had about an hour before we needed to be somewhere. 30 min later we still didn't have our breakfast & a few more groups had been seated while we were waiting. Another couple, 0
Signed up for this gym before it even opened. I got the premier membership and find that I'm not using the classes so I decided to go down to the basic.  Their new prices means I would have limited days to go in which is fine with me.  But they wanted to charge me what is equivalent to 5 months of membership to to make this change.  So I just cancelled without any fee. This is so short sighted on their behalf.  It cost them nothing to change my membership and only the same amount of time as it did to cancel.  They will lose out on the revenue of all my future months of membership. New management is not very bright and I don't see this gym staying around for much longer.    By the way you always help out the first person and not keep them waiting while you help subsequent  people with same issues, 0
Came here for breakfast.  Maybe we are spoiled from Mon Ami Gabi (they were packed) but it was very bland and overpriced for what you get., 0
I take myself and I keep on saying out loud to myself "I'm wanting a shake" my friend wants one too so after the cashier here's us and when we ask to order he says the shake machines busted. I also had to go up to the counter 3 more times because of horrible service., 0

You just can't successfully imitate Chipotle. The food here is mediocre at best. The guac tastes like it was squeezed out of a bag. Definitely will not be back., 0
At this El Pollo Loco they charge more for some items than any other El Pollo Loco I have been to. What happened to me is I simply asked for black beans instead of the pinto beans in a burrito and was told they might charge more. The manager came out and rudely said it would be .49 more. This is even after I mentioned that the 3 other El Pollo Loco's I go to do not charge more. I wasn't asking for a side dish, 0

Well Kevin after years I have finally found your scumbag con artist ass. This so called "website developer" is a thief of the highest order. He was recommended by a friend who was also in the computer business and this work was to be done for my boss. Once getting my boss in contact with Kevin and before any payments were made Kevin came off as intelligent and easily approachable about problems as well as easily contacted. After multiple promises of work to be done and sending back and forth of paperwork and several thousand dollars we get some semblance of a web site working 11 months later...now mind you its non operational but it is barely functioning....after more talks with Kevin and several thousand more dollars this piece of shit fuckhead falls off the face of the earth. Takes the money and runs so to speak. Stops responding to calls and emails. Changes phone numbers after a few months....new contact information is found and he answers the call SURPRISE!!. Well he is apologetic and professional sounding and says he will get right back to us ....SURPRISE SURPRISE!!!! that cowardly fuck falls off the earth again. Well Kevin Taylor of KT Graphics we got your sorry ass now......social media has found you in vegas and operating again....stand by for the coming subpoena....as they say...."SEE YOU IN COURT"., 0
I was there the first weekend it was open; the food was so-so. It was a bit of a turn off when you walked into the front of the restaurant and the management and possible owners were huddled by the front door - not to greet you, 0
We were a party of 4 on Sunday night at 5:00. Plenty of tables available and got seated right away. Outside which was nice. The owner who seated us didn't say one word just walked us to a table and pointed. I ordered Chicken Parm.. $21 for a piece of chicken and some sauce and cheese. Okay, 0
I felt it was over priced for what I got.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with everything.  The meat patty was fine but the bacon was burned.  I was disappointed at what seemed to be can mushrooms.  The whole thing disintegrated before I was was half way through and I was left picking bits up off the table.  There are definitely better burgers for less money elsewhere on State street, 0
I feel violated and taken advantage of. Last night I asked Barb to get a bottle of water as it was a 100 degrees outside by the pool and needed to hydrate. 30 minutes later Barb returns with 2 bottles of water informing me that she was charged $8.00 a bottle. $16.00 total for the bottles. Seeing as there was no other source for getting water other than paying the ransom she purchased the bottles. This is unethical and price gouging at its worst. Will never return., 0
Don't order your burger medium. Or medium well. Medium was cold and RED inside. Our order took 30 minutes to get to our table. My wife ordered hers Medium-Well. The server said ' it took 30 minutes because you ordered this one Medium-Well. What??? Good thing she didn't say we'll done! Our Sweet Potato fries were burnt. Our server Diego was very nice and apologetic. The manager, 0
I stayed at TI this past 4th of July weekend and I was happy at the first visit but not so thrilled the second time. First off the in room description says average cost per person is $12 ...um maybe like 10yrs ago cause both times I went my bill was over $20 for just myself. Which was in my opinion WAY too expensive for breakfast. I asked for cheddar cheese on my eggs and it came back with an square piece of melted American on it which i was disappointed with. I asked for bacon well done and it came out not well done. I had to send back my coffee because it was too watery. btw ---this was on the second day, 0

Comme Moise disait a ... \u00e7a l\u00e8ve pas !! M\u00eame dans des conditions id\u00e9al comme un combat de la UFC avec GSP ou lors d'un 7em match en s\u00e9rie du CH contre Pittsburg ce bar sportif manque franchement d'ambiance.  J'y suis all\u00e9 beaucoup dans le pass\u00e9 ( la blonde d'un de mes amis y travaillait ) et j'y vais encore quand je n'ai pas le choix! L'avantage qu'ils ont c'est qu'ils pr\u00e9sentent une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9v\u00e9nement sportif et que c'est probablement la derni\u00e8re option qu'il reste au centre-ville pour voir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement majeur quand les autres endroits sont plein.

BLUH. Just...bluh.   I had a layover in Phoenix when I was in the process of moving to ABQ and the airport was...gross. I really don't know how to describe it other than crusty and needing a massive scrub down. Then when it came to the overhead announcements, 0

I spent 70.00 and I would have had more satisfaction setting it on fire. We had so many issues during this meal that I don't have enough time to type them all. It was HORRIBLE.

Overrated. I prefer the buffet at Aria, 0
I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old....Never again! Chodang, 0

This place was great when it was the Kennedy. Ever since then it seems like the food and quality of service has gone down a bit.  My most recent experience here involved the graveyard male bartender. My friend and I came in for a few drinks and although the bartender was attentive to us he was not attentive to our needs at all. In other words he kept interupting our conversations and talking to us and asking a lot of personal type questions and then when he would walk away he would keep eyeing us. My friend and I are both men and take no issue to being flirted with or hit on by other guys (although we are straight) but this guy was very unprofessional and made us feel very uncomfortable.  Before we left there was another customer that came in and sat at the bar, 0
Hours of operation are convenient but the service people are rude! They force single diners to sit at the bar - eventhough it is lunch time on a weekday with loads of open space!  Wait staff have no sense of urgency and do not check on you mid-meal - so you spend most of your time looking for someone and raising your hand trying to catch their attention., 0

I have sampled their product at the Farmers Market and in their store. I have also sampled their personality at both locations. I think I was served by the owner at the Farmers Market and her mother at the store. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. The daughter is definitely worse than the mother though. They are both quite rude and very lacking in business and people skills. They should perhaps concentrate on wholesale or internet marketing where they don't have to interact with people because they are quite unpleasant to deal with. Their prices are crazy too but that's possibly good because this stuff is very good to eat but not good for you. However, 0
I ate here for the first time today. I was really looking forward to it because I had heard so many great things about Rachel's kitchen. After eating here I cannot imagine what they were talking about. The food was less than mediocre.   I had Rachel's chicken salad sandwich and sweet potato fries. The fries were cold. I mean very cold, 0
I had pretty much given up on dining at this Deli but my wife likes a few of their items so we gave them another shot if she agreed to order. Reason being is that you call them with a to-go order and automatically get put on hold....why would you not have the person that answers the phone be ready to take an order or transfer if need be...  Sure enough after waiting about 5 minutes my wife had to call back and ask not to be put on hold and get the order started...funny thing they were able to take the order just like that....  upon arriving at the store and going to to-go register it took another 5 minutes to even be acknowledged....I actually got barked at the time before for stepping up to the to-go register while other people were waiting....  worst french dip I have ever had...it truly tasted like college cafeteria food...   never again.....if I could give zero stars i would, 0

First time to this place.... Now I may be tough due to the fact that I am in restaurant business for over 17 yrs.. Service on a scale of 1 to 10 .. 10 being top score they score 4 Food 8 Price score 5 very expensive when you add your sides and so on( at high tide seafood bar and grill ) surf and turf lobster / burger with sides and cheese $14.. Here just cheese burger and fries is $17.  Kale salad very odd.. Waiter never refill water... Lack of consistency ... Not friendly ... Hostess were good.. Managers walking around and never check tables .. A dirty table with dirty dishes sitting next to us for about 12 mins and almost 7 staff walk by and look at the dirty table and walk to the kitchen barehanded .. Finally hostess started to clean it... Would I go back.. Probably not.. Overall they score low with me..., 0
The bottom line: Despite some great dishes (mmm, 0

Never coming here again. Worst customer service experience I have ever had. The lady that was cutting my hair yelled at me for correcting her mistake and she did not even fix it. The Workers here really need to go back to cosmetology school  to relearn  the basics. She kept saying "not finish yet don't worry" just to shut me up! With this place you get less than what you pay for. I came in hoping for a great deal came out disappointed and angry. Don't waste your time in money your better off going to Fantastic Sams or Great Clips., 0

Below average for sure. The only thing memorable about thing place was how much of a rush our server was in to get us to order our lunch.  Pei Wei box dinners from walmart are tastier. The wife got four pieces of shrimp in the Szechuan shrimp. My orange chicken seemed to have been frozen-fried and doused in a molasses and marmalade mix - yuck. The fried rice had 2 peas a one carrot chunk in it.  Not even if I was starving would I come back!!!, 0
Atmosphere: What a benefit to Crave that they are one of the only restaurants open during the opening of DTS. Crave feels like it's menu of Sushi/Burgers... Identity confused. The sushi smell will likely knock you over when you walk in the door.The hostess could use some classes on cordiality, 0

Obviously we all know Sprint is still "working" on their tower upgrade in Glendale but this store has gone downhill. Walked in today 6 employees literally standing around chatting. Brian helped me but we could tell he hates his job..it shows. Horrible attitude, 0

If they were selling $1 cupcakes I'd give them 3 Stars.  But they're asking a premium for small cupcakes.  The cupcakes themselves are hard, 0

I always went to Nordstrom to purchase new cologne's in the past and since I was going to have lunch at the Fashion Show Mall I decided it was time for some new fragrances.   I went into the Men's department only to be disappointed by a sales person who couldn't give me the time of day.  He completely ignored me and after 15 minutes of just standing there next to the selections testing each and every one I finally gave up and went to Saks Fifth Avenue and had a phenomenal experience and couldn't be more pleased.      Nordstrom you lost yourself a regular customer., 0

First and last time going to this place. I got there at 12pm ordered a jerk chicken sandwich and a salad for my wife. At 12:40pm the manager comes and tells me its going to be a few minutes more. To which I replied "What" you mean to tell me it takes u 40 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich. And the place was not even full of people. Bad service do not recommend going there., 0
Let me start this review off by stating that I only review places I either really love and feel deserve positive praises or places that completely suck and I would not refer my enemies to. With that idea in mind this review is going to be a rant, 0

Overpriced... Artificially red salad dressing on a boring salad is just terrible... Honestly, 0

I was excited to hear there was a boba place opening near my house and I didn't have to travel all the way to Bombboba or Yo & I anymore just for good boba. My kids told me they've tried it when the place first opened and that the boba was terrible. I figured I'd give their milk tea boba a try, 0
Beware! Horrible service. We went to all you can eat lunch and if you leave meat on the plate the waiter will charge you extra at the end of lunch. The meat looked like dog food with no flavor. I left the place wanting to throw up. Never again!!!!!!, 0

So disappointed with SW.  My boyfriend and I were staying at the Wynn and were looking forward to dining at SW we had heard wonderful things about it.  However the experience was horrible.  Our waitress made a point of gesturing to the specials on the menu and then said I won't explain them you can just read them.  Um isn't that her job to explain the menu?! We asked for just the pretzel bread but were given the mixed bread with no explanation of what types of bread we were being given. The restaurant was EXTREMELY loud and my boyfriend and I couldn't even have a conversation because we couldn't hear each other over the noise.  Our food was good.  We had the chateaubriand which was melt in your mouth tender, 0
Creepiest place ever. Didnt even get out of my car after a group of shady people started staring at my in the parking lot. Don't go here., 0
This is the worst Cracker Barrel I have ever visited.   We were a party of four close to 7:00 pm for dinner. They were not busy at all, 0
My husband and I joined the gym in January and as it had been a while for me - I signed up for a trainer - I was told it was a 3-month contract and that I could easily cancel if it wasn't meeting my needs.  So fast-forward 2 months and the trainer that I had been working with was let go ... and I don't get a call to set up a new training appt.  I go in to cancel the training thinking it would be easy - only to find out that not only is it not easy - I would be charged the full amount and if I don't pay it - it goes to collection.  The new training manager only seemed to be able to say he was sorry and nothing else to help - so I would totally suggest if you are looking for training go somewhere else - this place isn't worth it - and as for the rest of the gym - it's okay - but not worth the hassle!, 0

10-25-2013 Monday 6 PM party of four. We were seated and immediately were approached by a very rude server female. I was clear she didn't want to be there let alone serve us.

It's too bad. The cats are cute. The concept is nice. I waited for 15 minutes for someone to come serve me and no one came. I spent my time watching people take selfies and photos with cats.

It's not as run down as most of the CEC's I've been to before and there's a lot of parking even a creepy back alley of parking spaces (don't park there!). With that being said I just can't stand this place. It's loud, 0
Biggest problem here is inconsistency. Have been half a dozen times, 0
To be honest I expected better. The burger was sloppy and the food was over-priced. I paid $22 for one combo and one with just a burger and drink. Not cool fatburger!, 0

This church is all about prosperity gospel preaching. Money money money. It is more concerned with tickling the congregations ear instead of confronting sin. It is more concerned with growing its congregation and revenues by appealing to the "modern day Christian." Some so called Christians choose to be Christians because they expect to gain some sort of worldly blessing from it. But being a Christian entails suffering and sacrifice because you are not supposed to conform to the world. In Matthew 7:21-23 Jesus talks about true and false disciples. He is not talking to atheists, 0
I have been a Jamba juice customer for years! Recently I've been coming to this location because they do half off smoothies before 10am.  The owner has decided to flip-flop on this policy that has earned them my business.  I will not be coming back, 0
Not sure about all the hubbub.   The samples were nice but the food didn't do anything special for me.   The cookies at the end were delightful.     I'm not sure that Chinese and Mexican belong together.   My husband liked the relleno but wasn't wild about it.      The people were all incredibly nice hence 2 stars., 0
Meh.   It just seems Gamestops in general have gotten worse and only worth it if you're trading in probably. We were the only adults in there and it was a busy Sunday with a bunch of parents and kids there...most older parents like that don't play games and don't really know about pricing and just want to do right by their kid. I remember a time where you'll see a bunch of gamers in here but the fact I don't anymore says a lot.   More steals your money than deals. A pre-owned game is priced like $5 less than brand new so there isn't much of a savings. A used/refurbished PS3 stack on the floor had two prices on it $299 and $249 (assuming for a lesser GB or older body one)....seriously- for $299 you can get it new, 0

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I don't know how this company has such good reviews. I wish I could review the work but they never showed up to do the work. I spoke with Jayson to have a new door installed on a home and he said he would go out to the house the next day and email me the estimate. After waiting three days and not getting any email I called Jason and asked what happened and he laughed and said oh ya I never made it out to that home.   This is not a professional company and you should stay away from them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Find someone who will actually show up., 0
I think my expectations were too high for Playboy Club so when I walked in I was a bit underwhelmed.  I went on a Sunday night around 10PM (cover was free for ladies and $10 for gents).  When I went there were only two people manning the bar so it was really difficult to get a drink although my bartender was speedy and apologetic.  Love the view from both sides of the club!  So pretty!  Music was good but I'd say Playboy Club is more for lounging and gambling than dancing., 0
Sat down at a booth waited for about 10-15 mins for service, 0
The weirdest service I have ever received. I purchased a $13 for $24 Groupon and visited the location at 6:30PM on a Sunday evening. The restaurant has two doors - the left door says Thai and the right door says Vietnamese; they both go into the same place. There are two other couples in the restaurant out of 70 seats. We sit down, 0
I had the Fettuccini Cassanova. The description on the menu sounded wonderful be it lacked flavor. I rarely salt my food but had to go two rounds with the salt shaker service was a little hovering., 0

Went to see Above & Beyond spin on 2/19/11. I love A&B so my girlfriends and I were excited to see them spin at a new venue. We had front of the line privileges with no cover charge...this club STILL sucked! The layout is awful with little or no room to dance. They packed the entire club to full capacity (or over) which made it absolutely impossible to maneuver anywhere. What a huge cluster-f**k! The lack of organization was unacceptable. Unless you like to be pushed, 0

I give them a 2 not a 1 because they actually had the best ribs ever!. They were over priced and the corn bread and various other things had trans fat in it. I confronted the president to alert them of my finding.  I told them I saw it listed in the ingredients on the corn bread.  Then questioned why have a bakery and have fresh baked bread when your using the ingredients of a sit on the shelf forever and not go bad bread?  She wrote back and told me they called the chef and they dont use it.  WTF? Its on the ingredients on the package, 0

Yuck!!!  What kind of generic ass Japanese restaurant is this??!!  I think it's supposed to be some type of asian fusion??  The feel of Kona is very commercialized and seemed like it fell into the category of being 'just another chain restaurant.'

This place has the potential to be great but they need to work out the kinks in the kitchen and better train the waitstaff first.  Dined here Saturday night with another couple and the meal was pretty awful.  Service was good from friendly waitstaff but they don't know enough about the menu to be very helpful.  We've dined all over the world but still had questions about the eclectic menu; our poor waitress had to go back to the chef several times to ask what ingredients were or how things were prepared.  Our bruschetta app was burned black and our server kindly returned it to be refired - but really, 0
My heater went out and our landlord's maintenance plan sent out this company to take a look.  The technician that showed up was very friendly and immediately found out that our thermostat was not wired correctly. He gave me a bunch of tips for heating and cooling our place efficiently.  The heater was running so I headed off to work thinking the problem had been fixed. I came home for lunch and the house was colder than when I left and the heater was still running.  I called him immediately and he said he was on a job and would call me right back.  I waited....  I called again the next morning and left him a message.  THREE days later he called my cell and told me he was at my front door. I had no notice that he was coming so I was not home.   Too little too late.   Turns out the entire heating unit has to be replaced..., 0

HORRIBLE customer service!!! Tried to redeem my check in offer and the manager (Victor) was a complete dick! First he said that the coupon needed to be printed when it clearly said to show it to the manager at the bottom of the screen. He then tells me that he can't redeem the coupon because they have the special only on Mondays and Tuesdays. Meanwhile his attitude while explaining this to me did not help at all!, 0

I agree with pretty much every review. The Capri slogan is "Redefining excellence". That is effing Hilarious.The Capri is super dumpy. We had hoarder neighbors that lead to a cockroach infestation in our apartment. The hot water was out all thru the holidays of 2011 and typically goes out at least once per month. My GF and I had to shower and get ready for work at our gym for an entire week during that time. The hallways smell like hot trash all the time. The parking situation is really shitty and your car will get dinged constantly. The people in the office are not accommodating or understanding about anything. They roped us into paying a "prorated (increased) rate" for an extra 3 weeks because we didn't go to the office and sign a 60 day intent to vacate notice. Even though I emailed them twice when I was out of town telling them we were not going to renew. The only positive thing about the Capri is the onsite Capri marketplace and that it is in a good location near great restaurants, 0

Service was good but food was overpriced and undercooked.  It's obvious that they use precooked pizzas and reheat them with the toppings you order.  The toppings were raw and the bottom of the pizza burnt.  Be careful if trying to use an online gift certificate because they are not valid during "events".  We found out a hockey game was in progress and they refused to honor the gift certificate.  This place is already out of business, 0
We watch Gordon Ramsay all the time and were so excited to have a reservation in one of restaurants - so disappointed. First, 0
I didn't even order from this place but i will never go there. I was walking out of the gas station on Sunday and I over heard an argument with a guy that works there and a customer over salsa the guy at the counter came around and got in the face of the customer and looked like he wanted to fight him throwing out f bombs left and right. In front of 4 other customers waiting to order and pick up their orders. I'm ok with standing up for yourself but the argument started because the customer asked for salsa and the worker yelled and told him he had to pay for it. Worst customer service I have ever seen and I hope the kid gets fired., 0
Very marginal.  The skate was over cooked.  The lamb was tough.  The French onion soup had far too much wine., 0
This McDonald has useless workers who don't listen when taking an order.  It's not that had to push a button that says no onions on a cheeseburger. If I hadn't looked my son would had eaten onions that he is not able to eat. Great job McDonalds for trying to kill my son. Get real employees that listen when taking an order, 0

This place is stupid. It just doesn't make sense at all. I couldn't even figure out what the hell was going on here.   The bar area has like three tv's. I just wanted to have some happy hour drinks and bet on some horse to start the day. TV's showing horses were not near the bar.   The bartender was a toolbox. We ordered our well drinks, 0
I gave this place 1 star because of the salsa.  Other than that this was most likely one of the worst places I've eaten...and the service was horrible as well. Frozen, 0
Horrible!!! Nastiest Sh*t I've ever eaten!!! Ridiculous amounts of Garlic and absolutely no flavoring on the burrito (Carne Asada). Funny how they're proud of their prices... $7 burrito that tastes like sh*t. Go to Roberto's, 0

I not sure if this place has closed or not but I was soooo disappointed after reading many great reviews about this place and their amazing cocktails that I told my girl to get all dressed up because I wanted to surprise her and take her to this unique speakeasy. We went on Saturday night Feb 1st around 10pm after a long drive to get there and the front door was locked. We stood there for a while because I was pretty irritated and in disbelief about making the journey just to try this place out and not one sign on the door or anything on their website whatsoever about being closed for whatever the reason may be....A few other people tried getting in as well while we were standing there in awe and we all were wondering why it was closed even though their window lights were still on. Maybe their website should actually have some information about  the place and weather or not it is closed or open. I spent my money elsewhere on the south-side this night....  Your's truely...The Shaw, 0
Just finished our 1st and our last meal here...the food was average like a denny's or  IHOP. I won't say I won't eat there again just because the whites of my husbands eggs weren't cooked it could happen to anyone. The reasons we won't eat there again are because we watched the cook go into & out of the restroom with his apron on GROSS! The staff was not rude but I have no idea what our servers name was because she didn't say more than 10 words to us the entire meal. The restaurant is very outdated the walls and floors could use a good scrubbing and it is very poorly lit...my 1st thought was they need Robert from Food Networks Restaurant Impossible!, 0
Burnt my hair!!  I don't know how to keep this review short, 0
Why didn't I check yelp?   Terrible service. Poor security. Vehicle got broken into during my last day at their lot and manager on duty couldn't be bothered. She kept asking if we were still leaving that day.  I'm giving 2 stars since the rooms themselves are decent and clean.  If you want a cheap place to stay and not concerned about security, 0
My DH & I  went for our anniversary last night, 0
Wow this place is a rip off. Better off going to Grand Lux Cafe across the street at the Palazzo if you want good value.   We had a large table of 10+ so getting the table for a group that size wasn't hard.  Food took a very long time to arrive.   I stuck with something safe like a Portabello Mushroom burger. It was tasty but for the price I paid ... $15 bucks I expect something like omg wow. I rather go to Carls Jr for $6 and be happy and full. The stuff my friends ordered looked ok but It didn't seem to wow me for the price. Some one complained that their salad sucked ...   With $15 I could have gone across the street to Grand Lux and hit up their breakfast buffet. So please read my Grand Lux review for their all you can eat breakfast., 0
We started off using the cleaning solution on a groupon. Our first experience was good-friendly quick reply and a great clean. We then signed up for reoccurring cleaning and requested Thomas G because he does an amazing job and knows our dogs. We we're told he'd come and if he wasn't coming they would let us know so we can leave the dogs in the kennel or outside. They did not let us know and the new cleaners would not go into the house because the dogs we're barking at them(completely understandable). When we talked with the holly and one other person (can't remember the name) they we're rude and continued to tell us "sorry you're dogs didn't let your house get cleaned" They also did not make any attempts to reschedule. Then they double charged us for cleaning.  The quality of cleaning was good from Thomas but otherwise was horrible. One time when Thomas didn't come we had to have someone come out and re clean because the house was still dirty. I couldn't even tell that someone had been there. When we first complained again horrible customer service.  After a little over six months and any attempts at making things work, 0
Will never eat here again. Sandwich was meteocre and overpriced. On top Of that I was charged more than I was told the total was. Horrible first time experience!, 0

Its just not my thing. Its super loud and always way too packed. The atmosphere is nice so I get its popularity but if I want to go to a coffee shop I'd like a place to sit. The reason I give it two stars is because I think the coffee is not very good. Its kind of bitter and leaves me with an unpleasant aftertaste. I drink a lot of coffee and I might actually prefer a starbucks coffee over this.   The pastries are defrosted mediocre items. The food is microwaved and low quality. I remember 5 years ago in Milwaukee the food was really good. I wonder if the quality has diminished as it has expanded?, 0
There's really not much to say about this place, 0
This is literally the worst mcdonald's I have ever gone to. In the last week I went to separate times to get an iced coffee before work in the morning. Only to be told that their machine is down for cleaning. Just a hint....AZ is hot at 6:30am and choosing to clean your coffee machines at 6 in the morning is ridiculous....... most people drink coffee when???? THE MORNING!!!, 0

Like everyone else... I have things to do and ppl to see. It's a little over an hour now and still no progress. I look over their office and see the doc laughing and playing on his phone with his assistant or something. I'm sitting here with my shoulder in pain and its pissing me off. Costumer service sucks over here. I'm most defiantly not coming back to this urgent care., 0
I was in the store for over 20 min with my 3 year old and asked if my small box of toys was ready. An employee asked the owner Lisa who was chatting with friends about her vacation plans to please finish my box, 0

My husband recently had a minor accident w/ his motorcycle on the way home from work late one evening recently.  We had his bike towed home until we could make arrangements w/ a repair shop.  Phoenix Metro Towing was called to pick the bike up at our house in Peoria and transport it to Apache Motorcycle in Mesa.  Our insurance company said the transport would be covered.  Loading the bike was a challenge and had I not walked out the door, 0
Very unsatisfied with the FOOD. Service was great, 0
On paper everything looked great: grass fed naturally raised beef and good ingredients. Unfortunately they didn't execute on a good plan.  I ordered the American Kobe beef burger medium-well with fries. I'm not sure I received the Kobe that I ordered because two thirds in it became apparent that it was well done. It was nearly burnt to a crisp and not just around the edges as I had thought. The fries were passable but mostly forgettable.  The service was okay at best. After we ordered we were passed off to two second stringers that were entirely uncoordinated. We were asked at least three times if we needed a box for leftovers, 0

Chinese food in buffet.  Not planning on visiting here again.  I am not a fan of employees cleaning windows right next to the table I am eating at.  Spraying window cleaner by my plate is not a good idea. :)   The food was so-so and service OK.  What else to say?  Wish I could like the place, 0
TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We will never go back. They couldn't get our order right again. When I told them about it they wouldn't do anything about. We are done. Been there 3 times now and all 3 times has been bad. To have a good successful business you MUST have good customer service with smiling faces. You sure don't see that there., 0
Arrival- 2 people working to check people in. Line of 40-50 people waiting to check in. Thankfully 3 more people came over after 15 minutes to assist. Only took 45 minutes to check in.   Room- okay. They put on the  review that the room has a TV in the bathroom mirror. Horrible picture, 0
We just came back from a trip to Vegas and I've got to say that this was probably my worst experience yet. It seems like the staff is not happy because they act like they don't care for your business. From check in, 0

Thought I woul give this place another try after visiting it as The Native New Yorker & being disappointed.  Was excited that a new place was opening.  A great lace to watch a game... Lots of TVs...if that's all you want to do.  There were plenty of open seats when I arrived, 0

Yelp deal is a big sham. I did a togo of food on a Tuesday night and the guy at the counter says the manager wont accept it. He agrees after I read him the conditions and fine print from Yelp.  An item in my order was also missing. Food is so-so. There are far better places for Indian food around., 0
My bf and I just ate here. We had the beef Wellington, 0
$5 cover on mill is never fun.  This place isn't all that great and I'm surprised they are still around.  Staff isn't always that friendly and drinks aren't usually that great.  For some reason I do have a tendency to meet "interesting" people here so I guess it deserves at least 2 stars., 0
Horrible! We waited in the lobby full of people for over 20 mins for a table. Normally I don't mind waiting but when I look and see servers shooting the breeze and half the restaurant empty well then it becomes an issue. Finally got a table, 0

I have eaten at a multitude of hole-in-the wall taquerias in CA and AZ.  I prefer them to chains as a rule.  I have NEVER had anyone tell me the tacos i ordered are the same thing as the flautas i was served.  Tacos are open faced.  Flautas are rolled.  I didnt want flautas, 0

just Got back from Father's Day brunch!! Waited and hour for a table that I booked a Father's Day reservation for! Food was stale portions were old and not replenished well.. grilled mahi fish tacos were raw taco truck had toppings were baking in the hot sun. Grilled salmon on out  door barbecue was like Sushi gross!!! Scones not even baked and chicken sausage not Cooked well!! No salad bar!!  Serving utensils at Buffet were gross!! No dress code no free mamosas.. no deserts no ice cream!! Worst buffet in Las Vegas!! Sandwiches and deli meat left out for hours!! I'm praying I don't get food poisoning from this horrorshow!!, 0
Snotty staff. Closes earlier than posted hours. Manager sent us to another restaurant that was also closed when we arrived., 0
First stop in AZ on our way to Wigwam. Service was lax - seemed to be more concerned with getting ready for dinner. The cook would come out and sit at the bar when there were no orders to drink her soda. Food was ok - nothing to make you go back. Lots of tv's so we considered going back to catch a ball game., 0
I was sad to see that El Picante had closed and been replaced by Taco Tio. But since El Picante was good and I was already here, 0
Didn't like the salsa or the chips - and that's a pretty important component of Mexican food. They were kinda rude to us as well... although I will say they were attentive and informative. I guess it's just that they had us feeling like we weren't good enough to eat there. They were pretty strict about substitutions too - as in, 0
If I could give less than 1 star I would. This shop was recommended to me by a co worker when I was out looking to purchase my first road bike. I went in expecting to have a great experience but walked out vowing to never go back. I went in looking to spend between $1500 and $1800 for the bike and was told that the only bike they had was over $2000 - above my budget and that I would just have to order the lower priced bike, 0
Under new ownership is not a good thing.  Used this store over 18 years with no problem.  Three weeks ago took many UPS packages and some special US mail items to them.  All the UPS Packages went fine at the right price and on time.  Package to California via U.S.P.S. they charged $17.83 and then they only put $2.75 postage on it.  Was returned to us ten days later.  We went to their store again and was told they would pay to have it delivered the next day.  After getting home we checked the tracking number to find out they did not send it next day.  It did not get there for four more days.  1.5 Ounce 1st class conformation requested mail we had them send to Atlanta.  It has been 22 days and still has not arrived and the tracking is stalled on line.  After making calls to the U.S.P.S. we have found that the UPS store sent it media mail, 0

I always go to/stay at Wynn when i go to Vegas. And I go pretty regularly. Not after this time though.   The bell people scratched my limited edition bag and when I called to file the complaint they asked if I would be willing to let someone come to my room "right now" to get the report. I said ok. 30+min later still no one. I had just arrived for my ONE NIGHT trip so it's not like I had plenty of time to casually wait around for them. I called again and finally someone shows up. I asked why they didn't come when they said they would. They fed me some bs "we had a medical emergency" line. Oh really? For a property that big you have just ONE guy handling medical emergencies and guest property damage? I work at a hotel myself and know this is not the case.   so this security guy is inspecting my bag. He's sweating up a storm while wiping his sweat with his bare hands and then proceeding to touch my bad repeatedly, 0

Terrible food with horrible ambiance and high prices.  An omelet is not supposed to have a browned egg crust on it.  Another diner in the group said her crepes were barely warm.  The Paris hotel tries to have an atmosphere of Paris in their decor and then blasts the same 80s pop that every other casino uses.  Hey, 0
Just walked out of the Dunkin Donut; totally disgusted. Female employee with long dirty blonde hair putting up fresh vanilla frosted donuts.

i used to go here all the time when i first got into eating raw fish. ordered take out for a sashimi platter and sashimi salad. the fish was not fresh and the portions for the platter were way too tiny for the price of $10. sashimi salad was a little on the spicy side. if you like sushi, 0

This place has an identity crisis and needs to decide who it is and fast - cafeteria or full serve ? gourmet or processed fast food pizza ? right now it's using "some" canned ingredients .(pineapple / tomatoes etc.) and "processed" (powdered parmesan etc.) toppings - they are displayed on shelves and I asked about them.  Also, 0

"Easy Relax" is this a joke?   This was the most painful and excruciating chair massage I have ever received. I sat down for a 15 minute massage and I immediately knew I was in trouble.

I'm torn! I should give this place 1* but gonna give it 2 instead. The first time I ate here was for lunch. I had one of their lunch specials - shrimp in lobster sauce or something like that and the BF ordered crispy chicken without whatever sauce they slather over it. All was mediocre. The servers were nice & friendly and the space was clean. I really wanted to like this place. It was close to home and finding a conveniently good chinese place is a heaven sent. Not too long ago I got sick. I was craving for a nice bowl of Wor WonTon soup. I called in the order for two people (not for the BF but thinking of the next day -- so selfish!). The BF picked it up on his way back from the gym. I was extremely excited to dive in this "broth of life".  It was far from bringing me back to life. The broth was flavorless! I could do hellah better with packaged ramen!! There were... hmmm... let's see... all of two wontons in the whole soup. Glad the order was for two: 1 wonton for today, 0
The food is great but the workers here must not have a certain structure to follow. You would assume first come FIRST SERVED. That is not the case here. We have been sitting for 15 minutes just to receive apple juice for my daughter and sister.   Definitely love the food but for the amount of time you spend waiting is just not worth it in my book.   Especially with an antsy 3 year old it's almost not worth the money. I could have had a nice crepe whipped up over at IHOP for half the price and half the wait time. Put my order in at 11:22 and it is now 11:45. This is just one wait that is a bit too far stretched for me    I will only come back if this place gets more staff on hand to deal with crowds big and small.   Actually   Upon waiting 30 minutes(luckily my mom called so I have the call log to prove my wait time) the owner and server show nothing but disrespect. My daughter finished her apple juice in the waiting period. I noticed other patrons that arrived after me already finished and walking out. If you make a mistake and forget a customer, 0

THIS GYM SUCKS. I saw on google that there are more than 500+ complaints about their contract that they make you sign.  Their contract is so unreasonable and scamming. They're such nazi's about how their contract works and are so douchey about it too. I tried to freeze my membership and they tell me i should've give them a written notice a month ahead. And then since I'm calling on the 1st day of the month, 0

Nice staff and great clothes but HORRIBLE return policy.  No returns after 14 days.  No exceptions.  I won't be buying there again., 0
Needed a burger and a beer so thought I'd check this place out.   Sat at the bar and the service was pretty good (got a beer quickly but then had to ask for a menu).   As mentioned the tap selection is ok but nothing to write home about. Bottle selection is decent. If it was my place I'd have more on tap and have bigger west coast beers (especially with "beer" in the name) but I'm a Seattle/Portland beer snob kinda guy. I'd give beer selection 3 stars.   Place gets one star as I bit into my burger only to find out that it was basically raw (not a little pink but blood red). If you are selling burgers they should always be cooked through unless the customer asks for it to be cooked differently. If I want e-coli then I'll ask for it. Ate my tots (which tasted as they had a grease filling)... Server notice my barely touched burger and asked if it was ok. Told him it was raw to which he replied he liked it that way. Yeah, 0
Wow. What a turn around. This place used to be great. Now it seems like it has turned a corner. All of the games are broken and steal your money. The whole place is now dumpy and unclean. I saw the owner yell at some guy for doing a slap save (a pretty normal move in the pinball world.) What a psychopath., 0
Don't bother and fly away...that's my recommendation!!!!   My girlfriend and I Picked up a sandwich from next door (JImmy John..not bad) thought we would complement it with an order of wing.

We were looking for a good Italian restaurant because our kids were craving pasta while on vacation here in scottsdale. We tried veneto and were overall unimpressed especially considering the prices. We don't mind paying close to $20 for good pasta but we felt what we got was pretty bland and not very fresh or authentic tasting (we are italian). My husband had the orrichiette and I had the pasta with eggplant. My husband requested hot oil or peppers but the only had the dry pepper flakes available (blech). Our kids just had plain spaghetti in a tomato sauce (they charged us 13.95 for each).   Service was ok but ambiance was setting was really dated.  There was a stale odour when we walked in. Maybe it was the carpet. The place is in need of a major Reno. The dim lighting must be hiding more wear on tear in the restaurant. I would not recommend this place or return., 0
Walked in here during the Super Run on Water Street and received a Special Super Run Menu. We paid $47 for 2 meals with 2 beers. Side of salsa = $5. Soda = $4.

Tourist trap in downtown Scottsdale.  Beau and I were in for an awesome pizza experience.  What we actually got was:   1. An antipasto that competed only with Costco tasters.

This is a very expensive steakhouse in Las Vegas that runs out of STEAK (as well as 4-5 other important menu items) & doesn't even apologize sincerely.  It was only 8pm and not even particularly busy. Epic Fail. There are plenty of great steakhouses in Las Vegas. Good luck!, 0
I have been to other Topless pools in Vegas as well as some of the other regular pool lounges and I am so sorry to say this one was the worst experience ever.

Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of "are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else"  Yes, 0
Such a disappointment :( I was really looking forward to eating here after finding it on Yelp!  My son & I came here today for lunch after his doctor's appointment.  I skipped breakfast because I was expecting to have a big lunch.  I ordered their lobster roll which came with fries & coleslaw, 0

i ate here on saturday night for a friends birthday, 0
The food isn't something to rave about but it's edible. I love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves. I have only been to (C)Ritters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when Pittsburgh's finest come out to play. Never a dull moment., 0
We went here and it was very disappointing.  My HUSBAND had the vegetarian skillet and the veggies were cold with a very sad melted cheese on top. I ordered pancakes and Bisquick makes better tasting pancakes!!! I will never go there again and the sad thing is we live down the street.  Ugh never again!!!, 0

I really dint care for this place. the music was blah and the out door seating was lame.The only cool thing i saw was the big unit. A home wrecking size weenie some old man was trying to deep throat., 0
I have bought a car at carmax in LA when I was younger and feel like the location was much better on quality on cars in stock. I am looking for a commuter car for my husband and we went to the Henderson location. My husband is a body shop manager and he was surprised by the vehicles they had on the floor. A lot of the vehicles on the floor and outside had noticeably been painted or had overspray on them. By all means I get these are used cars but the prices seemed way high considering the mileage and/or that they had been in accidents. The employees were helpful and the location is convenient off the freeway. Overall, 0
"Not a cadillac place"  I see there is an online deal for this place. I was tempted to purchase that deal because this studio is so close to my home. Then I remembered how I emailed the studio a few months ago to set up sessions. I received one email from the owner but the conversation ended there - Mira Pilates didn't respond to any of my follow-up questions seeking specific dates and times. I was even willing/wishing to pay for private or semi-private sessions! They lost my business then and I can't bring myself to try again, 0
We ordered from this place for the first time. We ordered 2 hot dogs, 0

Great atmosphere but the food was not good at all. The brisket was undercooked and tough. They try to cover that fact with a ton of bbq sauce. It sucks for the staff there because they were pretty good. If you want a motorcycle atmosphere with cafeteria food and Harleydavidson prices, 0
I have to say my visit to the flamingo was not a pleasant one by any means. the only positive part about our stay is it was in the middle of the strip, 0

I've never been to an On the Boarder before- but I was in the mood for Mexican and I was at the mall shopping with a friend -so we didn't want to go too far.

Blah food in a dark and dismal atmosphere leftover from the 80s or 90s at best. Reminds me of the Old Country Buffet chain ... but at $20 for lunch. Poor drink service. Why can't they just have a self-service fountain? No real seafood in sight, 0
I completely take back my original 5 star review and apologize to anyone who wound up eating here recently due to it..  As you can see from my previous review I really loved this place. We come to Vegas probably every two months at least and have made it a point to eat here at least half the trips and always recommend it to friends who ask for places to try.   So fast forward to this weekend- we haven't been to Vegas since this summer due to a lot going on in our lives so felt a little "out of the loop" on some new stuff happening on the strip in between this time. I guess one thing we missed was this place getting new owners and chefs. I happened to browse yelp before we headed here for breakfast today and noticed how terrible the recent reviews were but shrugged it off because I had been here so many times I thought I knew what to expect.... How wrong I was!  I really hope the new owners read and take all this recent negative feedback seriously- I cannot believe how much they are shunning and insulting their fans! First after being seated we were told about the new water policy ($2/person for basically tap water in a bottle- apparently to "save the environment and bla bla" but it screams desperate for as much money as they can take from customers and cheap).   That kinda pissed off my boyfriend but we went whatever and tried to order- boyfriend asks if he can order the $20 steak and eggs but substitute the home fries for something else and we are told "sorry we have a new chef and no substitutions are allowed".... "Even if we pay extra?".... "No sorry". That was the final straw.  We told our waitress (we had already been served coffee) we would finish our coffee and go somewhere else to eat. She wasn't surprised and was pretty honest about how upset so many customers have been due to the new policies and completely understood our feelings- so the 1 star is credited to her nice service/honesty.   I have eaten at restaurants that don't offer substitutions but they are either extremely cheap or high end with quality ingredients and creative menu/dishes the chefs don't want the ingredients compromised on. The fact this place- which is basically a Cheesecake Factory with more flare-- has the nerve to act pretentious like their Denny's quality over priced steak and eggs dish is too good to have a substituted side dish is ridiculous and insulting to the customer who wants something healthier with their entree.   So never again and definitely won't be recommending this place anymore to anyone- which is disappointing because we really did like coming here. However, 0
I support local artists and small businesses. I told all my vegan friends sbout this place as soon as I read about it.    I finally went with friends this Sunday to check it out. We stood for 15 min waiting for a table. The restaurant seemed to be very understaffed, 0
Was this restaurant featured on a show from the Food Network??? I never would have guessed based on the big sign outside, 0

Great pizza but we found a stink bug in the salad.  It would have been better to find the bug before starting to eat the salad but it was found at the end.  The manager generously took the salad off the bill.  Gee thanks manager for the free salad we appreciate it.  Waiter was great, 0
Stopped in today and saw that the Wii games were all on a display that said 14.99 or less. I picked a few out. Hey, 0
I will never eat here again!! We waited 20 minutes for our table and then we were finally seated across from a table with 2 small dogs at it. They were sitting next to their owners being fed just like it was nothing. We got up and asked a waitress since when are dogs allowed in the restaurant and she replied with she thinks they are service dogs. I have never seen 2 chihuahua sized dogs be service animals and the fact that the credentials weren't verified was disturbing.  We were so disgusted we left immediately!, 0
Isn't it amazing how "one bad apple" can spoil the whole bunch?! I had a bad experience with one employee at Budget at the Charlotte airport and now will NEVER rent from Budget again thanks to a bad attitude and inability to simply be nice.

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  Went here for my birthday; there were seven of us.  Six of us got sick with one going to doctor and being diagnosed with viral hepatitis...that comes from employees who don't wash hands after restroom use and transfers bowel or urine remnant to the foods during prep.  That then resulted in acute pancreatitis.  Missed work for a week and a half.  Most miserable week ever!  Do yourself a favor...DO NOT EAT HERE!!!, 0
Outside of the view . . . well it is just too contrived.  Given the pricing I would expect more . . . like maybe a table cloth . . . like maybe if you sell me a beefsteak tomato salad how about some beefsteak tomatoes . . . not grape tomatoes, 0

I posted this three time on the Jiffy Lube website and never go a response.  I guess they don't really care I have used this  location for my four vehicles for almost thirteen years.  I liked the fact that I saw the same friendly faces and received the same great service every time I went in.  I rarely had to ask them for anything special as they knew how I liked my cars taken care of. However recently there seems to be different people each time I go there.  I understand business have personnel turnover, 0
Check your change!!! I came here late night and ordered a drink. Paid with a $20 bill and after getting the change and the drink was backing out of the spot to drive off but thought the bills seemed a little light and that I should count them. I did and it was short $5. I pulled back in and as I was pressing the button for service, 0

Levi's Outlet--WASTE OF TIME!  I was so excited to go to the Levi's outlet since I need to buy extra long jeans and paying retail is just too expensive.  I've purchased them at other Levi outlets and we scored Huge but not here. First of all this shoud be an extension of the trendy 20 -ish type of stores. We are in our 40's and my husband is 6'6' tall and we were trying to find something in a 40 length. 501's or something in a loose leg.  Nothing came close to that and the waist sizes were only for the young and very fit. My husband would NEVER wear skinny jeans nor would I let him UGH! Since I've purchased the last 20 pairs at a Levi's outlet I was determined to find a pair. This store, 0

This place is horrible horrific and just bad! My cat was in an accident and this was the first place we went to after the animal ER was closed. My baby a tabby cat was looked over by the Vet...1. who first did not introduce himself. 2. Told me he had maybe got hit by a car and had a broken jaw. (We could tell his jaw was broken) 3. No emotions. ...said he needed an xray to be sure then possible surgery. The x ray is $186.00 up front! I asked if we could work out a payment plan and his answer was no and my 2nd option was to put him down. There was no empathy or sincerity! It was best choice to have euthanized so he would not suffer anymore. He was in really bad shape. Then came the choices .....I felt like I was at a department store and anything and everything was and upgarde. I have never been through something like this and there was just prices thrown at me. A paw print and for me to be with him was like $60. Plus everything else...just a shame. The vet assistant (Stephanie) was a lot more sympathetic and did get me a paw print on a card and is going to save him so I can possibly pick up his ashes n a week or so. I understand that business is business but our pets are our family.  A little caring goes a long way. I thought people became veterinarian because they loved animals. R.I.P my Henry., 0

Horrible customer service. My fianc\u00e9 ordered dinner. They delivered the wrong food and then continued to tell me that my fianc\u00e9 ordered something different. I was sitting next to her when she ordered moo shoo (don't care about the spelling) chicken. Chicken and broccoli. Shrimp lo mein. All combos by the way with egg rolls. Fried rice pint. We received chicken n broc. Shrimp lo mein. 2 pints of white rice and some weird looking chicken stir fry. I called to tell them the mistake and the lady who answered the phone told me my fianc\u00e9 ordered chicken gung kung pow or some bs. I was like no. We ordered this. And she told me I was wrong. I continued to say we ordered combos and she told me no, 0

This "resort" is on its last legs. The rooms are spacious but old and with a slightly moldy oder. The room service was late and the omelette was greasy. Worst of all: no hot water for hours in the morning. The front desk apologized but wouldn't refund anything because I booked through Expedia. That's 4 star customer service for you. I know it's cheap for the strip, 0

Im starting this review in the bar bc service is that bad !! This is the first time I've called a manager over to the table bc of bad service ... I recognize its the bar area but paying customers are paying customers ... period .... we had to ask for refills several times ... she seemed visibly annoyed when we asked for steak sauce ...

I do mostly take out - and eat in rarely but I do 2-3 times a year and noticed... Totally hit or miss here when you do take out.  It seems that you get less food when you do take out - I have noticed you definitely get less veggies and less meat.  Never order 'extra' of anything - you have less than a 50% chance you will actually get anything worth the $1 or $2 you are paying.  I order extra veggies and get like 2 or 3 broccoli pieces.   I only get food here when there is a Bogo, 0

To paraphrase the late great Clara Peller: "Where's the lobster?!" I am referring to the absence of edible lobster in the Lobster Mac & Cheese ($14) that I ordered as part of our $150+ meal for two. There were exactly 4 tiny pieces of cartilage from the claw-point of the lobster (I always discard this part when I eat lobster) and it seems that they throw that crap in there to trick customers into thinking there's actually lobster in the dish. Even more maddening is flipping through the channels in our room upstairs and stopping on 'MLife TV' to watch Hubert Keller himself describe the 'most comforting American food' being his signature Lobster Mac & Cheese - he then chops up an entire lobster tail and tosses it in his mac & cheese skillet.  The Onion Soup ($6) was oddly thick and tasted really bad-for-you like it was made with lots of butter. The Crab & Avocado Sphere ($9) was pretty good, 0

Horrible ER experience!  It is unfortunate that those who have health ins are treated so poorly when it comes to asking for help.  My husband took his 80 yr old mother in for the second time due to a severe back condition that is in the process of diagnosis.  After two days of not sleeping and being crumpled on the floor my husband took her back to the ER for help and to ask for an MRI.  They told her flat out no and asked him why they were there in the first place.  The Dr. was extremely rude and condescending.  The nurse admitted to insurance red tape and the reason for not allowing the MRI...They were there for 6 hours and she left with a morphine injection.  Terrible terrible place!  Unfortunately we are often restricted to where we can go in an emergency.  Just be aware that this facility is not where you want to go if you are looking for comfort!, 0
Came in here for drinks. Extremely weak -- obviously trying to rip off tourists.  My husband had a Jameson and ginger I tried a sip because I hate Jameson and I didn't even cringe. I had a long island iced tea which was in a pretty small glass (for almost $10) and didn't even feel a darn thing. When he went up to ask for a shot or something he got into some kind of weird altercation and we left. Tourists beware, 0

We found a LIVE WORM on one of the dozen house oysters we ordered. I'm no oyster connoisseur but I would imagine a live worm is unacceptable? It was still wiggling on the edge of the oyster shell. I'm guessing that means it's as fresh as can be? Another thing to note is most of the oyster shells didn't look like there was any attempt to clean or scrub them before opening as they had dirt and grime all over it. All management offered was a refund on the oysters, 0
Let me first say how delicious the cornbread was!  The catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet). The yams were out of a can so that was a major let down. The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.  Seems like a tourist spot to me. The staff was friendly and I liked the crowd I didn't get a chance to try the homemade cakes although they looked pretty tasty.  I can at least say that I tried this place :), 0
We always used to stop here whenever we were reasonably nearby (it is a 30-minute trip) despite waiting in long lines in the heat because it was worth it. Yes, 0
How can this place even be considered a place to eat. The food is horible. We had to return our dishes for being cold. There was actual wilted lettuce that could'nt even be considered food for turtles. How can you mess up French Fries?, 0

my wife and I have been coming here for years. today we went with friends. maybe three tables seated and we had to wait a long time for service. when our drink order finally came we had to wait forever to place a food order. in the past the pizza was good, 0
NO BODY EAT HERE!!!  Let me tell you first i work in the restaurant industry as a Chef so i have alot of give and sympathy when it comes to mess ups and waiting for food.   However this was redicoulouse.  This little caesars is horrible! I ordered 1 order of crazy bread that is supposed to be hot and ready. Which they were not.. so I sat and waited. Bread can take no more that ten minutes I have time. I thought to myself. Fifteen minutes goes by and they serve about eight to ten people. Messed up orders or lost orders left and right there is no communication pertaining to the food or restaurant at all. They also lost a mans deep dish pepperoni. And another familys light sauce pizza. Obviously they are not ready for a rush because there was always a five minute wait on hot and ready pizzas.. At fifteen minutes I finally spoke to someone about my bread and the cook put an order in. And I watch it go thru and sit at the end of their conveyor for five to ten minutes while they talked and horsed around the kitchen doing nothing pretaining to their job. I finally got up and walked to the register and asked if I could talk to a manager and get my money back. Finally they say ooo they are up and almost ready.  The two cooks in the back are slow and have no idea what they are doing. I watched people touch their face or their phone and other things and I never once saw one employee wash their hands in the 25-30 minutes  I waited for my crazy bread. This place needs a new manager and new employees. The only bright light was the girl at the front taking orders Lindsey I belive. She took orders and was very kind to people. I even herd her remind the cooks of my crazy bread four or five times. If I were the manager this place would be way different.  HOT AND READY means the food is done when you arrive.. if I could give this place negative stars would be perfect!, 0
One star is generous.  This place was godawful. Maybe it was because we went on a Thursday night, 0
Horrible service. Manager lady lacked intelligence and customer service skills were awful.  Decided to not ship after completing transaction and she claimed there's a $5 refund fee although there were no signs stating of such policy.  DO NOT USE THIS STORE!, 0
Never again! Went for my birthday, 0
The service department needs a overhaul. I do not even know where to start., 0
Loving pizza I would not say this would be my choice.  Tge restaurant had a nice feel. Nice music.  We order there house favorite.  We were not our favorites the oven is very hot that makes the bottom of the pizza get chard but the dough itself is a little chewy and it got soggy very quickly the sausage could have been cooked a little bit longer. We order the sea bass. It was ok nice crispy skin.  But under a cold salad.  No thank you., 0
We went in here for dinner. We were the ONLY people in the restaurant. There were at least 5 employees behind the counter eating, 0
My bf and I went to Pho 87 on Friday at noon before heading back to the bay area. We were shocked at the price for a bowl of pho---$9.50 for some and others were more than $10, 0
NEVER EVER coming back here again!!! They did my tax, 0
lets start with your parking choices. Valet up by the front door with the disabled parking or climb up the mountain from the bottom lot. Sounds bad but I was thankful for my Mom's disabled parking tag.   I do have to give it props for atmosphere (do people give props anymore?) the view is great, 0
This place is so forgettable, 0
Can I give it a zero PLEASE OH PLEASE YELP?!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  I asked the hostess about happy hour, 0
Ewww...this was my second try at Viet Bistro just because it was convenient and I was nearby. I will not make that mistake again. I've tried their Pho and like others have said...it taste too cinnamon-y or weird...not authentic AT ALL!! I like Pho So1 and will not stray again. This time I tried their Bahn Mi...the bread supposed to be light and fluffy but it was stale and dry and the pork was disgusting. I didn't think you could mess up Bahn Mi/Vietnamese sandwiches, 0
My husband and I have seen a few other adult shows in Vegas and this show is the only one that seemed sleazy and made me uncomfortable.  That was mainly the fault of the crowd, 0
Be careful of what you eat. 8 of us went for lunch. Two of us had the brisket and we got food poisoning., 0
Unprofessional and more concerned about chatting with each other than taking my order.  (There were about 10 JJ's staff there when I arrived, 0

Service was fine but the worst corn beef hash I have ever had. Really ruined the whole meal. The server was polite but didn't seem to know what to do. There are so many better options around here., 0

Why do I give this particular McDonald's a one? It's poorly run, 0
Ok.just got done eating my take out . 1 . I got Laab for appetizer it way to salty .and I thought  was it supposed to be sour not salty. 2 . Pah Thai tofu its ok . 3 Pa Nang beef once again too much salt .the flavor is not to bad .  I definitely will give it anoyher try next time . May have to ask them not to put to much salt ., 0

Used to be my go-to nail place. Today I was treated poorly and lied to. Was told one price and charged another. My big toe is throbbing right now because of the half ass pedicure. Paid extra for callus removal... clearly still rough skin on my feet. Not happy. Will not return or send anymore business their way., 0
The customer is NEVER right.  That is what the manager of Scottsdale branch of Chompie's  seems to believe. We asked for a refund on our chicken noodle soup and were very patronized and told how wrong we were. Despite diluting it with a quart of water the sodium level would not reduce. Once wonders even what their sodium product was. He gave an explanation that even defied basic cooking and patronized us greatly. We were/are very offended and will never recommend this place to others. We were treated horribly and will never return., 0
We selected this restaurant because we had a gift card to use for our date night and on a Friday, 0
Our waitress was super nice which is the reason I am giving them 2 stars basically for the service. The food was nothing worth going back to eat. My omelet was gross but the potatoes were like chopped cubed french fries, 0
Run! Run away as fast as you can!!  Wow! One of the worst foods I've ever had. Really. It was so bad, 0

This Pizza Hut location has poor customer service!  This last time I called in to place an order the guy seemed overly put out to even answer the phone let alone take my order.  Sorry Pizza Hut, 0
Should have listened to the reviews!! My husband ordered a margarita and it was just not right. They brought another one and thou it was somewhat better it still wasn't good.  I ordered the never ending pasta bowl and at first I chose the whole wheat fettuccine Alfredo which was extremely dry. So for the next order I tried the regular fettuccine and this time it was creamy but flavorless.  My husband's food wasn't the best either. So I guess we won't be coming back to this one!!, 0
Where do I begin?! I'll start with the fact that I'll never waste my time on that joint again. We visited McFaddens at about 4pm on a Monday afternoon. Not exactly a busy time of day. There were approximately 4 tables sat in the entire bar. We were the fifth and they sat us behind a pole in the back of the restaurant. Apparently, 0

I gave this place a 1 star because zero isn't an option. I have received poor service here on several occasions and didn't want to visit tonight but I was out voted by the rest of the family and didn't want to make a separate stop. I ordered the Tendercrisp. It was cold and hard, 0
Did someone set off a smoke bomb in here??? Wow.  So, 0
Life's funny.   Not HaHa funny. Just funny how you can go back to the same restaurant fifteen months later and end up ordering the exact same meal, 0
My boyfriend and I went out on a thursday night for a last valentines day celebration at DPOV. Everything started off nice and were really enjoying the view and each other... The place started getting busier and our team of servers began stopping by less and less... By the time we had gotten our entrees they were pretty much nonexistent. Our food was just above Luke warm and our wine was empty.... After about 30 mins of waiting for some one to come over one of our servers came by to clear our plates. He didn't ask how our food was and didn't offer any dessert menus. We aren't really the complaining type but considering the price of the food my boyfriend got up to discuss our issues with the manager whom removed the entrees. This place really needs to improve their customer service skills. We decided to go to one of our favorite places for dessert. The  Rokerij. We won't return or recommend this place., 0
Nope. Don't go. Overrated overpriced. Super long waits and the biscuits are terrible., 0

As much as I like to shop at Nordstrom Rack I am very disappointed with the misrepresentation or there credit card. I was told I would receive $20 on my first purchase and $100 worth of alterations. None of this is true. Turns out you get coupons that are like cash. That's fine but that is not how it was explained to me. My $108 purchase cost me $148 after alterations that they make you pay for and then send you credits. However I never got the credits because I canceled the credit card. Way to go Nordstrom Rack. I will never step foot in another as long as I live., 0

Gave it four stars last time.  Food and service has gone down hill since then.  The specials are absolutely atrocious and old standbys we used to like are lower quality.  Skip this place., 0
It's a sandwich place. Average bread. Average sandwiches. I doubt if they make their own bread there. Went there for breakfast sandwiches and they didn't have breakfast ingredients.

Sat down and waited 20 minutes for them to notice me and give me a menu.  25 minutes later they didnt come back to take my order.  Some people came in and got their take out order immediately.  Been to this place several times before and this is by far the worst service i have received.  Will no longer come back., 0
The online bargain wasn't worth the wait just to check in! We have been standing in line for over 30 minutes and I am maybe halfway there. At least at a restaurant they tell you the wait time and you can decide to wait or not. With a hotel reservation, 0

This was clearly and bluntly a disappointing experience for an allegedly three star restaurant. My wife and I have experienced far better restaurants that were far from being hailed as the navel of French cuisine but certainly better in terms of quality of service and quality of the food. Spend your money elsewhere in one of the countless other signature restaurants in town, 0
The service is horrible.  I go in and sit down at a table.. I am not only completely ignored for about 10minutes, 0

One of my only disappointing meals while in Montreal. Stopped in around midnight and had a friendly guy help me interpret the French menu. I decided on a burger and poutine under the guise that it was $6.50. My French sucks so I apparently misunderstood the guy/menu and my bill ended up being like $9 instead.  That wouldn't have been so bad if I a) got good service, 0
I work for a towing company here in town and one of my friends just called their insurance company to have their car towed.  Seeing that the insurance company doesn't give you an option on who tows you car and it was my day off.  When the towing company finally showed up 2hrs after requesting a tow.  It took the driver 3 TRIES to back up to a car that was parked straight on a residential street.  I had to show the driver the hook up points on the car so he could winch it onto the truck.  I watched him for at least 20 mins under the car trying several different hooks and he had no luck.  I would never use this company for any type of towing or road side assistance based on this guys lack of experience., 0
The food at Dragon Noodle is actually worth 3 stars, 0
Be advised - reservations are not reservations - they are merely a suggestion..  I had booked a non-smoking room in the tower only to find out upon check in that they did not have the room that I'd booked.  The reservation means nothing if they've already put people in the hotel rooms you've 'reserved'.  I had heard people say that the Luxor was a dump, 0

The worst burger I have ever tasted in my life.  Very dry and tasteless.   I had never been to Fuddruckers before and I will never be back.  Dirty tables, 0
The restaurant was dirty. The tables were all crumby even though they were all empty.  The floors needed a power wash. The ceiling was leaking water down the wall into a dirty garbage can. The guy behind the counter was stuffing his face the entire 25 minutes we were there and talking with his mouthful to incoming customers. My stomach was turning when I noticed that he never washed his hands between eating and serving. I was also disappointed with the taste of the pizza. We could have ordered Dominoes and I would have been happier. I won't return for sure., 0

I came here today about 5:00 for some food and a drink. Sat at the bar for close to 10 minutes before the bartender came from the kitchen. I ordered turkey on a croissant with fries. Fries were not cooked and sandwich barely had anything on it. Didn't even eat half of it. Bartender was extremely nice.  That is when I found out they scheduled her to tend bar and cook at the same time. I will give it one more try. Hopefully their food will be better, 0
This place is a gimmick and a joke. The food quality is similar to Burger King. The fondue was an embarrassment. Save your money and go to Dairy Queen. Service was terrible. I was told the Sugar Factory near the Paris was better., 0
Man I do not know what happened to this mall but every single store that made this mall is gone! Probably only stores that remain that's been there since day 1 is foot locker and Sears! Everything else is gone.   They have a pi\u00f1ata store! Like seriously, 0
Had to wait while they tried to fill up the shuttle departing the airport but it gets better.  On the return leg they no showed our 5:20pm pick up and we had to call to be put on the next shuttle which was in one hour getting us very close to missing the flight.  The driver told dispatch that he stopped but no-one was there.  Gray line was everywhere, 0
These guys are CRIMINALS! They recently decided that they do not rotate tires if they are remotely worn. What really? Oh you mean you don't rotate tires so I have to buy them more often from you guys. So if they won't rotate them because of this new usage rule shouldn't they give me new tires (mine are less than 1 year old) so I can start following your NAZI rotation guidelines. SHAME ON YOU DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!!!, 0

I seem to have made a mistake by ordering a gyro here.  Not only did it not feature any lamb but the slices of beef were entirely too large to eat gyro-style.  The taste was fine but it was a pretty basic gyro.  I've had better from a cart in front of Central Park.  Meh is a good word.  The lemonade was way too sour.  What's with the trend of the sour lemonade lately?  I shouldn't have to add a pack of sugar!   I will give this place another chance and order a cheese steak meal next time but the gyro is crap.  Also, 0

I have been at Laser for less in Scottsdale twice. The second time was about a week ago and I was burnt. Now I have 4 dark marks on my skin. I went back to the place and they told me that they might have applied the laser too high and they gave me a cream to apply it to the damaged area but it is not working. I am going to wait a few more days If the marks dont go away I will seek legal advice .  Laser burns should not happened. Definitely I do no recommend this place to anybody. Technicians seem to be too young and lack of experience, 0

The Deuce is the worst public transportation I have ever taken. Every stop seems to take 15 minutes for people to load and unload. It was a painfully long ride from the strip to downtown.

Okay. I'll start off with this. I have been going to the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge since it was Patsy's. Over 25 years. I absolutely was thrilled to see this place at Boca Park since my wife and I just moved from the Big Apple in July of 2011. This review is based on a visit in Sept of that year.   The only thing this place had in common with the original Grimaldi's is the name. Sad. I don't remember much, 0

Now they are CLOSED!    Figured as much., 0
My husband and I got takeout last week... Decided to try something new. We ordered the meatball appetizer and got a meatball sub...meatballs did not taste or look homemade. Pizza crust was too chewy...also did not taste fresh. Lots of good choices in N Las Vegas --this isn't one..., 0

Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm.

Extremely over priced for crappy work. My skin had more acrylic and gel on it then my nails do. My nails are thick and they look horrible. The polish and gel look chipped and warn an hour after I left  as if they we're done a month ago. I went in for a fill French manicure and gel cover. They charged me $28. My fingers itch so bad. I will never go back. Giving them 1 star is 1 to many., 0

Circus circus was the most dismal attempt of a hotel I highly suggest you stay as far away from that smokey dump. The staff are as rude as they come and don't get me started on Nora she is the slowest blackjack dealer in the world but not as slow as the waitresses that take 3 hours to get you a drink. The wifi is only on selected levels and that's just as slow Nora. It's so far away from anything good you may as well spend the extra few bucks on a better hotel. Overall this place is hell and you should never pop Molly's  here because those demons will get ya!!, 0

My wife and I eat out five nights a week.  We know what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to ambiance.  We booked a table for the patio...and dropped German's name as he is the Gran Fromage.  When we arrived...on time...we were told no tables on the patio.  We were given the choice of a table in the bar ...or a table in the dining room. Given that the noise level was so pronounced in the bar...we opted for a dark table in the dining room. We sat down, 0
Worst service and managers. Make other plans trust me! Took 3 times to get a drink right and over 30 minutes, 0
What a crap hole of a hotel.  My friends and I drove straight from LA and arrived in Vegas at 6:30am. We wanted a cheap room for a few hours to rest...I searched online and the cheapest was this place.  Long story short...we took all our luggage to the front desk and they man behind the counter was acting extremely rude and wouldn't give us a room for the price vegas.com had listed. Nor was helpful to let us know if I did book it online real fast how long it would take the transaction to actually get to him. He just kept acting like "oh, 0
The quality of the food here was decent, 0
I haven't been here in years.  First I found the super buffet at Cactus and Tatum and they were good.  A lot better than New China.  They eventually closed down.  Then I discovered Shanghai super buffet at Bell Rd. and 42nd Ave. on a trip to the west side.  Now Shanghai is locked up tight with a notice on the door and their phone is out of service.  So I stopped at New China on the way back and was as disappointed as ever.  Their selection is weak, 0

Blue Martini is definitely a place to go on a crowded Friday or Saturday night if you want to people-watch in a sort of meat-market atmosphere. Many of the women wear tight, 0
Wow! This place has gone way down! First of all eating sushi in Arizona is a horrible idea! Where is the ocean and how long do they leave the sushi out?? Between the loud music and fairly attractive staff, 0

I've always enjoyed eating here but today's service was so poor that I felt compelled to inform my fellow yelpers.  We waited for more than 10 minutes after being asked "what type of meat we would like" and actually had to ask a total of 3 times.  One of the diners in our party found an object (glass or plastic) in his lobster bisque and upon bringing it to the manager's attention, 0
It wasn't the greatest food. They fried the onion rings with the fish. The prices was way too high., 0
They sold me two nightstands that were broken. After having the technician take a look at them they determened that they needed to order replacement parts. 1 month later I receive the parts. I call the customer service number and they said they would send a technician out on my next day off.. Nobody shows up. After I called they said that the representative made a mistake because they dont service my area that day.  I reschedule for my next day that I was available (about 5 days later) I specificly advised them that It needed to be before 2pm because I had a shift that day. I get no call and nobody shows up. Then the tech calls at 3:30pm and said he was at my front door. WTH!!!!  I'm going crazy with this company I work for a living not stay home and wait for something to be fixed that was should not of been broken in the first place..Now they want me to call the day before just in case I dont get a reminder call. I NEED MORE FURNITURE FOR MY HOUSE BUT I WILL NEVER EVER GIVE THESE BROKEN OVERPRICED AND NO RESPECT FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS PERSONAL TIME!!!   PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE! THANKS!  Hopefully they fix my two nightstands that cost me $499 each!, 0
There was a time that this was a great Qdoba location. Went in today with my family and was overall disgusted with the level.of service & food. The place was a mess. The drink area looked like someone was setting it up and just walked away. An open container of sugar was sitting there with the lid to the sweet tea open as well. The trays that the food are delivered smelled awful. I don't think they have been actually cleaned since the place.opened, 0
Customer service was bad enough that I feel compelled to write a review which I have never done before. The plumber came out and repaired the problem but left our water shut off at the house valve, 0
Disappointing!! DO NOT BOOK IT! There are SUPER loud bars right under the rooms! I asked the front desk if we could change a room because it was too loud and impossible to fall asleep. the woman of the front desk went to talk to the manager, 0

Definitely not worth our time. Luckily I got our tickets for free on showtickets4locals.com. Performer although energetic he had about 16 participants which half of them he barely did anything too and the other half looked like they were faking their performance and just messing around anyway. Pretty much one of the participants was the whole show. Small theatre so all seats are a good one, 0

WAY overpriced.  it's definitely a great place to enjoy exotic and unique taste. I've been to few high class restaurants, 0
Compared to the other locations this one is the nicest and biggest.  Although as nice  as the location is the customer service is lacking.  We have never had an issue ordering Garlic & Butter clams (simply garlic & butter) At this location we got it with the Cajun spices . When we asked the server about the order she stated they do not have a Garlic & Butter selection. My boyfriend didn't want to make a fuss so he was just going to eat it. The manager came over to explain the spices and was slightly condescending but she agreed to fix it and give him the the g&b sauce. OK problem solved...when the clams arrived the manager handed them to him and spoke to him like he was a child and again explained if  you don't specify that you only want g&b you will get the Cajun as well.  He bit his tongue because he was about to lose it.  I was kind of taken back by her tone as well.  When he started eating there was so much garlic that it as difficult to eat.  He was so over it and angry he  just did not want to talk to anyone. He felt it was done on purpose because it had to be remade.  I'm still not sure we will visit this location again as the Spring Mountain Locations have never given us any issues.  We hope they get it together and learn how to talk to customers in a respectful manner., 0
The staff is friendly and attentive. Too bad the food is so limited and not too impressive. There's some good items, 0
You gotta read up on this place before you go. I've been to a few day clubs and none of them are as complicated as this!! It took at least fifteen mins from the check in counter to the actual pool.. There are two other check-in's after! First was to get in, 0

Was approached at a concert regarding Sears Vacations so I gave them my email address and phone number. Was called a week later to come check them out and told I would receive a free week resort vacation and $250 trip cash. I went and sat thru the boring sales pitch. Basically you can pay $3000 for the opportunity to pay "wholesale" vacation prices thru their travel agency. I decided I would have to think about it and would base my decision on the free 1 week vacation they promised. Turns out, 0
Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else. The wait is not worth it. They had over 10 tables open, 0
A little pretentious.  Service was good.  Atmosphere and decor were nice.   Caprice salad was good, 0
I have very strong feelings about this hotel.  Probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed in with the exception of some gross shack of a hotel I stayed in during a visit to Key West.   I have nothing good to say about this hotel with the exception that the beds were comfortable. We stayed here for a convention and we had our room and flight expensed. This was not our choice but I was still looking forward to it as I have never stayed at the NYNY. Check in was extremely frustrating. We were given 4 different sets of directions by 4 different workers to our elevators. The elevators are not clearly marked or distinguished from the other towers (there are several sets of elevators). Seriously awful planning on the hotels part. I think it took us 1/2 an hour to find the right set of elevators.   The room was on the 33rd floor and when we arrived I noticed that there is a pink film on the window. It gives a weird red hue during the daytime and makes the room look even smaller and darker than it is at night. There is no source of natural lighting in the room what so ever. It's like a tiny outdated bat cave.  As a  woman, 0
Our family of five with three children just had their flight canceled today for non-weather related (ie mechanical) reasons. Very unaccommodating with our rescheduling and hotels. Certainly not family friendly given our 3 children under 5. They wouldn't pay $10 extra for a crib for our infant at the hotel they arranged. We have 2 additional flights tomorrow. It's like our traveling has not even started. I would not fly US airways unless you were going to save hundreds of dollars on the ticket. In the end you'll just end up spending more when they cancel your flight., 0

Utter garbage and one of the worst places I have ever dined at. It is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant/bar that it pretty difficult to find. Arrived at 6:50PM and there was one waitress/bartender and one cook.  I was not greeted upon entry and ended up just sitting down. The waitress was either playing with her phone all night or talking to the gentleman at the bar, 0
Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, 0
Don't bother. Unless you enjoy eating large balls of rice with tiny fish on top. I get that rice is the way all you eat sushi can make a profit but this place takes it to the extreme. We came on a Saturday and the place was dead. There is a reason why., 0
Great views over Edinburgh castle but that's about it. I'm only here because it's late on a Sunday and raining outside. There are so many independent cafes in Edinburgh with better coffee, 0

We have been to this place a number of times over the years. Frequently it is to take advantage of big screen TV to watch a game.  I never thought the food was great but our most recent visit was something of a low point. My wife's prime rib sandwich seemed unusual and she suffered serious indigestion the rest of the evening. My sliders were ok. In the past I thought it was more than bread and meat. I got mustard for my sausage. My spicy green beans were good. Our table for four received its food in four deliveries and some food wasn't hot. Not sure if it was a kitchen problem or a server problem. Service was pretty bad.  She was nice and pretty but not effective. Normally service has been pretty good. In this case drinks were delayed or forgotten. Part of my food order was forgotten. Our waitress was also absent for considerable time.  The restaurant was about half full. Perhaps someone didn't show up. This visit a decent place turned into disaster scene. We liked it before and probably will again but this was a timely reminder that bad things sometimes happen in good restaurants., 0

My truck stalled in the middle of the lot and pep boys just happen to be there thank god. But when I asked for help to check my battery and a jump the service reps where not in any rush to help I waited 30 mins when no one was busy. The service rep helped 5 other people after me. It took for me to stand in front of his counter  to even get his attention. He looked at me with frustration and then asked another associate to help me and they all said no. So this rep had an attitude with me the whole time. When we finally get to my vehicle he hooks up everything and  tries to start my car then just gave up and said I don't know what's wrong you will have to take it to the dealership. What the heck!!! I mean u work for pep boys where u can help fix cars?!? Then he just left me there with no solution. I ending up calling a tow truck and had it towed to another local auto shop that was also nice enough to take care of the towing fees.. What's the point of having service reps that don't serve you? Horrible service all the way around.. Next time I'll make sure I stall out where there is an auto zone.., 0

Big ups to Rob for getting me and my 8 lady friends in for free with no wait.  This is the only reason this place gets even two stars.  The Samoan body guard and the big black body guard was funny too.  He was really messing with us that night.  He made my sister say "LET ME IN YOU BIG SAMOAN MF" before letting us in.  Random yes - but whatever.    Music was bumping outside and the scene from the camera outside looked like the party was bumping inside but it was so not.  The big screen TVs showing the video's of the songs the DJ was playing was cool.  Super crowded with a bunch of folks that could not dance.  I know you usually get a bunch of folks that can't dance in every club but this was like 90% couldn't and it was just awkward.  I mean even the gogo dancers did not know how to shake what they mama gave them.  We left after 30 minutes and boy were we glad we didn't pay to get in to seek out a better club., 0

I knew right away this Buffet is NOT MGM's top priority after I saw 3 kinds of fake scrambled egg dishes.

All I have to say about this hotel is that I don't think I will ever be staying here again.  Maybe I'm just picky but this place was very dull.  You go to any casino on the strip and you'll find it a lot more busy and rowdier than over at Monte Carlo.  Not to mention the not-so-friendly staff who took all of my gambling money.  Okay, 0
Wade came out to fix my broken AC after my home warranty company sent him a work order. He looked at my unit and reported to my home warranty company that he ran my serial number and that my unit was part of a factory recall. The home warranty company refused to fix it and also said they would not cover the unit because of the recall.  I called the factory rep myself and asked them to check the serial number. My AC was never recalled.  I called Wade with this information and he maintained that it was defective. He still insisted that he had checked the serial number. It took me four days to appeal his report and get my unit fixed, 0

I'm not much of a fan of buffets so not sure how objective my review can be but I thought the food here was lousy. Nothing sets apart this buffet at Paris Las Vegas from any other run of the mill you can find just about anywhere in Vegas.   The food was really subpar. I didnt find any traditional french dishes in this buffet. It was your typical buffet garbage. Prime Rib, 0
The treatment I endured here was so atrocious it made me activate a Yelp account. I initially came in for a prepaid interior exterior detail package that included a wax.

This place is too trendy for its own good! My party of four walked in d w bistro around 12:30 hoping to indulge in the bottomless mimosas and a fulfilling brunch. We were quoted a 45 minute wait time & told by the host that we could start at the bar and as long as we had our glasses at the table they would refill them all day. The four of us retreated to the bar where we fought to get attention from the bartenders for a solid 15 minutes. Once we got the attention of a bartender we were told that they were no longer selling mimosas. Another guest commented that they heard the bar was out of glasses so we continued to wait for other tables with glasses to leave. We then tried reordering mimosas and were told that they were no longer selling them as it was after 1- even though a bartender had just given a new glass to a guest that he appeared to know.  We went back to the host stand to clear up the confusion as we had already been waiting for 30 minutes hoping to get a drink. The host then checked back with the bartenders who told her the same thing she had told us. No one apologized for our wait or the miscommunication so we left disappointed. This visit was particularly upsetting because I was visiting in town from LA and I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here because of the excellent yelp reviews. I can't attest to the food but the service is a NO., 0

Never once has my prescription been ready when I'm told it's supposed to be.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm told it's going to be 10-15 minutes. I don't have time to sit around and wait with two kids in the car. I so wish I wasn't pigeon holed into using this pharmacy. I miss Walgreens!!!, 0
I was unhappy right from the start. They only had one person working and we were standing in line waiting for him to get off his phone and take our order. The food was very average. Stale bread and brown avocado. They also didn't have the sandwich I wanted but only told me once they had brought my husbands food out. It was way too expensive for what I got. There are so many great places to go to for lunch and instead I decided to try something new and give this place a chance and I regret that choice. I will never go back there, 0

Do not try to sell to this guy. Here is his deal. He sends his fiance (I have no issue with her as she seemed professional) out to your house with some insulting low-ball offer. I gracefully declined the offer and told her I did not appreciate the offer and we parted ways as friends. Not even FIVE minutes later I get a simple text from Matt saying "GO FUCK YOURSELF." Horrible "business man" that should not be trusted in your home.  PS - the 4/30 review is by his fiance. Sad that he had to have her write a positive review for him., 0

My wife and I stopped in for dinner and we both were less then pleased with both the food and service. The salmon skin rolls were horrible and my wife could not even eat two.

This place is the worst customer service check out ever! It is  12:00pm Sunday and you only have two people ringing? Ok I'll give you maybe people call in sick. Me and 20 other people are in line waiting. Then your manager on duty is laughing and joking with another associate, 0

This is absolutely my least favorite place to eat and drink at Town Square. I was disappointed in so much here I don't know where to even  begin. Two visits and still I'm not impressed.

Everything from the paint and cheap wall hangings and furniture is unappealing to my eye.  Foodwise, 0

Someone actually gave this place five stars? Kill yourself.  I'd rather eat the dead raccoon from hot tub time machine than subject myself to another shitty piece of sushi from Sumo Sushi.  I'm grouping this in the same league as Inaka (Blue Diamond/Cimarron), 0
This paper is awful and its internet version azcentral.com is even worse. I will glimpse through the web-version solely for the purpose of reading local news and might pick up a physical copy for the crossword. It does, 0

Just wasn't what is was made out to be. Won't be back. I can make better tacos in my backyard., 0

I have been battling Liberty Mutual over a $73 charge they sent to a collection agency for a renter's policy on an apartment I had vacated and no longer had a lease on more than 6 months earlier. Liberty Mutual not only did not process my request to have the insurance cancelled, 0
Gosh what can I say? We went to this place with very high hopes of having some great food..and God willing service. But alas..food that we ordered was sriracha chicken wings..and roasted chicken..the one and only poultry dish for us chicken eaters. Wings..well the sauce and cucumber ranch although a little runny but ok. Chicken ..well..we had to struggle to eat these so called wings..they were that hard and chewy. Roasted chicken...hmm..I'd say this one was ok..but all I could taste was butter ...butter and butter. Did I say there was a ton of butter..? I had to add some pepper to it to add at least some type of flavor to it..and still it tasted pretty much bleaah ! Oh darn...I almost forgot the service..it was terrible! The place was half empty..yet the waiter had to be reminded twice..to get straws for our water, 0
We went during restaurant week and we were very disappointed.  Maybe they mass produced steaks to feed the masses, 0
Music and dancefloor are ok.  The service was terrible!! Tried to go to the bar to get water and two bartenders walked by...one getting ice and the other went over to shoot the breeze with one of their friends...stood there for 20 minutes with no acknowledgement.  The venue is fairly new...I never made it to Gilley's at the frontier so I don't know how it compares. Overall we had a fun night. The bullriding was entertaining, 0
The doctor side of LensCrafters gets 5 stars. Always impressed with them and will continue to go there for the doctor and staff.   However. I've found the retail side of LensCrafters to be a complete rip off. Ever wonder why glasses are ungodly expensive  here? YouTube: luxottica 60 minutes. Apparently one company (luxottica) owns pretty much everything when it comes to eye where, 0
Ordered to go and they had you wait standing by the reception desk, 0
BUY RAT TRAPS WITH YOUR TREE. The Christmas tree we bought last year may have infested our house with RATS!  Our problems started shortly after buying the tree, 0
Family and I went out for something we thought would be a meal we cant make at home but were we wrong. Chicken tenders were COLD! Waitress took them back to the kitchen for maybe 3 minutes and they were unevenly warm and i assume because all that they did was put them in a microwave. Sauce was slathered unevenly and everything else on the table has gotten cold by this point. Refills are hard to come by but the worst disappointment was the food that should represent BWW. Frozen, 0
It's my first time here and the only thing I was impressed about what that the establishment is located in an old gas station.   The people working here are not too personable when talking with customers. I understand they might get tired of doing that for 5 hours, 0

I can only surmise that Outback Steakhouse's ubiquity in America stems from the fact that the average person is either too lazy or too ignorant to realize that a good NY Strip can be prepared for half the price and in half the time.   I'm quite certain that at no point did salt, 0

I went to the Speedee on Pineville-Matthews Rd. many times for oil changes over a four year period. Nothing special...an oil change and possibly tires rotated. I am perfectly capable of doing this myself, 0
I went during the CIAA and I hated the food.  The staff was okay. I agree with one of the other post they are too busy trying to date the customers. The best thing about the place is the structure.  I give the layout 5/5 the rest of the place a zero but you would not let me rate it that low.  KEEP YOUR MONEY IN YOUR POCKET For this place., 0
Pretty disgusting.  It smelled like an ash tray, 0
A freind that lives in Vegas recommended this restaurant. We went on a Saturday night and the place was not busy. After we were seated on the patio we waited for about twenty minutes for a server, 0
Today I had to wait toooo long for the chit chat to end with the cashier and a talkative customer.  Socialization is fine but with six or so other employees within sight it didn't fit the Starbucks image of efficiency.    Two different employees punched keys on the second register in front of me and then walked away assuming the other register was soon to be freed up... Maybe... ???  I finally got my usual tall Pikes Place so all is well that ends well so to speak..., 0
My family and I have visited here multiple times and each time a different bad experience. My hope for this review is to hopefully encourage Management to make a few changes. I also want to stress that I am all about home grown businesses and LOVE to support them.   Here are my experiences: 1. Out of dough at 6pm! We have visited on a weekday as well as a weekend and 3 times they have ran out of dough around 6pm. The crazy part is it wasn't busy.  2. Raw dough pizza. Every time we visit one of us has to have our pizza sent back to be extra cooked due to it being under cooked.  3. Lack of staff knowing menu. This sounds strange but we have came and ordered items on the menu that the staff there did not know how to make. I am discouraged to order anything but pizza because of it. 4. Cleanliness. Everytime we visit we have to ask for our table to be cleaned.  I have given Queens multiple chances and unfortunately I think I am going to have to pass on visiting for awhile., 0
From arrival there were no employees no where in sight, 0
I wouldn't recommend this place.  The grounds are beautiful but nothing else.  No respect for the religious order that are taken there., 0
Drink was okay, 0
How can a fellow Yelper rate this as a 5 and me a 1? Maybe it was an off day?  This place is absolutly beautiful!   The service was average to slow, 0
One word to describe the food at Diego: INTERESTING. Personally, 0
This place is okay. I honestly didn't like all but one dish I've ever tried there (I've tried 4). The good dish I had was pancakes. Not even that special. I once went with a friend, 0
We have a condo in vacation condo in downtown Phoenix.  Have tried Cibo's on 4 occasions since 2009 because friends keep telling us how wonderful it is.  I really do not know what they see in this restaurant.  We are still looking for a place that has a decent pizza!  The wait is usually long hard to find parking and service well service needs some work!  We have had to sit for at least 10 to 15 to even have the order filled.  The pizza is a small artisan style pizza with a little cheese thrown in places and well no taste.  I had sand in my salad and told the server.  She said, 0
Came in today for VIP  wash.  It was just ok.  Outside of car is fine.  Inside I have a grease stain on passenger seat, 0
Ok. But a little to salty and tuff for our tastes. Long line up takes a good qhile to get served. Long drive from the strip, 0

First let me say the young lady behind the counter was great!  I'd hire her away if I had a job for her.  That being said, 0
I ve been twice and haven't liked it either time. The lines are crazy long and by the time you get the food it's not good! The hummus come like water and the meat has been undercooked both times! Won't be back sorry to say!!, 0

This pub has won serveral awards but in all honesty, 0
I have NEVER written a review in my life but the service with Showtime was so bad that I felt super compelled to write one. Waited for over 45 mins. to get a shuttle. Several people got fed up and walked off the line. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this terrible company!, 0
PT's Pub is a chain in Vegas. Some are nicer, 0
Everyone makes a big deal about this place but their service sucks at the restaurant and also on the to go windows. The only reason we went back was because we liked the desserts and nachos but when we ordered nachos they said they didn't have some so we asked for chili cheese dog the girl also said we dont have that either. How can a very known place like this not be well stocked. I was very disappointed i dont think ill ever be going there again., 0
The coffee here is shit. The owner rolls his eyes if you speak English. Gee, 0
I kind of have a thing for Tiki Lounges (if you do too, 0
Costco has great prices and merchandise and for the most part the employees seem to take what they do seriously with two notable exceptions:  1.  The gaggle of "managers" who stand around schmoozing in the aisles preventing customers form getting around them.  When you have to ask employees to move you know the store has an attitude problem   2.  The people who deal with the shopping carts are unsafe and rude.  They feel their function there is above all others and that customers are an annoyance.  I get it.  They're heavy and its hot but don't yell at me because I'm in the way and in a foot cast.  If they worked for me and behaved that way with customers it would be their last day.  They are unsafe and ignorant., 0
I stayed here last week because it was such a great deal and learned my lesson the hard way. I started getting bit on the first night and it got worse on the second night. I realized they were BEDBUG bites once I was home and had already spread them to my house. I submitted an incident report as soon as realized what happened and after not receiving a response or callback, 0
Sat there for 20 minutes and no one come and take order. Enough said!, 0
sucks their drink ladies literally run around like blind Helen Kellers notice how I said "run" thats because they do. I think they are having a marathon as to who can do the least amount of work. On two occasions I made eye contact with the drink ladies and said "right here" and waved my arms. Apparently they thought i was shooing them away. 4 hours gambling and not a single drink or a chance despite our best efforts to do so., 0
Went last nite and it was awful. We go once or twice a month, 0

Do NOT go here. The bartender told me the burgers are done just right with a little pink on the inside. Mine showed up charred on the outside and 100% RAW inside. At first they tried to play it off like it was supposed to be a little pink and didn't want to admit their mistake.   If you're in the mood for incredibly expensive burgers, 0
First time at the Mirage and it was alot better than I thought it would be.  The only real fault I found with this place were the food options were super limited. There wasn't a great variety and everything was way pricey. Planet Hollywood is still the better option in my opion. They have a ton of food/drink locations with comparable rooms at a nearly identical price. Mirage was good, 0
I can't understand why anyone would like this place.  I saw the comparisons to Crazy Jim's and Pita Jungle so I thought I knew what type of food to expect.  Oh, 0

Just spent 98 minutes (phone has timer) with Cox due to no Internet connection.  To keep a long story short I talked to four people and appears the second person could of taken care of the problem.  Since I just retired from a job where I took abuse on the phone I was nice.  I also had sent e mail few days ago regarding the cover being off the Cox box  in yard and I received e mail indicating I have to be home ....what the heck ?!  Good grief.., 0

What a joke. I ordered three 8 inch meatball subs but when we got home they were all 6 inches.  Rip off.... too much money for a crappie deal., 0
I can't stand shopping here. Seriously! The check out line is ridiculous (and with all the candy and beef jerky they force you to stand next to in hopes of an impulse buy, 0

This isn't the worst one I've been to in Charlotte but definitely not the best.  I had to toss my own ceasar salad(no modifications either).  Not the way things should go when paying $7 for a salad.  At least it was Tuesday and a free kids meal was included., 0
Unimpressed is the best word to describe this place.  Normally a long line of people waiting is a sign of a good restaurant, 0
I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food.   Both had good beer selection, 0
I went there once and will not be back. I ordered the steak fajitas and was disappointed firstly when the plate came out as just a plate and not a sizzling entree as per usual with fajitas. However, 0
I used to love this website company...Until I realized that they removed customer reviews. I used to order their Vitacost branded Raw honey and I have ordered it several times. But the last time it was a totally different kind of honey. I emailed them and even called them after waiting for a while. They admitted that the honey was a different kind. So I asked for a refund. Nothing happened, 0
I ate here because it was one if the few restaurants in the strip district that was open after 5 on a Saturday. I ordered 1 vegetarian burrito, 0
I just got off the phone with Jennifer to let her I need to cancel swim classes for a student.  I told her they just pulled my money out for 135.00 for the month of July.  The student is moving out of state in an emergency and wont be able to attend anymore classes.  I was told by Jennifer nope sorry no refunds.  You have to cancel by the 15th of the month.  This emergency was not planned.  Thats why its an emergency.  I also reminded her that of the three classes she missed due to illnes I was promised to be notified of any make up classes.  Not one phone call to make up any classes missed.  I would have settle for some compensation for cancelling but she flat out said Nope.  So if I were you and youre thinking if signing up dont pre pay.  They will keep your money for not working for you., 0
Wasnt really feeling it. If your in the neighborhood I guess it's worth it but don't make the drive. The food was just okay the service was really good but couldn't redeem my  tummies disappointment. I was super excited about their bottled fanta too but sadly it was flat. Just sad and flat :( Not worth the gas to go back. Everything was just ok I really thought the yelpers had my back on this one but I guess you get led astray every once in awhile., 0
Okay buffet as far as Chinese buffets go in Las Vegas. NV can learn a lot from NY about Chinese food and especially buffets. In North Las Vegas this is your best option as there are not many of them. They do have Sushi but not the freshest I have had. Last time we ate my daughter said the crab legs were very gross, 0
Lorenzo's should be ASHAMED of themselves!!!  I am pregnant expecting baby any day now so I thought I would make lunch easy and have some pizza delivered.  I didn't want to go on the cheap with something like Domino's (though hindsight being 20/20 I probably should have) so I ordered from a local small business, 0
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! SAVE YOURSEL THE HASSL.  So disappointed, 0
We enjoyed the beans and cole slaw very much but no one in my family likes the taste in the burger.   It was very overpowering.  The beans were a bit pricey.  The place is cute but small.  The kids were unhappy that there weren't fries.  The menu was very limited and we probably won't return because of the strong taste in the meat.    We are eager, 0
Stopped by to have labs and there were 4 people waiting. 30 minutes after I signed in I asked how much longer, 0

I've been to this location twice in search for work shirts in specific color and style. Both times I've been beyond disappointed with service. For once I wish I remembered to save my receipt for my first purchase and checked to see if I could do a survey online or phone to voice my opinion on how mad I was when the girl who had just started gve me complete wrong information and the second time the manager I'm assuming who was short and had long black hair had me so confused and just looked at me the whole time like I was stupid. I hope the district managers or something reads the yelp reviews and does something to fix their employees brains somehow and gets some knowledge on their damn products. I've never been to a store of such a higher quality material and left so baffled and astounded by their lack of knowledge. I dare anyone to ask the staff at this location if they have any idea what any products online might be. They will give you that dumbfounded look where they just stand there for minutes where you basically have to tell them never mind ill figure it out on my own like I did. Geezus. Never again will I go to this location unless they get a grip on their stuff., 0
I know my friends like this place.  But to me the service was lazy and veryy slow. Gnats flying all around, 0

I rented a high end bike for a day out in the canyons. I paid top dollar to ride a well maintained high end bike.  That is not what I got.   During my ride I kept hearing a rubbing sound and the bike shimmied a bit at high speed.  I'd get off and spin the wheels but couldn't replicate the noise.   They have an annex in blue Diamond luckily.  The mechanic there Was great by the way.  He looked into it and discovered the front wheel was actually loose and would only wobble with my weight on it.    He also pointed out the rear tire was down to the cords and replaced it. The rear d\u00e9railleur fell off when he took the wheel off as it was missing screws.   This is what you expect when basically paying 2$ a mile to rent a 6500 dollar bike    I thought I was reasonable to ask for half my rent fee back and they refused and. Ant be bothered to return email  Zero stars, 0

Came to this Chili's a few time. Usually it fine but the past 2 time we went the service sucks. First walking in there was no one around to greet you.  We stood there for 20 mins. They claim there are so busy but they have plenty of empty tables. Took forever to get someone to take our order. After our food came out no one came back to refill our drinks or give a check. I had to wave down a different server just to get our check. This is horrible service. I live around the corner and we will never go back here again., 0

What a disaster!!!   I mean that in a literal way.  From start to finish this race was a safety hazard for thousands and thousands of people.  Massive crowds that were poorly managed...dark streets in seedy areas with huge potholes....few bathroom facilities along the way (saw more than a few men peeing in the street)...a debacle at Mandalay Bay that was so horrific I saw little babies crying because they couldn't breath in the crowd.  What happened????  This was a fabulous race last year but this year was unforgivable.  I won't be back., 0
Just coming out of the movie theatre and hungry with no clear idea of where to eat.  Cafepino was an easy choice so we wandered in for our first experience.    I liked the atmosphere, 0
Been here twice . First time we waited 20 min before we was asked if we wanted a drink. But the food was good but very over priced. So we thought we would give it another go this time we went as a small group. They got the orders wrong the food had no taste . This  place is very over priced. This place is only still open because of its location . Wouldn't go back ever, 0

Got transferred to manager named Linda to see if I can pick up my photos after the portrait place is closed. She was rude and unhelpful. Did not let me finish my question and kept saying portrait is closed. I know they're closed at that time. I just wanted to know if any staff can get my photos or do I need someone from portrait to get it for me. Gosh. How do you get to be manager if you're customer service is that awful?, 0

The service was just terrible. Half the time we didn't even know who our server was. My friend ordered vegetables saut\u00e9ed with NO butter and olive oil instead but got a bowl full of vegetables in a pool of butter.   The view of the strip is amazing from here though., 0
The service here is incredibly inept.  Our order was messed up several times and sent back only to be messed up again! A simple taco salad with no tomato turned into an hour long back and forth ordeal. They  left tomatoes on, 0
The barley soup was the saltiest soup I have ever tasted.  Salads and hummus plate are severely overpriced.  If I ever come back, 0
I have to give the staff at this store credit for dealing with the flood of crackheads that visit this store on a daily basis. That being said, 0

Terrible experience.  Went for a late lunch around 3pm today. Checking in at the hostess stand was normal but it wasn't a good vibe. All the employees seemed very stressed out.  We were told it was a 5 minute wait and we were seated within 10 minutes.  We were seated directly next to a giant table of children. As a well dressed modern couple with no children in tow of our own, 0
Very poor service, 0
Simply the worst wings I've ever tried in my life.  Just awful.  They were rubbery (do they cook them in a microwave?) and small.  The "butter" garlic sauce was some sort of petroleum-tasting margarine that even my dogs weren't excited to chomp on (and they eat their own poop).  The lemon-pepper wings also had a very strange artificial taste to them, 0

Overly-Hyped Sh*tty Operation.  Very disappointed and won't be returning.  My friend and I were excited to have a drink after a horrible week.  OHSO is right by my house but I had never been.  We walked in and were met by an angry girl with a nose ring (doesn't matter but just for identification purposes) who barked that we had to put our name in for a table and a 45 minute wait.  We were a bit thrown off by her attitude but asked nicely if we could look at the bar to see if there were seats.  She grumbled that there was open seating in the bar. We went into the packed bar and there was not a seat but two girls were about to leave a high top.  We were excited and waiting to grab our long awaited beer.  We were then approached by a hostile brunette server who asked us if we had put our name in with the hostess.  We explained that we were going to sit at this bar table.  She snapped that we had to put our name in for this seat in the bar.  We explained that we thought the bar was open seating and she rolled her eyes.  Up walks nose ring girl.  She rolled her eyes at the brunette (as if we couldn't see her disdain) and says she told us we couldn't just sit down.  I felt like we had committed a crime.  My friend and I were over this unwelcoming, 0

Very salty on everything we ordered and the sashimi was not the quality I had expected.   Could have something better at naked fish for 20% of the bill.  Sashimi was sliced very uneven and simply not too fresh.  Maybe my expectation was too high looking at their price.   The sake here is extremely expensive as well.   Will never come back again., 0
Average slices. Nothing special.  Not sure how much they pay the New Times for being nominated as PHX's best slice, 0
This place is all right. They have an excellent set up for NFL football on Sundays during the season. TVs everywhere and a crowd that is mixed enough that everyone is rooting with someone (or against them). They do a breakfast buffet that is really good and pretty reasonable.   They have a card program where you get stamps for consecutive weeks of attendance during the season. It was pretty cool the first time, 0

So food is great! BUT service OMG slow and no awareness. So took forever to get food when not busy (10 people sitting half with food). Then I wanted to get a to go box. Well I went to front of line to quickly ask for one and cashier Never even noticed me. Was kinda in front of him. Then walking back to my seat a cool came out and sat behind me for his break. Asked him if they had boxes. Told me to go to another counter for phone in orders. Well then I was in line for a while as that took forever. I gave up told my girlfriend how that didn't work by the cool and he didn't even notice. Never checked if I got the box or anything.  So food good, 0
Yeah this place is horrible. I was there on my last night in Vegas and had absolutely no fun here. Paying $5.00 just to come here, 0
I would never, 0
Lots of TV's - Great!  Everything else - Bad!  Seriously, 0
Just picked up food from there. They forgot one order of meatloaf so i waited 5 minutes for them to bring that out, 0
For the first time I stopped by today for lunch and the chef was more interested in talking on the phone than taking care of the customers, 0
Surprised this place has 4 stars! The food wasn't terrible but being next door to such amazing Thai places that set the bar so high (Surangs & Corner Thai), 0
I stayed here once a year and a half ago for work and couldn't remember why I didn't really like it then, 0
I was unimpressed with this restaurant. I will agree the been dip they start you with is very delicious, 0
Hate to give this place a bad review, 0
Perhaps we were there on a really  "off" night, 0
Well I do hate leaving a bad review on a place with such nice staff and warm and friendly owner but unfortunately a restaurant needs to be more than just a bunch friendly nice people. The quality of the food has got to follow. As much as I really wanted to like the food and was hoping that this place could be a good alternative to Firefly, 0
Work nearby and been here a lot over the years. Bagels are great, 0
Eh it's okay, 0
this  place is heinous.  the staff are nice but the food is revolting.  avoid at all costs., 0
We decided to try this place since they have a new location not far from us. According to the reviews and waiter, 0
Today was my first time at this location... The reason I have not been to this location is because they do not carry a full menu. I rather have a sandwich than salad. Therefore, 0
Boring.  The moment you walk in the restaurant is just so plain.  Sure there are bright colors but nothing stood out.  Boring.    So I order my usual pizza sausage and green pepper.  It was ok.  Nothing stood out.  The pizza was ok.  That is it.  I can barely finish this review.  It was not bad, 0
I hope this place decides to invest in a better staff. I was soooo looking forward to some Cajun food, 0
We ate here regularly before the service declined and I was served onions in two visits after telling the wait staff of a severe food allergy.   We decided to go back today after not eating here in over a year. The service was still slow but food was good. Then a quite large "palmetto bug" crawled up the wall...   We won't be returning., 0
Front desk staff is rude. Poor service. Avoid at all costs.  Came in with an on the job injury to my hand and they told me they wouldn't see me until I filled out the paperwork... all 3 pages...  after I reminded them that I injured my hand and asked if they could help they accused me of being drunk.  On top of this they couldnt figure out how to code my paperwork eventually saying there was nothing they could do.   They were more interested in using their cellphones than helping patients. Rude beyond belief and incompetent. This spot is a must avoid., 0
I used to love Outback, 0
ive been going to zia records (the mill ave location) for 10 years now.  Never had a single problem, 0
The food tastes amazing but the portions are tiny and the price is ridiculously high!, 0
Crappy service. Average food. Don't waiste your time and money, 0
Hate clubbing so this is biased.  Sucked balls waiting. We got there at 9:30 when there was like 30 ppl in line. So we were ridiculously  close. However ppl getting tables were going in first. And they were picking all dem hoes in diff area codes so our mixed group had to wait. We were literally close enough to the bouncer to talk to him. My group was right next to him, 0
This place is THE WORST. They have the most unfriendly, 0
I'm not even sure where to start.  Horrible!, 0
Me and my wife are here for 7 nights and I wish it was none. We arrived at this "place" my wife calls the dump at 1am in the morning. We get to the desk only to find out there was a "Resort Fee" that was supposedly disclosed at the time we purchased our package, 0
This place sucks!! The workers there were VERY rude and unprofessional and I got a full set acrylic and there awful. There not straight, 0
The costumer service leaves something to be desired. Was not able to try the ice cream due to the lack of service. I would not spend my money here based on how the treat their consumer., 0
Johnny Smalls gotta big rep, 0
I've eaten here several times over the last couple of years for business lunches.   While the service is usually OK, 0
My husband and I went on Friday to have a couple of drinks and apps at the bar.  We ordered the deviled eggs which were just ok.  The burnt ends, 0
Good food. Lots of T.V.'s for games. Staff was friendly unless you sit at the bar. I ordered 2 beers and they came quick. When I ordered water from 1 of the 2 bartenders, 0
like 9/11  never again, 0
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!  It was my husbands birthday and we decided to order take-out since we have small children and it would be more difficult dining out then eating in.  So I called in to order the take out, 0
Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast with family from out of town. We had a party of 6 and was told it was a half hour wait. We waited closer to 45 minutes. The hostess was nice and told us we were going to be seated next. Another party of 6 came in about 30 minutes after we had got there and the hostess immediately said we were going to be seated at the same time. The other party of 6 was seated first, 0
The first Panda Express I seen with a drive thro. This has to be the worst PE i been to for customer service. Walked in there was no line, 0
I got takeout from Coriander last week. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Aloo Gobi, 0
Two stars for the view and ambience.  I ordered the half slab of pork ribs and they were not good.  Way overcooked and dried out.  My husband had a burger as did his brother.  That was pretty good.  The prime rib my sister in law had was so so.  The salad starter was good as were the cowboy beans.  The corn on the cob was a soggy overcooked mess.  The potatoes were not done correctly (some overcooked, 0
We used to love the food here.  Something happened not sure what?  New cook maybe?  Seafood tastes like it has been on the dock forever.  The fried rice is fried very hard! Nasty.  Carpet and establishment looks very old to be in new shopping center.  Last time I eat here.  One positive is most of the staff are friendly.  I would not eat here.  The very last time my son got sick after eating here., 0
My first time going.....  The waitress looked like she was ready to give birth as she took our drink order. I had stated I had never been there before but she still didn't give me the break down of how this whole grill thing worked. "In her defense she appeared to be the only one working there"   My kids loved it because their bowl's were endless, 0
Would love to the review the food but we've been here an hour and consider ourselves lucky to get an iced tea. On the up side the tea isn't bad......  Hire more servers please, 0
Not enemy 1 star. Had coconut shrimp where's the coconut and can you cook the coating so it is crispy? Shrimp was tasteless. Fish and chips were bad too absolutely zero flavor., 0
Service was awful. The burger arrived 10 minutes before the fries. Shake never made it with the meal. Not a good experience., 0
Was just told that they were out of sushi.... Like KFC running out of chicken. Didn't know that was possible, 0
Don't believe the hype. Started off with the lobster bisque soup of which the lobster was chewy. My friend had the heirloom and barrata salad and it was fairly decent. We shared the ribeye which was a bit dry but bloody if that can even happen. As a side we had the lobster mashed potatoes that had pieces of the lobster shell mixed in which brutalized my gums. We also had the saut\u00e9ed asparagus that never made it to our table but we can only imagine what that would have tasted like.   As far as service our waiter was good and the team that assisted him was good as well. I was disappointed that I had to box my own food for the price I paid but hey it is what it is., 0
If it wasn't for the great service, 0
There are lots of better places than Uncle Louie The Restaurant. The Mediterranean Pizza was good. The salad with chicken was tasteless and the chicken was dry and the lettuce was just iceberg lettuce. The veal Parmesan was burnt. The waiter forgot to place one of our orders. All in all, 0
I would never use these people ever again when visiting the charlotte area. They are rude and their communication levels are unprofessional. Tried to pay them several times by calling bc their website payment plan wouldn't hold up. They never returned my phone calls till months later after I had terminated their services when they noticed the debt. Not very responsible and also made very difficult to keep up my end of the contract. I also found them to be way over priced and not compensating their employees appropriately for all the hard work that they do. If I were you I would find better business people., 0
The service is all around Slow. There is major construction going on and the is no easy way to the Strip. Also all the pools and hot tubs are closed because of construction, 0
I feel bad. Giving a one star. I feel horrible, 0
the burgers are good here like the bourbon burger.  I've had better, 0
Dirty drink glass, 0
I've been to Havana caf\u00e9 before, 0
The location's a little more convenient, 0
I came here on my first trip to Vegas when in college still and on a very tight budget.  A group of 7 of us paid $190 for nonstop air and hotel so for the price we couldn't beat it but it is pretty run down and not really on the best part of the strip.  I have been back to Vegas several times since and unless your on a very tight budget I wouldn't suggest it.  If you are though Imperial Palace is the same price range with a better location.  As for the tower that was pretty cool going to the top and going on one of the three rides that overhangs off the 1000 ft ledge was very neat., 0
all i can say is they cut g's bagel. i was explicitly clear in my order: one plain bagel as it is. no cutting, 0
We were excited to try this place based on all the great reviews.  I had the cheeseburger and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger.  We were disappointed, 0
It's 10:16 am they just opened... The check out lines are long- elderly people scrambling to find a place to stand in a busy, 0
I don't understand the hype behind Fausto's.   I've tried the Chicken Quesadilla, 0
I have been going to Dona Maria's for such a long time. I had to stop a few years ago while I was pregnant with my son because I had friggin nose like a bloodhound and could smell EVERYTHING when I walked in. No matter where I sat, 0
For a cheaper price, 0
This place is a joke!  We stayed at the Caesar Palace for the 1st time and while waiting for our room to be ready stopped by for a bite to eat. Well the bite to eat took about 1.5 hours; though there were only about 4-5 tables occupied (about 1/3 of the place). We ordered a turkey burger and a regular medium done burger. 3 tables were sat after us, 0
The location is nice, 0
Holy F balls, 0
It was our first trip to Weary Traveler on Saturday, 0
I have eaten at America's three times. The first two times the food was good, 0
I would give them zero but it's not possible. Never coming back to this location. Again hostess are royal cu##s, 0
Service is usually slow and the food is meh., 0
Ive taken Stella ( my english Bulldog) here 2 times & there were only 1 other dog. But, 0
What in the world?! How does this place have such positive reviews????   Staff - SLOW, 0
Late review. Will not be going to this place again.  Not a fan.  I ordered simple Milk Tea w/ boba.  Some boba was not soft and chewy, 0
Wow!  What a cluster "f" this was!  Purchased the Def Lepperd concert/room package for my son and his g/f for his birthday.  Through Hard Rock site mind you!  Paid with my card.  They arrive yesterday - panic!  My credit card and authorization was needed for them to check in.  I get emailed the authorization form - copy my id and card - fax it to the number on the email.  Call from my son 20 minutes later - they didn't receive it!  Fax'd again to number on the form - again - not received!  WTF!  Now my credit card & license is floating around that god forsaken town somewhere!  Ended up scanning & emailing everything.  Took my son over an hour to get checked in!  Ridiculous! This was posted earlier this week and hmmmm.....somehow disappeared!, 0
I'm sure I'll get a lot of negative responses from this review, 0
It definitely depends on what you are looking for.  This store was recommended to me by my daughter's soon to be violin teacher.  Unfortunately, 0
Worst haircut I've ever gotten. The stylist cut my bangs way too short and uneven, 0
I prefer Petsmart better because they have a better selection and prices. I like Petco for their cookie bar so I can pick up some cookies that are friendly for pets for my pets. That's basically it, 0
Nothing special and overprice due to this fact. Either prices need to be cut or quality needs to go up a notch. Disappointed overall... I probably would not come back unless things changed. People were nice though, 0
Went to breakfast - nothing special - ordered waffle with strawberries and ice cream, 0
The service was terrible and the food wasn't much better. It took an hour to get our food and my water was empty the entire time. I definitely won't be going back., 0
The service at this place sucks. There was nobody there when we went and it took freaking forever to get our order in.  I ordered the tuna sandwich and it honestly wasn't that great at all.   Their fries arent all that and this place isn't worth the money they charge!  I go to vegas ALOT and I'm never going back here., 0
I am not writing this review to be mean, 0
Why isn't less than 1 star a possibility?  We try this every now and again, 0
Food:  We ordered  1. GU A C A M O L E   C A S E R O 2. C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L 3. T O R T A  de  C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L 4.Q U E S O   F U N D I D O 5. P A S T E L  de  C H O C O L A T E  a la  O A X A C A  All this items were very basic without any interesting or complex flavor combinations except for the dessert.  The flavor and presentation of the food was unremarkable. I think we might have ordered the wrong stuff but there shouldn't be any wrong stuff at a good restaurant.  Also, 0
The parking here sucks big time. Using the self park, 0
Ate here on my second night in Vegas.  I was going to eat at the plaza next to this one, 0
Only 1 person in front of me, 0
What an absolute horrific experience I had here.  Not only did they get my order wrong, 0
I don't know what happened to this place. Service has become excruciatingly slow. Stopped in yesterday at 5:30 and didn't get our food until 6:05. The food is good but don't see going back here due to the lackluster service., 0
Stay away. Overpriced, 0
I really wasn't that impressed my first time eating here last week. First of all, 0
3 for food. 1 for service. Reminder to self. Don't ever tip here again for take outs.  Ordered a pizza, 0
We loved the decor, 0
Perhaps it was the busiest day of the year but the service was horrible. 12 minutes before anyone even came to our table and beverages were always empty.   The sushi was just okay. Feels like due to thanksgiving, 0
If there were less than 1 star, 0
I would not recommend this place to vegetarians. I've tried it more than once just to be sure, 0
Ate there a few weeks ago but wanted to give my review a little distance from my visit for a "cooling off period" to see if my feelings would change, 0
I understand compromises must be made when making cakes without flour (must add lots of sugar). That being said, 0
Most of my issues with this place has to do with the time share vultures involved in my booking.  My wife had to cancel her flight out so I was staying here solo after a work visit.  Because of that, 0
We had just experienced Tryst the night before and my friend and I were excited about trying this club that was featuring Tiesto.  I admit I did not know who Tiesto was, 0
Other than the convenient location to the Diamondbacks stadium I was not impressed. It's continental breakfast consisted of two types of cereal, 0
The Arizona State Fair is more like a carnival.  Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest, 0
This place has really gone down hill over the years.  Every now and then I will give them a chance to redeem themselves and every time they have shit the bed.  Super Nachos and Carne Asada Fries, 0
Went on a Thursday night where there was a 35-minute wait.  Friends asked that we meet them there.  Service, 0
This place was THE worst! We were just walking around gambling and these huge dude's with ear pieces kept trying to get us to go to "Their New Lounge" they kept hounding us that there was no cover till midnight to hurry and get in. We finally gave in and saw tons more bouncers waiting with nothing to do. There was an empty red carpet and 0 line we walked in and it was dead we figured it may have some amazing original drinks or some shit. They were out of at least one ingredient from every drink on the menu....coincidence, 0
BLAND!!! No flavor in anything. Don't waste the walk from your car inside. I've had better Mexican at Taco Bell. The best part of the meal was my diet soda. After our plates were cleared it took over 20 mins for the waiter to bring our check. Not recommend AT ALL!, 0
This location badly needs new equipment and a complete remodel. If you go to any other LA Fitness in the valley you will know what I mean. For the location (near Paradise Valley) you would expect more. Equipment is constantly broken, 0
Service sucks!  I cant believe service can get this bad.  We got seated and was super hungry.  All the server tries to ignore helping us but 1, 0
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR SO DON'T EXPECT MUCH HERE!  i paid $80 total including tax for 2 nights here on a weekend and the only reason why was because how cheap the prices were! its by the in-n-out but basically almost on the strip. it's only a minute drive to the MGM!  the cons about this place is the flooring. it's tiles which is pretty weird. the showers are small and somewhat dirty. the toilet seemed old. i felt that i needed to put a seat cover every time i needed to go pee! they had a nice new sink and was nice because they had good lighting for putting on make up! to turn on and turn off the tv you had to pull the plug out which was RIDICULOUS! the WORST part was that the door seemed like it didn't fully lock. it wasn't secured enough. THEY NEED TO FIX THAT!  the only pro was the bed. it was HUGE and had clean white sheets. we didn't use the comforter tho...  if you need a blow dryer you can give the front desk your I.D. and they will give it to you back.   GOOD LUCK TRYING TO GET A TAXI. THEY ARE NOT AROUND HERE. SO I SUGGEST YOU DRIVE. THE TAXI NUMBERS DON'T WORK AND THEY DON'T SEND TAXIS OUT THERE EITHER. SO SAVE YOUR TIME AND JUST DRIVE., 0
If you're looking for cheap food that comes in generous portions, 0
Went for lunch around 11 am on a Saturday. Not too busy. Sat at the bar. No one approached us for the first 5 min or so. Finally the bartender, 0
Something just didn't feel right while watching this show...  Could it have been that I didn't know what the point of the show was? Could it have been that there was no story or premise to the show? Could it have been that I got bored seeing the same set of boobies from the same five girls? Could it have been that the show was performed in what looked like a conference room with a built-in stage? Could it have been that the room was not even half-full? Could it have been that I wasted $29 to watch this show that did not titillate my senses? Could it have been that one of the girls had a chest that was as flat as a board with what looked like two Hershey Kisses as nipples?  I would have to say a big emphatic "YES!!!" to all of the above., 0
Never ever again ! First off our server brittanylooked like she spent all her off time in a tanning bed . Tanerexic much? She was young and stupid. When I first got there I went into the bathroom, 0

Buyer Beware. Purchased DOPO tablet at walmart.com Plus the extended warranty. Tablet stopped working about 2 months after it arrived (didn't use it that much either). Then it took 3 months to get the return shipping label from the third party Walmart uses. A buddy who purchased a larger version of the same tablet had a similar situation; he ended up having to call 4 times to get the label sent to him. The third party then sent me a gift cirtificate that I couuld only use to purchase items at a Walmart store (according to the manager at the store). My buddy and I lately found other online options that are more reliable and trustworthy. What surprised me the most was the time needed to solve this issue, 0

I made reservation at this steak house because it was my son's bday and I wanted him to experience fine dining .When we arrived to the restaurant the hostess was very rude.  We were staying at the Mirage. We are VIP guests at the hotel.  We got to the lobby a bit early so we decided to get a drink at the bar. We asked the bartender if we are allowed to take our drinks to the restaurant and he said yes, 0
HAIR! Found multiple dark hairs in my fries. Thats just nasty. Service sucks. Seems like the kids working here are are more interested in socializing then taking care of customers. I will not be returning., 0

Worst sandwich I have ever had from any place ever.  So bad it pissed me off after 2 bites of yuck that I didnt eat the rest.  The meat is beyond gross with all kinds of salt and preservatives and other chemicals added.  The quality to me was something like the cheapest deli meat you would find in the grocery store but not from the deli.  You know what I am talking about.  Mystery meat., 0
This had been my favorite mexican restaurant for years....But things have changed. A couple of weeks ago, 0
Not really a true brewery... It's a small room inside the 4 Queens. The "brewery" is offsite 7 miles away.  As a home brewer the beers were nothing I couldn't make at home myself... Maybe I should talk to 4 Queens and I could get a brewery! LOL Unless you just want to check another "brewery" off your list... Not really worth checking out., 0

After 6 weeks of a broken AC unit in the gym I again asked DJ the club manager why it has not been repaired and it should not be taking this long. I was yelled at by DJ and told repairs will be done with they get done and if I don't like it to find another gym to workout at. I have never been yelled at by a manager as a paying customer when I question anything. His job as a manager is to field questions and concerns of his paying customers without losing his temper. Apparently customer service is not his forte., 0
The food was so-so and our service was slow. Also the music was so loud that I couldn't hear half of what my wife was saying. Now that's not a bad thing but when it was my turn to speak it was annoying. We won't be going back. There are many better  places to dine., 0
Do not give any support to these scam artists. Check with the Better business bureau or CNN coverage.  The family that operates this refuses to do any interviews or answer questions clearly ( what legitimate charity would do that?), 0
What is with all of the great ratings?! The woman who served us was rude. I ordered salade nicoise and my mom the crepe. Out came two salads and when my mom said she ordered the crepe she was rudely told "no, 0

I don't typically review fast food chains but this location just asked for it. I wish I could give one star for this sorry excuse for a fried chicken chain. Not only do they have the WORST customer service ever (well, 0
My boyfriend and I celebrated our two year anniversary this weekend and I decided (although last minute) to book a massage for the both of us. I called the spa and left a message to see if they had appointments. Nobody called me back. I called again and finally spoke to someone. I let the guy know that I was holding off on purchasing a couple Groupons until I confirmed they had available appointments. He booked our appointments for 12pm and let me know that check in time was at 11:30am. We arrived at about 11:45am and were told that we needed to have our tickets printed (guy never told me this!).....after haggling with the front desk lady for a few minutes they let me know that I could email the tickets to them...well there is no reception there so I couldn't.....then they told me that because I was 30 minutes late that time would be shaved off our massage...which was ridiculous because check in time is different than my actual appointment time! I thought it was really tacky to say that to someone especially when that was not communicated when I scheduled the appointment. They eventually rushed us in, 0

I've been to this place twice to say I gave it a chance.......big mistake!  The items that are being sold is stuff I literately would not even give to a homeless person in need.  The shoes are the MOST DISGUSTING thing ever!!!!!! Seriously who would want to pay $30 to $80 for a pair of raggedy, 0

I'm not sure where to begin on this one. My husband and I had a date night which doesn't happen very often with one year old twins and a 3 yr old at home. We decided to try out AG for the 1st time since we wanted a good steak. Waited 4-5 minutes to be seated and ordered a couple of Blue moon beers on draft. When I was halfway done with my beer, 0
RUDE RUDE RUDE everytime I call to order and the people that answer the phone they are rude.  I rec'd a coupon saying we missed you from the owner tried to use it and called and got Kayla forget it not worth the run around or the attitude. I will go somewhere where they actually want the business.  I ask for Pam the owner to call me a month ago and the night manager refused to even give her the messenger.  Will be the last time I attempt to give them any business., 0
This was by far the WORST strip club that I have ever been to! The place is huge to begin with so you have a tough time seeing the stage shows if you are seated in one of the tables along the back wall. It was completely packed as well. The dancers didn't have much personality and were over the top fake.   First off, 0
Worst service experience ever!  Been there 4 times and every time there were issues.  One time for a simple oil change and they didn't tighten the oil plug and oil leaked all over.  Took it back to have them look at it, 0

The first time I tried BBQ King was roughly 4 years ago and I was very surprised they had the most authentic HK style wonton noodle soup in the United States. I would stop by their place every time I was in Vegas just for their wonton noodle soup. I was in Vegas on the Xmas weekend and as usual I went there for lunch. I ordered wonton noodle soup, 0

This was my first visit to the restaurant. My friends took me there for a very casual impromptu birthday lunch. The food was good but the service was horrible. The gentleman waiting on us was extremely rude.  I did not want my friends to feel bad for bringing me there for my birthday so I tolerated it. Any other day I would not accept such poor customer service and would have left promptly.  It's  unfortunate because I really enjoyed the food; however, 0

Can I give this place no stars for no service!!  Pull into drive through and it's extremely slow as usual.  The guy comes on the speaker and says "I'll be right with you".  Nearly 5 minutes later a truck pulls into the other lane and is immediately helped.  REALLY!!  Do they think I'm sitting here for my health?  I leave and go to McDonalds, 0

We had an hour to kill before this year's Beer Fest at The Lakes accross the street. There was 5 of us so we ended up here one dead Sunday afternoon. What better to do before a beer fest but drink beer and wait entirely too long for some lunch. The place was dead not a soul in site and dark as hell inside. We ask to sit outside no big deal we thought, 0

In 'n Out is so much better and cheaper! The burger is tasteless (even with a ton of add-ons like guacamole and hot sauces or bbq sauces that they offer). The bun deflates after a few pinches. The caesar salad was DRENCHED in dressing...practically a soup of dressing., 0
Boo!! Definitely on a different caliber then other Vegas clubs I've been to. And not in a good way. It's at the new Hotel Aria, 0

This place is always understaffed.  You can wait in line to check out for 20 min. or more.  Also their check-out process seems less than efficient., 0
This is somewhere you go once.  It's awesome that they've turned a church into a brewery. Throwing the kettles onto the altar: perfect. The beer itself is pretty decent; I'm a fan of the Pious Monk Dunkel especially.  The food is good, 0

Don't bother stopping here. Stopped in at 10am on a Tuesday and was turned away. They told me their "system was down" and it would be a half hour before they could do any oil changes. So I drove 1/2 mile east and went to Steel Image Oil and Lube and not only did they change the oil but they did a free car wash in less than 15 minutes!, 0
This place is a joke.  The carrot cake was repulsive and made me want to throw up in my mouth.  The chocolate souffle wasn't much better.    I recommend some cooking classes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 0

Owner is rude and manager Amanda does not return calls.  They owe me $500 for an item I did not pick and they are refusing to issue credit to my credit card or another order I already paid for.  Prices are also absurd and they act like you are a bad person if you ask for a discount when buying thousands of dollars worth of clothes!  Go to Nordstrom Rack, 0
This store does not compare to the other vintages shops on 7th Avenue. I just hate when a "vintage" shop incorporates so many new items into their inventory and still consider themselves a vintage shop. Plus, 0

I've been in twice so far. The food on the first visit was horrible. They have to hand pick out chips that are not spicy (gross) and the food was awful. The second time I was in was just for a drink and the waitress got pissy with me for moving her serving tray off of the bar seat I wanted to sit on.  I will never come in here again, 0
Normally love cousins subs. Went there just for a chicken noodle soup. I was waiting 20 minutes, 0

How can you have a cart and be the most delicious thing ever- but have a restaurant that is not as impressive?  We went in April with a group of friends. There was nothing light on the menu. I was eating potatoes and carrots. It was heavy. Nothing felt "spring". It felt like a winter menu.  Local food does not have to be bland. This was bland. Safe.  I was expecting delicious flavors to be exploding in my mouth (like Harvest Moon Cart)- but that did not happen.  Also, 0
A week ago I called and made an appointment to get my hair cut and styled.  I have medium length straight hair that's not too thick or thin.  Apparently I was booked with a "Master Stylist" - although this was not told to me on the phone when I made the appointment.  In the chair I was told the stylist was a "master stylist" and that my haircut would be $10 extra because of that.  I went ahead thinking I'd get a better haircut.  When I got home, 0

Finally a Paradise Bakery near me! I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for them anymore! No longer will my family be forced to make an adventure across the other side of town to pick up my cookie cake because I hate real cake!   Right?  Wrong. This Paradise Bakery just plain sucks. I still order my cookie cakes and cookies from here because it's convenient but I would never eat their food. I've tried eating here twice. Once an albacore sandwich that tasted like someone died inside of it (not the fish). The second time was just pasta salad. How do you mess up pasta salad? TELL ME. Another time my cousin ordered tomato soup and she found what we presumed to be part of a plastic spoon inside of it. How does that even happen? Are they intentionally messing with us or did they really just serve us used soup?  This location is always packed. I've never come here and not had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. That and the employees (besides ONE old lady who works there) are total jerks. I'm serious. Dude you work at Paradise Bakery for a living. Don't talk down to me when I'm trying to order a cookie.   I only come here to get my Mr Pibb fix or to buy my mom cookies. Their cookies are just as good as any other Paradise. I have no idea what happened to their food or who trained their employees., 0
Had my very first experience with eyelash extensions here in December 2013.  Had a pleasant experience with them being placed, 0
The waitress was prompt with  getting our order and really nice.  However the food took 45 minutes and people that got seated after us were done eating before our food arrived.  The  manager Ericka apologized and gave us 4 dollars off our order. After telling her that is more of an insult than paying full price for waiting a half hour she managed to give us 8 dollars off.  So two starving people waiting about a  half hour extra saved a grand total of 8 dollars.  Pretty much minimum wage. Never eating there again!, 0

I have been a Carlos'Briens fan for many years and having not been there for a while my better half and I decided to grab a quick bite at the bar last night. I really have nothing good to say about any part of our visit. Having been in the restaurant business myself I can be pretty forgiving when it is obvious that the place is understaffed and I am willing to be patient as long as it is acknowledged that I am sitting there waiting...instead we literally waited (at the bar) for 15 minutes without either one of the bartenders making so much as eye contact. I finally had to wave my arms before somebody said Hi. I was not the only one having this problem as both people to either side on me had been waiting longer than we had and a couple of the tables gave up and left. We finally placed our order of queso dip and a chimichanga with a bartender that was less than thrilled. The queso was really bad and chimi was mediocore at best. Nobody ever asked if there was an issue with the queso as the bowl was literally untouched. On the upside the chips and salsa are still good. We paid our tab and bailed. I made a quick stop to the restroom only to find it out of soap with the trashcan overflowing and paper towels all over the floor. All and all a very disappointing trip. Carlos O'Briens needs to make a serious effort to get their restaurant back to what it used to be., 0
The portions here are quite small (and I am a small person, 0

Sat with my wife for 30 minutes without drinks. Menu looks good and while expensive, 0
- They played classic piano music by Daniel Barenboim which made the Asian experience incomplete!   - Dumplings were flash pan-fried with old oil..one can smell it. - Sushi rice was not nicely prepared. - Service was not friendly + any order that was ready was brought to the table regardless if we finished starters/soup or not.   I dont know about sushi standards in Edinburgh because every time I walk down the street I see the place packed?! Maybe I ordered the wrong stuff. The only good thing was the wassabi coated nuts and the miso soup., 0
We live in Vegas and go to the Broiler once or twice a year. We went tonight and apparently they changed the menu since we were there last. Everything is ala carte. You have to buy a side dish separately. And the prices for the entrees are ridiculous. They are charging strip prices. We will never go back. The quality of the fish seemed worse than Red Lobster. Think twice before going here., 0
My husband went for lunch on Saturday and were disappointed.  It must have changed hands the decor had changed a bit and the bread was different (not in a good way).  The bread was very soggy like it had been sitting for hours and it was only lunch time.  The service was horrible even though there were only people sat three tables.  It was just not as welcoming and friendly as it used to be.  Though I hand't been there in few months it "was" one of my go to restaurants., 0
I checked this place out mainly because of the name. It implies that either cigars are made on the premises, 0
Waited 2 and a half hours although they told me the driver went out with my food twice. I did a delivery order and the confirmation email said 40-60 minutes. After contacting eat 24 for the second time they finally tracked down my order. The restaurant refused to refund my money, 0
Your Prestige Chrysler Jeep Dodge location in Centennial Hills is the worst service department I've ever dealt with in 30 years!  They serviced my car ($990) and the check engine light came on a day later.  Charged me another $950 to "fix" my transmission.  Gave me the car back with the check engine light still on!!!  Thirty miles later, 0
We had such high hopes for the Aria.  It started off badly with a nearly 30 minute wait for the check in. I suppose it's not completely the fault of the Aria, 0

Terrible service. Mediocre food. We literally spent 2.5 hours here just trying to have lunch. It became a case of weighing how much time we had already invested vs. 'should we just get up and leave.' We should have left. By the time we were done, 0
We went here for dinner the other night and ended up wishing we hadn't.  The staff is very friendly and that's probably what keeps this place open. The food is bland at best and way overpriced for a little hole in the wall. I ordered a strawberry margarita and found that a strawberry had never been near it. Clearly a flavored mix. We each had a shrimp taco and a fish taco. The shrimp had been so overcooked that it was like chewing on little lumps of plastic. The fish had no flavor at all as it hadn't been seasoned. We left with a feeling of "Lesson learned.", 0
FAIL!! This Filibertos openend recently in place of Church's chicken.

Not a very good experience at all. Once seated we had to wait over 15 minutes for our server to show up. We asked for samples of a couple of beers and placed our order at the same time.

I had heard of this place via the Travel channel.  This is for the Tropicana Ave location.  As I looked them up over the net i saw that they delivered.  So since i was on the strip I thought I would call and check to see how far they delivered.  I don't know who answered the line when I called but I asked what was the delivery range? He replied in such broken english that it could not be understood.  I asked again. He replied in the same way with some other words that could not be understood.  At that point I said never mind and hung up.  I then just got in the car with my friends and decided to drive over.  Mind you, 0

After reading some of the mixed reviews we decided to check out Distill for ourselves. Things started out great but quickly went downhill.

I have only been here once so this review is simply based on a one lunch stand.  I ordered the Vegetable sandwich and they did not have the roasted red peppers or the grilled eggplant so these two things were automatically substituted with mushrooms and tomatoes?  The guy making my sandwich could not speak english so their was no "hey man is it cool if we don't have the red pepper and eggplant" conversation.   The hummus was pretty good on the sandwich but the bread salad side didn't taste like anything.  That is your only option also is either a bag of chips or bland bread salad.    Thirdly a sandwich and a drink was like $13 bucks.  I don't mind spending money on good food but this seemed kinda steep for a lackluster lunch.  With Daily Dose right next door I am not sure what would be making me go back to this place., 0
Very expensive for a bowl of soup just over $7.00. Also the very small potato chips for the Kettle bag is $1.99. Really!!! That is way to high for 4oz of chips and mostly air., 0
I would honestly give 2 1/2 stars if possible and here is why. 1.Parking is crazy. Once you park you have to back out of the lane because there is only one way to go. 2. List 3 haunted houses but honestly 2 1/2 and that is stretching it. The Maze part (Chaos)  at the end is not worth the wait- and you have to wait in line even if you have a fast pass which we had.  The props in the first and best attraction was   "The crypt" and worth a visit. I would have them expand that haunted house and ditch the other two. If you want to try it go with the Fast pass., 0
The service was quite bad here. Our waiter did his best to facilitate what had to be the WORST kitchen turn around I have ever seen. The order took 30 minutes to serve, 0
My wife and I went out for dinner the Friday night 1-3-15 it was our second time toe Luke's both time the service was poor but on this night it ruined what was a great meal. Once we had been seated a server came took our drink orders for the woman who would be serving us another waiter brought us the drinks. our server came twice to get and app order and out dinner order then we did not see her until I was half way through the meal. She never offered to refill my water nor offer another glass of wine until my glass sat empty for half of my meal. It took ten minutes for her to cash out of check with the gift card we used and when she dropped of the check it came with no thank you or smile. My wife and I are sorry that we caused this server such heart ache by having to serve us food and drink. The food is good but this will keep us from coming back., 0
This is the worst location that I've been to in LV/Henderson. I just left with a smoothie that was full of chunks of ice. I used the restrooms when I was there and they were dirty. Graffiti etched into the mirror and no one could handle putting the huge toilet paper in the dispenser so it was just sitting on top. Crappy experience, 0
I went in to pick up a dvd set I ordered online. The cashier at the pick-up section was very rude. I asked for a store receipt and she rolled her eyes and told me that she was going to hand me a copy of my receipt. I understand the amount of teenagers who work at the store but I expected more well-mannered people. I also did not like getting followed by a staff member who probably thought I was going to steal. This is why I shop at Amazon, 0

Worse customer service!  I cannot review the food as only the Tom Yum came out. The server did not bother to service our table. The very rude oversized server lacks any personality and is clearly in the wrong profession. It is unfortunate that the manger tries to make excuses for his employee less than stellar service skills. Stay away unless you want to be treated like your money and patronage are not welcomed., 0
What a complete waste of time, 0
Sat at the pool for an hour without a server coming by. Had to go to the bar and order food and drinks. Oscar...the Spa Manager...was not helpful at all with a problem we had at the spa. Terrible customer service., 0
Sad ... I had a Gyro platter.. Great service.. They gave a lot of everything. But with so much competition in the Greek faster food world the meat tasted like bland processed meat.    I would compare this to a chain in CA called daphne ..    If you like that taste than GREAT . This is the place for you..., 0
I was a big fan of BT's Burger Joint after they opened.  My last experience will make it very difficult to return.   The manager had part of the dining area closed for floor cleaning. Employee's were taking money, 0

I placed an order through GrubHub and had a couple of modifications on two of the sandwiches (i.e. no mayonnaise and no tomato).  When I received the order the two sandwiches were not modified like I ordered.  When I called to let the restaurant know I was expecting an apology but instead she was very hostile.  She said that she was very busy and that it is difficult to make modifications when they are busy.  I am sure that most restaurants are busy during lunch time and I have never had any issues with other restaurants making modifications.  I have never written a review, 0
I've had their breakfast burrito and didn't think it wasall that great.  It was like too much of nothing special.  If you're looking for just a big-o breakfast burrito to fill you up though, 0

Fun place to dance but the business end of it is horrible. I went on my 21st birthday and was told I need my new id before I come in next time. That's all. I come in with the new temp id that the MVD gave me and say I can't come in without two more forms of id. Wish I would've known that the first time rather than driving all the way back home to get that. The bouncer was also super smart and trying to be funny but in all reality he was just holding up the line and pissing people off. Oh, 0

I've always come to yelp to read helpful no-hold-barred reviews but this is the first time I've been moved to write one of my own because no one should waste their time and money at this "fine dining" restaurant.  Before we sat at our table we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a very affable bartender - it looked like we were in for a great night...until we got seated with a server who was part used car salesman part annoying high school substitute teacher.  This guy proceeded to go through and lecture us on the menu for literally 10 minutes...we can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expensive steak you offer.  This server (I use this term very loosely because we didn't get his name) proceeded to tell us that we shouldn't consider the filet or the fish dishes (really, 0
We picked this hotel because it was within walking distance of Chase Field. We have tickets for a diamonbacks game and my husband and I thought we would make a weekend out of. Where do I start.... The staff is super friendly.  When we 1st got here I was highly impressed.  Our view beautiful. . But then we noticed we could hear EVERYTHING.  The people going in and out. The club within the hotel until at least 1am. All I wanted was quite and be able to sleep in since that is unheard of in my house and it didnt happen. As much as we paid for the hotel with no free WiFi and the noise factor.  I will NOT be coming back., 0
Two words:  SMELLY and DIRTY!  Do not, 0
I didn't have any choice since it was my sister's birthday.. I would have rather have cooked at home than to have experienced the "OG". However it wasn't as bad as I remember.. though the pasta was over cooked and the sauces lack depth overall the experience wasn't that dreadful. However I was also so happy to see my 2 nephews getting so big and enjoying themselves gorging on hot greasy bread sticks.. it was a family affair., 0
Have waited in the drive through for over 15 minutes multiple times.  Would recommend going to one of the many other taco bells that are close, 0
The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, 0
This review is based solely on hotel stay.  Dear Wynn, 0
Everyone there gets enjoyment out of belittling you....  Nothing frustrates me more than 20 year olds with stupid haircuts and neck tattoos attempting to make me feel like you know nothing about your craft... I have been playing guitar and dealing with equipment longer than most of the associates have been alive....  I went in there for a Line 6 Shortboard, 0
i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews Joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise).   ambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted.  the wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority.   the food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the filet mignon i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), 0
Terrible service; mediocre food. We will not visit here again!, 0
So I was in Vegas over Thanksgiving week and we were going to go to the Bellagio buffet on Thanksgiving day. There was a 3 hr wait. We decided to go to the MGM buffet being that we were going to the David Copperfield show at the MGM that night. There was no wait....... For a reason. It was well below average. I thought it was a level above Sizzler. I don't expect much from Sizzler but I do expect more out of a huge hotel like MGM. Food was dry, 0
Bad service. Waiter was rude and obnoxious.  We never got refills on drinks or salsa. The menus were sticky. Fajitas came out w literally one tablespoon of cheese..we live in Wisconsin! !! The chimichangas were on point though., 0
It was my 3rd time coming to this salon. The staff is very nice and speak English. The salon itself is very clean, 0
It's fine. The dining area is too dark and the lunch buffet is mediocre. I have a feeling dinner is a better bet than lunch, 0
Will not come back. Food is average but the service is terrible.   The Pho is not impressive but OK and their egg rolls are made from refrigerated product with some unrecognizable stuff inside!!  The service is among the worst I've ever experienced. The waitress/owner gave a face like a stone and didn't even say a word when taking our order. The only one word we got there was a "Thanks" when she bring the check.... Since we were the only Asian customers there and all others were getting normal service, 0
PLEASE READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING HERE. Like a good diligent amd responsible person, 0
Food is pretty decent BUT waiting for 45min to get it was less than thrilling. Coffee is fantastic. They need to streamline their service a little better so I'll come back in 6 months to see if they've made some changes., 0
I ordered the orange shrimp, 0
20 years dinning at sushi restaurants and this place makes the list as the most destructive.  I cater sushi, 0
I've lived at Mark Taylor properties for about five or six years now and I have to say, 0
Food was ok. Guacamole tasted ok but a menu partner was Cavalo. This company makes guacamole for a living. Is their guacamole really fresh?    They sent a mixed message with music, 0
Ive had good experience from this place once. I came back with a friend and was very disappointed. There was hair on one of the side dishes. Service was horrible and the place wasn't even packed., 0
We hadn't been here in a while so we decided to try it again.  It was a disappointment..the frozen yogurt always seems grainy--not creamy like I've had at other frozen yogurt shops., 0
Lunchtime was weird. Their credit card machine was down and they had to go old school with that. There was one poor dude whos credit card was declined 3 times and the manager said that it was not their system. Until my work credit card was declined.  Anyway, 0
I really do love your food. I had heard that you guys deliver so I googled it and to my excitement yes there was a tweet that said you do indeed deliver.  I went to your website to place my order but couldn't find the delivery option. i tried to create an account but that was a headache because it said I already had one, 0
Weird! For some reason a yelp review was removed in regards to Body English. Well, 0
I shop here all the time..VERY pissed off when I cannot return something even for store credit after SEVEN days...REALLY?! What a waste. The cashier (Liezle Radaza) had told me that the maxi skirt I got was the same as ones I've previously purchased. When it came time to wear the skirt I realized it was straight cut & did NOT fit the same at all. I brought it in to exchange for something new, 0
Seriously disappointed. Saw it at 8pm on 3/13.   If you've seen the movie, 0
We had tortilla soup, 0
This used to be one of my favorite mexican restaurants in Vegas. And I'm not coming back for a long time.  My last experience was baaad. Not only the food was less than good, 0
Las Vegas friends: I don't usually make a fuss and blast a place but sadly my favorite Mexican food Don Tortaco has disappointed me. They failed to put all the food I bought into my bag. I discovered it at home of course. I drive back after a phone call for a refund request produced no results. They apologized, 0
Decent hotel. Nice people. Rooms are good. Restaurant food & service is good. But the wifi is impossibly slow in the bedrooms. Hilton has a wifi upgrade that you pay are supposed to pay for. The keep the so-called complementary wifi annoyingly slow. As a business traveler these days you need wifi and I will not stay at hotels that make you pay for wifi., 0
First time here.  Kinda dead for a Saturday night. Came for TVs to watch football. Called before we came to see if there was happy hour...'yes, 0
I love thrift stores but I'll take my chances elsewhere from this Goodwill location. It is very stereotypical of what you would think a thrift store is:  filthy, 0
Underwhelmed  I have heard many positive things about this restaurant over the years, 0
So here's the story on Rare. I was on the phone in the parking lot finishing with a call for about five minutes before going in the restaurant. So we walked in and were immediately escorted to our table. The server greeted us a few minutes later. Normal, 0
Horrible!!! Waited over an hour just to check in.The forgot my wake-up call, 0
Horrible service!! I had been to this restaurant once before and the food was good so decided to come back for a date night with my boyfriend. When we arrived the place was pretty empty but it seemed like they were preparing for an event. The host found a table for us, 0
IP is pretty much one of the worst places you can stay on the strip which is unfortunate because its right in the center of the strip.   They buffet is pretty gross and will most likely make you sick.   The rooms are definitely get what you pay for, 0
Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner last night because I had a Chinese food craving and thought it would be good to try something new. Honestly, 0
Third time is not the charm. Sorry guys but your waitress was rude and sarcastic (and not in a good way either.) I'd love to come into this restaurant and have a friendly vibe but it just isn't happening. Water is not filtered and you can taste it. Hot chocolate was neither sweet nor chocolately. And hey, 0
The music, 0
I've lived near this store for about a year now and I've used it mostly for connivence based on its location. The prices seem relatively higher than other grocery stores in the area and most of the employees are disengaged and rude. There are no longer self-checkout lanes, 0
We did a carryout here last night and it was awful. I have no idea what everyone is raving about. Obviously they've never had good  pizza. We got the cheese, 0
I've been craving Indian food since I moved from Boston to Phoenix two months ago, 0
They refused service due to my pregnancy?!!  I must say I'm really quite sad to write this review as this was once one of my favorite spots on the strip, 0
Awful service. One waitress was more interested in socializing rather the making the bar more money or tips.   Came in with a group of 5 people. Ready to spend. Difficult to get the waitress attention and when we finally verbalized our order, 0
I was incredibly disappointed with the service that I received in the afternoon Sunday, 0
I REALLY wanted to enjoy my experience here. I heard so many great things about this hotel and was looking forward to my bachelorette weekend (not MY wedding, 0
I would give this place a 2.5 if I could. To be honest, 0
What's with the cheese?  It isn't even Velveta.  It's liquid cheese food and it belongs somewhere other than on my burger.  $5 burger and fries is a great deal IF -- IF -- it's a great deal.  This is just liquid cheese food on a hamburger patty.  McDonald's will do a burger and fries for $5 that's tastier than this dump., 0
I am a big fan of Chicago style pizza but not Papa Del's. The crust is awfully thick and chewy and the fillings are not great. There's really nothing special about it. Papa Johns is wayyy better. Sorry . . . thumbs down., 0
My gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a Sat. This place sucks! The bartender was unfriendly and the bloody mary had no alcohol. Wont return again. It also smells like cigarette smoke from before they banned smoking in the bars. Gross! better dive bars to be had, 0
ahhh!! I wish I can give negative stars!!  My friends and I had thee worse experience at this place a few months ago.  We happened to have late dinner here since we were at the casino already and my friend had the Vegas club discount.    I forgot what we had ordered, 0
First time I visited was so amazing, 0
This Ruby Tuesday Was Really Gross The Bathrooms  Were nasty Smelled Like crap. I lost my appetite and ended up leaving with a turned my stomach. The staff was horrible we asked for a manager and they didn't even come to our table and see what went wrong.  Me and my husband didn't even want the salad bar it was so gross. We left right as the food came out and even that was cold. All across the bored I would never go back to that location again., 0
This is an Asian mall that has quite a few Asian stores and restaurants in it along with a few other businesses as well.  The place is always packed, 0
2nd review for what used to be one of our favorites... used to be. Came here today- We finished our basket of chips before the drinks came out. There were three tables in the restaurant so not sure what took so long, 0
Next door favorite Tachido was closed for lunch, 0
1.Gave away our rooms cause "we came too late" (like what the heck?! It was before 8!) We paid for the rooms, 0
The food is great but I agree with the rest of these reviews, 0
I came here for dinner a few weeks ago after reading the reviews on yelp.  I was pretty disappointed and won't be going back.  I got a cup of the wonton soup as an appetizer - it was pretty pathetic.  The wontons had a dime-sized amount of meat in each one, 0
Read the reviews of this company and decided to give them a try.  Called this morning to arrange a cab for tomorrow.   I was greeted with the proverbial "we are assisting other clients" line followed by a "leave a message".  Left a message and 3 hours later, 0
I was not impressed. We went for an oil change because it was close by, 0
Stayed here once in 2006 and had roaches in the room.  Now in October of 2010 my husbands company had an incentive trip.  6 people so far have been hit with credit card fraud!  The highest victim got hit for a 1200.00 purchase on the same card used to check in.  Stay away or monitor your credit after staying here!!!!!!!, 0
The pictures looked tasty but when you eat it, 0
I ate breakfast here. The restaurant is located in Terrible's and lives up to the casinos name. This is may be the worst breakfast I ever had. The taste was awful. The place was dingy. The atmosphere was stale and smoky. (Yea I know it is in a casino) On the good side relatively cheap, 0
After making an appointment and arriving early like I was asked to do they tell me I have a two hour wait., 0
These are lying scam artists who will tell you anything to get you to part with your money. Once they've got that credit card set up to auto-bill though, 0
Hooters needs to fly in the hot ones from there other locations cause they are NOT here !!   One or two out of 20 deserve the hooters outfit .   But hey it's Vegas !!!   Have alot to drink and they will all look good.  Sorry girls but you would never get the job at any other location so enjoy Vegas.., 0
I just left this place ten minutes ago out of frustration. I was planning to buy chocolates, 0
Head-scratch for sure. I'm going to go out on a limb on this one and normally I don't bother writing a review for a place that already has a lot of opinions, 0
We have been customers at this location twice. The first time wasn't that bad. The server was cool and friendly. They still try to upsell you, 0
No charm. At least go to NY NY and have a beer at their sports bar.   Some of the worst future odds in town. I could not believe that the Wynn was substantially better (6-1 versus 10-1)   They just have basic future bets so I went to Wynn to get my Dancing with the Stars bet in. Go CB., 0
Eh.... Place is ok. Staff isn't very friendly. They barely used any cream cheese on my bagel. Bad customer service. Wouldn't go back!, 0
Not impressed. I went in for my first professional bra fitting last weekend. I was really excited to find a bra that fit since my current ones are old and all stretched out. She fitted me in the ribcage and I was "exactly" a 38. She didn't fit me across the bust, 0
I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited.   I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style. When asked if I needed any assistance, 0
I go to this CVS pretty often because of how close it is to where I live and because it's got overall pretty decent prices when it comes to beer and champagne and what have ya.  I'm not sure where their prices stand on their hard liquor but usually anything outside of a liquor store is pretty outrageous.  Also, 0
Bad service and rude employee. She made mistakes with our order and made us feel unwelcome. Like it was an inconvenience to fix the order and refund the overage. Anyone have a good falafel place for the north valley?, 0

If a mixture of boiled meats in one pot is your thing, 0
They now have driven off a customer who used to rave about them to shop at Trader Joe's instead. Rude associates, 0
The good: The ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful. Also, 0
Was told that my project would take 2 weeks. Reality was they took over 3 months. Every step of the way there were problems/delays/complete lack of coordination. One of their foreman lied to me and was caught red-handed in that lie. Too many problems to list - stay away from this business if you need anything more than water spill clean up. Do not let them do your restoration work!, 0
Went into this mostly empty bar on Christmas Eve to watch a game.  We sat down on some comfortable couches and prepared to watch the end of the 10am game.  We were quickly shooed away by an employee and told we should sit elsewhere, 0
40 minutes for an oil change and then a hard up sell at the end.  At least they vacuumed my carpets., 0
Disappointed.  Ordered burgers, 0
I can't even believe I saw these guys pop up when I looked for "lawyer" in AZ.  I am compelled to write a review because of my family's experience with this firm.  My experience with them is not direct, 0
Despite meeting Wilmer Valderrama, 0
I'm only giving this restaurant 1 star for the food being edible when hungry, 0
Extremely difficult to deal with on the phone. I asked if they took my insurance and the woman told me I would have to call my insurance company and get back to her. She couldn't be bothered to at least transfer me to the billing department to see if they take my insurance. No, 0
Came here for an early dinner at around 5 on a Monday.  Had the prime rib special...prime rib not flavorful at all, 0
My boyfriend and I were in the mood for something different than pub food so we thought Japanese might hit the spot. Well to be frank - it was a big disappointment. We arrived later than usual dinner time (around 8pm) and ordered just some tap water for drinks - the waitress said she would wipe the table for us first... Though she went and got the waters and then proceeded to wipe other empty tables before ours (just strange)?  At about 8.10pm we ordered the mixed plate of sashimi, 0
Its not a big deal, 0
Awful experience was in Arizona for my daughters basketball tournament and between games we were on a mad dash to find a dress. Greeted at the door and after that we were on our own. I guess they don't like to help girls in basketball clothes and obviously just played.in a game .Asked a sales associate if 3 dresses were on the 50 %off rack and she assured us they were. traveling for sports we have to have a budget in place. My daughter decided on a beautiful dress to find out the dress WASNOT on sale . The  associate that was ringing us out was the associate that.told us they were on sale . After walking without purchasing the dress.With  my daughter completely broken hearted to return into the store to talk to the other manager Lindsay let her know how I felt and the store basically used he bait and switch on us. Lindsay being a manger didn't do a thing but stand there telling me the customer service rep was out till Tuesday? Really if I were at Macys I would have received the price I was quoted. I purchased the dress only because my daughter had prom I less than a week away and my daughter paid the other half as if it were 50 off . have 3 girls and will NEVER step foot in another Davids Bridal ., 0
Garbage garbage garbage..... worst service in America I do not recommend for any one...., 0
Food good.  Soda/water warm (you gotta add ice)  Restaurant dirty (you gotta clean the place...if the bathroom is dirty, 0
I had hoped for much better.  The hotel has seen better days I'm sure.  The rooms and hallways were in disrepair (chipped walls, 0
I've been here twice on trips to Scottsdale and the food is pretty good, 0
C'mon. This is MGM... one of the best casino/hotels in Vegas. And they house this? MGM should be ashamed. Granted, 0
It only gets 2 stars for having beer pong at 11AM. But otherwise I would give it 1 star. Vegas is the city of hospitality, 0
New owners. Service is SLOW. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and carne asada torta. The quesadilla came out eventually, 0
I moved to Henderson a couple months ago so I've been trying out different places to get my nails done with no luck, 0
To start with the one star is given only because I couldn't give anything less. I have been to this place twice (second was only out of desperation). The food is not bad I agree, 0
Came to here to here to grab lunch and watch the Warriors play in the playoffs.  First off there's a minimum $25 a person just to sit, 0
First they don't carry any tall sizes.  Americans are getting taller - proven fact.  Please carry tall sizes.  I bought two Calvin Klein pillows today and when I got home and removed them from the zippered case, 0
Dirty ... Spend the extra money and book at a cleaner hotel. Even though they have housekeeping "clean" the rooms, 0
I have to say this place is very meh.  It is a tiny place, 0
I was so excited to see Zinc at the airport!  They had the omelette available and I love it at Zinc Bistro so that's what I ordered. Big mistake. After the first bite I realized it tasted seriously off.  Tried the crispy potato and it tasted old and just bad. Talked to the waitress. She came back, 0
This was our second visit to Baby Stacks, 0
Dumpy supermarket.  Try another one.  Also, 0
It's really hard to find a great sushi place that's consistent. I purchased a Groupon for this place since it was close by my house. I took a friend for lunch and we were told we don't get the special lunch prices if we use a Groupon. So in the end, 0
Gross gross made me and my daughter throw up! Go to the deli. If there closed denny's is across the street.  I hate denny's but it's still 100 times better., 0
Can't find the item I was looking for, 0
My husband loves this place. We've ate here before and we've ate at the one in Myrtle Beach. Personally, 0
Yikes! I've heard so many people talk up Tamari and geez! Are your taste buds gone? bad Chinese is better than this place. Maybe that was a wee bit harsh but COME ON! Not a fan at all.  Their ceviche was bland and had no flavour. The citrus should enhance the flavours of the dish but it didn't stand a chance. The Robata came with burnt salmon and shrimp plus their idea to do a ponzu butter was extremely odd and just weird. The only good dishes I had ended up being their Korean tenderloin and their Angry lobster roll. Sadly the food here is a little disappointing. Way to let me down. :(  Ill give Tamari this and only this their cocktails are delicious but that's not going help much when it comes to me returning. I've had better food at places that were considerably cheaper and better quality. No thank you Tamari. You are not for me., 0
While this place has great food, 0
Bad customer service. I went there to exchange something I had bought 1 hour before and if was such a hassle to get mh money back.  The guys are very expressive and did not find that professional., 0
Okay ive been to many sushi joints. With that being said, 0
I called to get general information. Unfortunately, 0
Don't eat here except for breakfast. The morning staff is awesome. Manager Tobyn is awesome. However went to eat dinner there last night and ordered the prime rib rare. It came well done and was told they could do nothing about it.  Ended up ordering a different steak but took 20 minutes (first one took 10). Steak was on. Called over manger, 0
Keep in mind I'm a Scottsdale brat here. Went here with a pretty large homeschool group with kids of all ages. Convenient ATM and Mexican restaurant connected to the place. I however did not try the food. It was a weekday afternoon with only one person working the entire place and it seemed pretty busy besides our group there were plenty of other bowlers. Since their was only one person setting up games, 0
You should kick yourself in the balls rather than give these assholes any of your money.  This is what happens when you allow government sanctioned monopolies.  Shitty service, 0
Had dinner buffet at Aria which is a gourmet buffet and includes unlimited wine. It also includes half a Maine Lobster per person for $38.95 each. So at those rates I expected a lot and I'm sorry to say I was highly disappointed. The server we had was not the best. The lobster was small and over cooked. It was so soft I could crack the shell with my bare hands. The highlight of my buffet experience at Aria were the cuts of meats. The skirt steak, 0
Mold covered beer bottle...my boyfriend is a local and takes me to S3 every time I visit. It was my friends 30th bday and we decided to take her there for brunch on Saturday. Service was lackluster and food came out cold...the worst moment when my boyfriend ordered a second beer...an expensive beer...and it was covered in MOLD! He immediately went to ask for manager and did not like what he saw in the kitchen...we received our food for free but unfortunately that experience ruined the mood...makes you wonder what else is moldy in that place...bummer., 0
Absolutely the most rude manager. I returned a floor power cleaner because when I opened the box the nozzle was full of hair & dirty. The manager said well this has been used. If she would have looked at it she would have realized it came that way. She was very rude to me and finally returned my money. I will NEVER shop there again !, 0
Hate to do this, 0
I was expecting a lot after reading the reviews here, 0
Terrible! They deserve 0 stars honestly! I have been here twice, 0
Really ALFUL! Do not go here! Had an appointment and has to wait 40 mins. Got a fill with gel color and the guy only did one coat of gel and color was spotty and got acrylic all over my cuticles. Nails were filed uneven. Wanted to cry and had to pay 35., 0
These people are pre judgmental assholes!If you are Black, 0
It's not often that I write a negative review. I usually try to find the positives and give a place at least an A-OK. I can't really do that for this Sammy's, 0

You suck Holsteins! You have kids meal sizes and food is not really worth the price. I can go to McDonald's and get better milkshakes. I shall not be back., 0
This place is ridiculously overpriced!  Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. $10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time., 0
This the second time we ate here, 0
Very disappointed You pay for chips & salsa, 0
Ehhh. Very average place. They have a great beer selection and a nice atmosphere.   We ordered the mozzarella cogs which were essentially just fried mozzarella with very little of the other flavors listed on the menu, 0
The designer of this particular Starbucks was not very bright.   Apparently they never anticipated lines at 6 am in the Las Vegas airport. Sheesh. Getting in and out is awful. In addition, 0

The hotel rooms are actually decent and it was nice having a kitchen.  Plus the beds were fairly comfy.  However, 0
Met a friend here for breakfast so I can't tell you anything about the rooms. What I did experience was a friendly check-in clerk and a large roomy parking lot that is right around the corner from the airport.  For the breakfast, 0
My family has used Bike Masters for the last two years for everything we needed and have always had good results till today. I brought my bike in to get repaired, 0
I really like Big Wong.   This is just to help them improve.  Their service sucks.  Everything is about $5 dollars.  The lady who has helped us both times is always alone. I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now.   Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.  Anyways they give you super small water cups.  So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 0
Disappointing to say the least. As a vegetarian, 0
SLOW service. Worst service ever! Thank goodness the food was good! It took 40 minutes for our food to come out!!! Our waitress only checked on us 1 time the whole time we were there and when she came to deliver our bill (with out asking if we wanted anything else) we told her that we had a Groupon and she gave us the worst attitude about it and said we should have told the hostess! REALLY??? the hostess???? Since when do you discuss your payment with the hostess?! Asked if there was a manager on duty and they told us no.  Probably will not go back there again., 0
WAY overpriced for food that is mediocre. Crappy service when I went, 0
We ordered a take out of ribs and salmon and were very disappointing with both. On a scale of 1-10 we gave them both a "2".  The fish was over-cooked and the ribs were tough while lacking flavor and tasted like they had been re-heated several times. Probably the worst ribs I have ever had.  Called the next day to report to the manager and they insisted that we bring the food back in for a coupon?  I obliged and after having the manger scrounge through our eaten food while questioning why there was not more uneaten food  I decided to take a pass on the coupon. Go across the street to Outback for better food and service.   Not recommended., 0

Once I was passing and went in for a quick slice of pizza and a delicious strawberry milkshake. I thought it was really nice so I went again last week and waited on a margarita pizza to take away. When I came home I was all excited to have it as I was starving till I opened my pizza to see the extra tomato on top wasn't even cooked and the pizza was all oily. I won't be getting a pizza again but I'll definitely be getting their milkshakes., 0
Quoted us 20 mins ETA for our food. Didn't get it till almost 1 hour later. Weak portion, 0
I'm very disappointed for the first time with Switch.  The lettuce wraps were loaded with cabbage and very little chicken.  The feta cheese, 0

This place is terrible. I took my parents and two boys to eat here. I was so upset that I spent a lot of money and none of is left satisfied. The restaurant itself was dirty. My two year old son wouldn't even eat the pizza or cookies so that told me something. What was suppose to be a nice family dinner turned out to be a disaster. Do yourself a favor and don't go eat here. I see why they have a sign up front saying no refunds!, 0

I was expecting more since there are so many 5 star reviews on yelp. Three friends and I tried Rokerij for the first time on Saturday. We had a reservation for 6:30. The specials are on a blackboard above your head behind you if you are seated in the booths. You have the practically get out to read them. The paper menus have a lot of abbreviations so you have to keep remembering what the letters mean. I don't want to work that hard. Can't you just spell out the words? I ordered the surf and turf from the Richardson's side of the menu. What was delivered was an unappetizing mess. The plate and everything on it was covered in a chili sauce. It looked like dog food with a piece of steak in the middle. Really it was a terrible presentation. My husband's plate looked the same. The other two at our table ordered from the Rokerij side and at least it looked a lot better. The two bacon wrapped shrimp were flavorful and my steak was over cooked for medium but OK. I could have skipped the messy beans or at least they could put them in a cup. I may try them again but just for happy hour and I'll keep the Rokerij side of the menu., 0
Very disappointed with this place.  Been there once  for lunch without any issues.  Raved about it to  my co-workers.  Made plans to have our company dinner there for X-Mas.  Service to put it mildly, 0
I've definitely experienced better service from other optometrists.  Dr. Mar and her assistants are friendly and I don't doubt her abilities (she graduated from Cal) but my issue was the customer service.  I went in the morning when they were already supposed to be open to pick up my glasses.  They were late.  After 15 minutes, 0
We went there to watch the AFC championship. Our waiter was rude and condensing . Food was bad. I won't go there again., 0
We stopped in for a quick bite to eat before our show.   Very impressed with how fast they were able to seat us, 0
I love Asian food. I love bad Asian food. I love MSG dumped crap that will probably give me cancer when I'm older. But this place.... It's actually bad-bad Asian food. The place itself has a nice environment and the prices are average compared to other restaurants similarly decorated to Red Bowl, 0
Customer service is a big issue here. Once you walk in you wait for a long time. One customer was getting irritated with them because he kept waiting and not getting his to go order. Some of the customers were just ignored and walked out because they couldn't wait anymore. Quality of their food is decent but the customer service needs to be fixed. When you see multiple people leaving their tables it will hurt your business. I think the biggest problem at this place is leadership and lack of leadership skills. Also waitress should never tell other customers "oh that guy is mad at me, 0
Disappointing portion sizes and bland food., 0
TOTALLY LAME! THEY SAY ONE PRICE ON THE WEB SITE THEN CHARGE YOU MORE IF YOU ARE STAYING SOMEWHERE NICE! WE  WERE STAYING AT ONE OF THE CLOSEST PLACES AND THEY STILL CHARGD US MORE THAN PPL ALL THE WAY DOWN THE STRIP.  THEN THEY TOLD US TO CALL ONE HOUR BEFORE AND WE DID. SORRRRYYY!  CAN'T HELP US!  and they did not care. So make your reservation 24 hours and not get stranded like us., 0
That place it's bad and overpriced  Don't waste you money and time!, 0
Thought this was just so-so. Maybe I should have stuck to just sushi rolls, 0
Horrible......bought some type of a groupon. Beware!!  They need groupon or LivingSocial to bring people in. Furniture is out dated and crittity.  I'm 140 lbs and I thought the furniture would give way.  Wanted a towel, 0

I just called them and was put on hold for 10 minutes. Then, 0

This place is decent but their are far better PHO and spring rolls in the valley. Like Dong A or Da Vang. Will never come again the spring rolls rice paper is too thick and gummy like kinda weird compared to other places and that kills it for me., 0

I went to the Street Eats Festival this past weekend with bestie and study buddy.  Luckily we arrived late and didn't have to pay an entrance or parking fee.  The lines were unnecessarily long and didn't move efficiently.  So happy I didn't purchase the 2 for $10 deal I saw on the Phoenix New Times Daily Deals prior to the event.  My friends got ice cream from Sweet Republic that they enjoyed.  The highlight of the day was the french fries from Superstition Farm! OMG!  They were delicious, 0
Dyson paid to have my item fixed this place was the closet authorized  fixer. Poor customer service i called them a week after i dropped off the vacuum just for the guy to say that they had to order a part and it would be at least 10 more days. Honestly it is free I do not really care how long it takes but call the customer and let them know what is going on do not just call them 3 weeks later and say ok your item is ready for pick up. Rating is for overall POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE., 0
I rated this a two on basically the bad service. The food is not worth the price but the portions are a good amount. I got the spicy chicken which was really spicy. I would share with someone  I tried my friends "Cold Soup" they bring it out with ice in it. Very interesting never had soup that was brought out cold. It had no flavor to it and eating ice cold soup is just too weird for me. Nasty, 0
The 1 star is for the breadsticks. The food is frozen, 0
Went here for the first time in my never ending quest for good Chinese food in the CLT.  For fast food Chinese, 0
Not good. Red curry had lots of spice and no flavor. Chow mein was a thin ramen looking noodle. Tons of MSG! Made us sick. Very overpriced! Cloth table cloths were covered in glass, 0
This location is horrible.  The order taking is inconsistent - Gina can never get things correct.  The product quality is inconsistent, 0
This is a hipster "stand around and look cool" type of bar, 0
Our food was pretty good but then again it's just your standard bar food, 0
I was so ready to enjoy Dominick's... my husband and I save eating at expensive restaurants for rare occasions in our life. Enjoying the anticipation and the reward we're about to give ourselves is as much a part of the experience as the actual eating itself so it's something we treat ourselves to sparingly so it doesn't become mundane.  We had reached one of these time-to-celebrate occasions for something or other and it happened to coincide with an overwhelming desire for a good steak. Dominick's is just across the street from us and we'd not been there yet so we decided it was the perfect opportunity for our evening out!   Unfortunately, 0
Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a food snob, 0
If I could submit a negative star review, 0
Customer service is horrible. It seems that if you need something you better go find it yourself because the employees here are very busy (supposedly) all the time.  There are always super long lines. I mean the only benefit from this whole experience here is that they have really cheap gas prices. Plus you can alwasy find movies and tamales in the parking lot.  but hey really if you are really looking to save money food here is really cheap. :), 0
We had a recommendation from a friend to go there when in Las Vegas. We love beer and the list was impressive (and we are from "beervana" in the Northwest).  However, 0
My husband and I visited this time share presentation. What was suppose to be a 90 minute presentation turned into 3 hours.  My sister and her boyfriend were with us.   Our Vacation Consultant Janice Spikes had no professional training.  She tried to presser us into buying into their program.  Not to mention she was pushing her own business and churches.  We thanked her for her time, 0
Store front is average at best. You have to walk through the back of the kitchen to get to the male bathroom. The food isnt bad but not great. If you are drunk and at tenya creek they deliver and the more you drink the better the food will seem!, 0
I avoid this place if at all possible. Every time I see somebody or myself buy a tire from this place they give a sob story about how many people are ahead of me for mounting and it can't get done till tomorrow because of man power shortage and what not. The last time the one employee gave me the sob story about how many people were ahead of me for mounting then she asked the tech that does the mounting and he said none, 0

Me n 3 of my friends came here for my birthday....our whole Vegas trip was dedicated to strippers...not only did we pay 30$ to get in...we sat in this club for 3 hours and not one girl talked to any of us...but there was 8 girls sitting on the side not doing anything...we all sat there with stacks in our pockets n left with those stacks in our pockets....on our ride back we were in the car with 7 other people who had the same experience...NEVER AGAIN....when we complained they offered to give us passes to come back....seriously?!?? I don't recommend anyone going here either we will definitely be spending our money elsewhere, 0
Pretty bad.  Super ghetto building, 0
Super slow service. The pretzels were just flat out yucky, 0
Dont buy this lunch Groupon it is a total SCAM!!!  First of all you can only use it for lunch and the place is only open for lunch one day a week on Sundays through the summer until it expires. What a scam!!!! Second of all the service is TERRIBLE...the waiter is a complete idiot and handed us cocktail napkins with out food, 0
So within the past year, 0
Firefly Car Rental Scam Scam Scam  This company was scamming us the first second we walked up to counter. Told us we were late for our reservation. Showed them an email with date and time. Still told us they had no cars and only way to get one was to upgrade.  Scam Scam Scam, 0
The staff here is very helpful, 0
I've been to Vegas a thousand times and I'm always tempted to try this place and I finally gave in. There is nothing special about it. It is overpriced, 0
The KimChee bowl...please take off menu.  As a half Korean I was sorely disappointed...and the shrimp "etouffe" was no where close. I dropped $80 here and expected much more., 0
HORRIBLE PLACE!!!!   got the filet mignon and lobster tail! the lobster tail was HORRIBLE it tasted like rubber way over cooked and too much sauce which gave a horrible nauseous feeling!!  the filet mignon was already had better at cheesecake factory.  The roasted chicken was over cooked and disgusting.  they messed up on the french fries that we had ordered on the side.... it was burnt!!!!!!!!!  the service was horrible.... we saw a waitress maybe once or twice... throughout the night before we were given the check. She never once came by to check on us and the food!!!!!  our main server was the bus boy who got everything and was friendly enough to check on us... unlike the waitress.   we did make reservations and ended up being seated 30 min later as well..  5 star restaurant? I THINK NOT!   THINK AGAIN BEFORE COMING HERE.  our bill came out to 225.  for over cooked food..., 0
I can't really speak to the quality of the rooms or the restaurants here as I didn't stay.  Though from what I can tell from pictures, 0

I am new to Phoenix and have heard about this place so we stopped there for lunch today. It was 110 degrees outside and I would never think any place with no a/c would be open. The place had fans, 0
We came here for Chinese New Year's Dinner with the whole family.  I wasn't too impressed with the food and my stomach told me that as well later on in the night. We had ordered half a suckling pig which was the best thing that was on the table. Everything else seemed overly greasy and even the shrimp fried rice had a funny taste.   Service is what you expect at a typical Chinese restaurant...or rather lack of service. My husband's family ended up buying some of the roast pork to go for dinner last night and it was delicious. Unfortunately, 0
Love this place for their customer service and crepes but, 0
We walked in and placed an order for two smoothies to go.  15 minutes later I received one of them, 0
Did not like this show.......this show was boring to me...the story line was lame..now this review is not for the performers...They are simply amazing and their performance is trully a gift...but I also need something to keep me intrested and this show didnt have it...save your money and see Le Reve instead :), 0
I'm a huge foodie so I guess I'm a pretty tough critic, 0

How is this a 4.5 star hotel?  Far from it.  They offer free valet but it takes them 20-30 minutes to get you your car?  I might as well walk my bags through their mall.  Would have been about the same time, 0
Shockingly bad. The food was a tasteless sloppy mess. Soggy mush. Considering the hotel/casino, 0
You know how when you go to vegas your standards get dramatically lower than normal... that douche wearing Ed Hardy looks sort of attractive, 0
How can this place have so many 4 star reviews? I would rather have McDonalds than this place. The only think edible on the menu is the lettuce cups.   The sushi made me want to gag, 0
This outlet lies way south of the strip and is easily accessible by bus if you don't have car. As for the mall its in decay like many places in Vegas. I got a dimly lit old feel when I walked in. Plenty of shops to go around but the prices aren't any better from the north branch outlet of this outlet. Food court is just a ragtag of chain fast food food joints. Nothing special to try here. If you are looking for outlet prices I would recommend driving all the way down to Primm Valley outlets., 0
I personally think the subs are just so so. My mum likes them however.  So this is the second time I have popped in during the last hour of business to get her a sandwich, 0
If I can rate this place zero stars, 0
The only thing I give this place is for the location it's a nice place to visit. But the service and food was horrible. I would rather spend the money at a nicer place with better customer service. The waitress her name started with a "p" she was dismissive and she didn't really have a lot of tables (I've been a waitress before). It looked like everyone else was serving her food, 0
Good food - chicken curry and tikka sag but horrible -- I repeat HORRIBLE SERVICE! Not coming back again., 0
First off I would like to say they really shouldn't advertise a gluten free menu. When I asked for their gluten free menu, 0

These opening times hold for April - Oct though April - Sept it is open till 5.30.  Winter times lose Thursday and Friday.  The one thing about this castle is that it is a bit of a journey to get to and is over priced.  It will cost an adult \u00a34.20 to get in, 0
No very impressed. Service wasn't great and the food took forever. I could tell the server knew we were unhappy and kept "overly trying" to help us and it ended up being annoying. We won't be back..., 0
I go into this place on a weekly basis. The custard is great and it's so close to home. I'm really not a fan of the manager who interrogated me over my service dog. She stands by my side and is never intrusive or interuptive to others so why the harassment? She is a service dog and has the right to enter the premise along with me so drop the attitude and go back to serving great custard!, 0
Medium food, 0
Worst customer service ever. Drive thru for a simple loaf of bread and they can not get that right. They askec three times if wanted bread sliced and loudly said no three times. Bread sliced and when i go into to get what i ordered not so much as a sorry from supposed" manager". Rather go to a business that puts some effort into customer service., 0
Mediocre at best. The food was very oily (who fries an avocado??) and the service was poor. Unfortunately, 0
I didnt like this buffet! I wont go again. We can buy one meal or 24h, 0
This hotel is good if you come on X-Mas. Buy night, 0
Mehhh. I love pizza and I love NY style pizza but this place just didn't do it for me. My slice was kind of floppy and on the cold side. I didn't think the sauce tasted particularly flavorful and would have liked a little bit of a crispier crust. The lunch specials didn't really seem all that special, 0
We just got home from Native and we will more than likely not return. Food was sub-par & I'm not sure how to describe the service. We sat in the bar area & We ordered drinks from one waitress never to see her again. Then had 4-5 walk past us before one stopped to ask if we were being helped. She retrieved our drinks then never returned. Finally we ordered our food from a 3rd waitress who actually stuck around to bring our food to us. What we got were soggy unflavored wings, 0
If this was my first Brazilian steakhouse experience I would never do it again.  This place had a line out the door so I doubt these negative reviews will make any difference. We had reservations and got seated immediately but everything went downhill from there. The food was fair (meats were good - seafood was a ripoff) but the place was way overcrowded and service was very slow.  Our meal averaged out at 70.00 per person - much better options in Vegas., 0
I had been wanting to try this place for a while as I read it was pretty good. I tried my BBQ favorite in the beef brisket. What a bad move on my part. Their brisket had no seasoning, 0
We were regulars here for years and thought highly of this Kona Grill but since we stopped going there, 0
Nobody likes a downer but all I can do is relay my experience. Every restaurant has an off night but this was pretty disappointing. I've been wanting to eat here for a couple years and we made the trip from the east side all the way to downtown. Sat down and were immediately greeted and I ordered a beer. The server walked away and came back about 5 mins later and asked us if we were ready to order sans beer. As soon as he asked us if we were ready to order you could see that he realized he forgot the beer. No big deal. I work in a restaurant and am very patient as I understand that sometimes shit happens. We order a bottle of wine and a salad and 2 pizzas. He says he'll be back with the beer and the wine and we are totally patient at this point. After about 15 minutes we are still sitting there waiting for our drinks. I can see the bar from where I'm sitting and there is no beer or wine in the service well so it's not like he is too busy to grab it he just never rang any of it in. At this point we look at each other and on cue both stand up and walk out. Ive never done this before but everybody around us honestly looked at us like they wished that they had done the same so their experiences couldn't have been any better. I'm not gonna bash this place and say that it's horrible but I'm just relaying my experience and I won't be back. Personally I'll wait the 3 hours at Bianco where I've never had a bad experience.., 0
Standards are high. Remember when you were in high school, 0
I came here for a venue on Friday night. While the bands were great the service was not! We reserved way ahead of time and were seated in the VIP section. I'm not sure what was so "Very Important' about this section because there were people just walking in and out whenever they felt like it and it became crowded. Some people even crowded in on our section putting there drinks on it and actually spilled all over my seat. The waitress we had came over and took our drink orders but we literally had to hunt her down for the rest of the night trying to get another drink. We spent around $50 on drinks for the two of us (drinking mix drinks) and nether of us had a buzz and started feeling really ripped off.  I'm not sure if its because it was 20 mins of nothing to drink at a time since our waitress never showed up or the fact that the drinks were really, 0
So here is an updated review. After being served with a nasty message on Yelp from one of the server's friends, 0
This was my 2nd time at Wag n Wash.   I walked in at 6:45 PM yesterday, 0
It took me 5 visits to pick up my products and they still gave me the wrong ones. I've called 10 times and no one answered. The voicemail is full. No one is ever in the shop during business hours. Very unprofessional. Worst business ever. Worst customer service. Waste of my time and money. This place is a joke and doesn't even deserve 1 star. Whoever gave a 5 star rating is probably affiliated with the company.  FYI I only put a star to post my review., 0
I see some good reviews for this place, 0
Stay away! After paying a $100 down payment, 0

Save your money- go to Panda Express. That's a shame I feel Panda Express is higher quality than this place. I ordered teriyaki chicken, 0
The food was pretty tasty...and I highly suggest the ice cream tasting - a very unique and fun experience.  But the ambiance of the downstairs patio type area left a lot to be desired... (I was facing escalators & the casino while my boyfriend faced bare black doors).... I think when you are paying $200 for a meal for two you need to bring a phenomenal meal and experience, 0
not good at all !. 11$ a sub !, 0
Alors oui, 0
For as often as I shop at this store you would think they would remember me, 0
I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.  The food was "eh" and I noticed almost everything was served in a bowl, 0
While I have never had tons of luck thrifting I keep holding out for a perfect gently-used mecca and was told this place has a lot of nice designer duds at good prices. I love going to thrift in Chicago because I can generally always find something - but no such luck here.  Perhaps I have to be in more of the searching mood but this place didn't seem to have much that I would pay the amount listed. For example, 0
My kids love this place and I keep getting suckered back in but never again.  Ants on the table was a bit much-and the lack of apology or offer to discount or meal sealed it for me.  This place is banned from my list forever., 0
I decided to go here one morning with my son. He liked it bc there was a lot to choose from. For me offer hand ehhh.....first the owner was very grumpy that morning. I tried to order some type of coffee drink, 0

My friend and I drove from Green Valley planning on getting to the theater with just enough time to park when the previews were about to start.  No luck.  The previews were supposed to start at 10:05 and we were there at 10:02.. all gates locked up and no one around to let us in.  I left my car outside and walked over to the concession area and it was closed.  A girl outside was pretty mad that they had sold her a large drink and popcorn and told her about the free refills and closed 10 minutes later.  Half of the movies had just started and the concessions were closed... doesn't make much sense to me!   We couldn't get in so we parked outside and watched about 1/3rd of Despicable Me before being asked to leave.  It's a nice idea and affordable but make sure to be careful because it's in a really bad part of town., 0
The food here is nothing to brag about. I ordered the chargrilled chicken vampiro and it tasted bland. The sauces that came with it were bitter and ended up dousing my food with salt and pepper hoping it would taste better. The portions were smaller. I'll never come back here again. I felt I wasted my money., 0
Meh.  My standards for quality froyo are high since I frequent Yogurtology (Shea and Scottsdale), 0
I went here today with a friend to get a mani and pedi for only 30$... a really good deal! It was really just an ok experience... the salon is basically in the middle of a bunch of closed store fronts... kind of depressing. The salon isn't very pretty, 0
Absolutely nothing special about this place. Not worth a second visit. It is sad that best moderately priced Italian restaurant is Olive Garden., 0
We went here for happy hour & before a movie around 4pm on a Sunday, 0
Went on the "Ghost Tour" while staying in Edinburgh over New Year's week.  Eh. I dunno. I've been on other ghost tours before in other cities. The group I was with had very high expectations of a supernatural experience and some didn't even come because they thought it would be too scary. I knew it wouldn't be like that. Most of these other tours are basically just walking history tours of the city with a ghost story thrown in. They are never scary. I wasn't expecting much in the way of a scare or an encounter with another world.  On the other hand though, 0
Got a cold. I went here to get some soup n watch the NFL playoff game. Cowboys vs. Detroit.  I ordered the Chicken Noodle soup. It sounds like gourmet soup according to the description. Little did I known. It tasted like soup from a CAN!!!"Canned Soup!" I paid $8 for something I can get at local grocery store for much lesssssss!!!!!! And the Cowboys are Losingggg!!!!! Can I get a break here?!, 0
Slowest service I have ever experienced. Took almost 30 minutes after arriving to get our drinks. Keep in mind this was a Wednesday night with only two other people seated at another table. Good was ok, 0
You do not want to waste your time at Jolly Bob's. Yes it has fun drinks if you can actually get one. The bartender there is plain rude and it takes forever to get a drink. Food if average. Trust me a lot better places in town., 0
This hotel is full of creepy drunks and non drunks and it's suppose to be kid friendly?  I think it's too dark in this hotel.  I just came back from Vegas a few hours ago. I stayed at circus circus as a last minute trip.  The rates are super cheap.  My room was in one of those manors unfortunately. I don't know why it's not even part of the main hotel.  It's a pretty scary and dangerous place to stay especially walking at night or evening for that matter.   It's away from everything.  The signs inside and outside of the hotel were unclear. Looking for the registration desk and stuff was annoying cause it was soo dArk! I mean geez..   When my friend and i walked to our room, 0
I have recently scoured the depths of the internet trying to find a decent review of That's Italiano. It is only AFTER I have returned from eating there that I begin to find information on this restaurant. Humph! I'm a little upset... Joke.  Anyways, 0
Worst Shawarma I've ever had. I thought it was nearly impossible to find bad Shawarma but this was old meat that tasted like it was aged after they shot the animal it was made from by leaving the carcass on the floor for a week. The spiced potatoes had flavor but were undercooked and the price wasn't that great either. I will avoid this place like the plague from now on., 0
Eat there for the view or if you are on Saguaro Lake boating and are really hungry. Service was not stellar; the waiter seems flustered (Sunday of Memorial Day weekend on a lake during May in Arizona, 0

When we walked in I noticed how loud the music was and not only was it loud the sound system was of bad quality. I was literally having to scream to converse with my friends.   It was extremely hot it felt like there was not any air or AC circulating in the place so I was sweating like I had just ran a marathon. When I got home I literally pealed my clothes off!!!!   We start ordering drinks and were just chillin and conversing still sipping on the first set of drinks we had ordered, 0
Most horrible nightclub experience I've had in Las Vegas for last 4 years.  70% of dance floor horny local dudes and hookers.  Bouncers are the rudest I've ever seen.After I deal with them I don't wanna even go inside of Cosmopolitan.  Too sad I feel negative about a whole Casino. Used to be my favorite., 0
it was difficult to get to this place, 0
Certain things were good but only mediocre at most. I was here five days before and after New Years. It's pretty obvious they do not treat their employees well and it comes through no matter how hard "they" try. I won't even go into the broken elevator fiasco here, 0
The actual croissants are good but only if you like plain ones. Very little filling in the sweet ones, 0
Much less than expectation...especially considering the price!! Choice isn't even big, 0
My first trip to the Carnival Buffet and I can say it will be my last visit there. On the plus side the prime rib was pretty good with atomic horseradish sauce. The rest was truly forgettable. Many items were greasy, 0
While traveling to Austin for a conferee I had a strong craving for fro yo. Lucky for me there was a place within walking distance of the hotel.  Compared to the fro yo I'm used to in Austin this isn't good. The flavors are basic with no creativity and the taste is just okay. The consistency when it comes out of the machine is a little weird and not smooth like I'm used to.  I had the Vanilla bean and dark chocolate with PB chips, 0
Drive thru line was not moving at all. Left to In N Out. There were at least 10 cars in line and the parking lot was otherwise empty, 0

One word. GHETTO!  I have never been to a grocery store where you have to go outside to get a cart and then push it through a gate and walk through a little turn-style type thing to get into the grocery store. Weird. I guess it is to prevent the homeless from stealing the carts, 0
AVOID MEAT DEPARTMENT. Bad Service. Poor quality seafood and meats. Manager does not offer any help.  Good Produce sale on Wed.  Do not expect any customer service from Meat Dept and Store Manager., 0
Do NOT eat here! The food is okay, 0
Very slow service at 3pm even if it was after lunch hours....it took 30 minutes to serve my food, 0
Creepy bar scene hahahaha Good thing I was in good company.  The drinks were strong at least, 0
Today I was fairly unimpressed with Sweet Tomatoes. I just recently went for my first time.  I walk in 11:45am Sunday and the salad bar was not stock what that with lunch starting.  The food was not that good, 0
found a hair in my food. maybe a hairnet or two might help. The outdoor seating is really sidewalk seating next to the parking lot and cars. Would vote lower if the option were available., 0
I posted an earlier review of this hotel/casino and still am very impressed with the physical plant and the great drinks at the chandelier bars. However, 0
Stick to the pizza. I ordered a sub sandwich and french fries( which were a extra fee). The sand which was small with barley any meat and the fries, 0

Maybe this place and I got off on the wrong foot, 0
Way older crowd slow service leaving now, 0
Would like to see that the handicap parking revised. Currently you have to walk the entire length of the restaurant to the park your car. It's quite far.   Service was extremely slow, 0
$3.79 for the small blizzard. Really??!   I laughed when I saw the size as I picked it up through the drive-thru. I guess it's just been a long time since I've had a blizzard.   Dang! Guess I won't be getting one of those again for a while. (Which is probably a good thing.), 0
"Picazzo's?" More like "van Garlic." We had the hummus/dolomades appetizer which was WAY overwhelmed by the taste of raw garlic. And the puttanesca pizza on the organic whole grain crust. Again all I could taste was garlic.  Not that I have anything against garlic, 0
My family liked this place.  I did not. I thought t was dirty and the service very poor. My wife loved her omelette.  My kids their breakfasts.  I am not a breakfast guy, 0
It's 11:30 at night went to check into the hotel after a long 6 hour drive an was denied a hotel room because I dot have a credit card. I explained to to him I had more than enough cash an he questioned me as to why I had so much an told me he couldn't do anything WILL NEVER be staying at a comfort inn ever again, 0
Molly B. The only way to make my experience more enjoyable is to refund me about 200.00 that your business over charged me., 0

Tiniest sushi ever. Pass on doh. Didnt do all you can eat and did the ala carte nigiri. The size for 4$ a piece was insulting. Walked by a table who was doing AYCE and low and behold their pieces were normal size. The guy kept trying to talk us into AYCE but being it was our first time I wasnt trying to commit to 26 bucks a person when I wasnt sure of the quality. The pork belly was WAY over done and was dry. The sake on the menu under gingo lists a $20 bottle thats 720 ml but when we ordered it he delivered a 300 ml bottle and said it was a "mistake on the menu" WHAT?! THEY SHOULD AT LEAST CROSS THAT OUT. Horrible experience. No. Just no., 0

I come get all the time and yes the bagels are very good but the staff could be a little friendlier. Also they had OVER an hour yet to close and they looked like they were closing.  The chairs were stacked on all the tables towards the back. You  don't start stacking you're chairs that early.  Where's the customer service.  There is none... and that's too bad because I really love the bagels there...., 0
I don't think I would come here again.  The ladies working here are rude and have absolutely no sense of customer service.  OK so it is Valentine's Day and you are busy.  Well as a florist you should expect to be busy on Valentine's Day, 0
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!!!! I have been a member with Wells Fargo since 2006 and WITHOUT FAIL every 6 months or so I receive charges that should not have been there. And EVERY TIME I go to this branch to resolve a problem every team member has an attitude and ends up telling me there is nothing we can do about it!!!! I just had an issue today and it was the straw the broke the camels back. I am now a proud member of the Chase Bank right across the street!!!!!, 0
Big Mistake.  Apparently none of the workers at this hotel feel that they have a job to do.  When first room was not exceptable contacted front desk she gave me a new room at 159.00 total for room cost.  Lateron found out this was a upgrade charge.  I specificially asked her 4 times if this was the total room charge.  She said yes.  Bonk not so!!! In my attempt to correct this I have been on the phone 22 times to correct this and being on hold the majority of these conversations of up to 15 minutes. My phone was also stolen by the individual across the hall.  it was outside my door.  However Sgt Robertson who I spoke to told me this was not lost and found.  And no one told him about it!!! Go back to playing solitare moron!  Checking in and Checking out  has extremely long lines and very unorganized.  To get to the pool is a major walk.  Rather stay at the travel lodge with the pool outside the door.  MGM is so yesterday!, 0
WORST DINNER EVER!  I could write a thousand words on this but i will keep it short.  *Gave them two hours advance notice we had a party of 20, 0
I took my car in to get an oil change and to check out some rattling I was experiencing at high speeds. Everyone was incredibly nice here and I was excited because I thought maybe I had found a new (closer) place to take my car. They called me after having my car for several hours saying I needed a list of things done, 0
Where can I start with this place? I don't even know where to begin...  First of all, 0
This is a very large buffett, 0
DO NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE!!!!  Worst customer service in Las Vegas. NEVER stay in the north tower. The rooms are old and smell like smoke. The AC unit sounds like it was having a securer every 3 minutes and if you decide to stay around Halloween time beware of the traffic nightmare getting or out of the parking garage.  The staff will not tell you these things when you check in and they will not compensate you for your loss. Recommend you stay away from this property.  Slots are ultra tight and table games are hard to find., 0
Before I start on The Bank...I would like to note that I had heard many great things about it prior to going...and therefore would like to think this was a very off night for them...   The 2 main reasons the Bank didn't live up to expectations: --This place is a small club with a big club mind set - as in they will fill it til they can't fill it no mo. That meant that I was constantly smooshed against someone else...everywhere - on the stairs, 0

Also found out that the day I ordered my pizza ( Tuesday ) they have buy one get one free pizza if you buy a large or Xlarge...but because I did not specifically ask for it, 0

The Silverton is not what it use to. It is tight tight tight on the machine's for anyone to win anymore. If your not sitting in the right section you will not get a drink. You can hear cocktail drinks but no one come in the sections your playing your favorite machine.  Tacky and makes no sense of the work when it comes to servicing your client who come to spend money to keep this dam casino industry alive. Company only thinks of there money coming in, 0

The food is good but I do not understand how no one has addressed how slow and disorganized they are here. Still sitting here an hour later and we haven't gotten all of our food. Staggering is one thing but the first two came out after about 20 minutes, 0
Awful Awful service!!!  Not from the actual technician but the representative who fields the calls.  I was supposed to have them come do maintenance on my air conditioning unit last Thursday.  This is after they already did two service calls from my home warranty.  Their diagnosis was was that I needed maintenance on the unit.  So I agreed to a service contract, 0

I came here with high expectations since so many friends recommended it. However, 0
Avoid. I went to see this dentist about tmj. I paid $75 for consultation (which most dentist waive or apply toward treatment) for him to tell me he couldnt recommend any treatment until alignment issues where corrected with my chiropractor. He also sold me a temporary nite guard (the Aqualizer) for another $75. One which you can buy online for $25. One month later the night guard popped and i called in to the dentist to advise. The response was buy another or you should have come back sooner. Both the receptionist and the dentist preferred to lose a patient over an item that would have cost them peanuts to replace or rectify the situation somehow. The dentist actually insisted that i was paying more for his "EXPERTISE" even though i paid his "expertise" separately. Well he can keep it, 0
i REALLY wanted to like this show.  I've been watching Holly since her girls next door days and was excited to see what her life had become in Vegas..   The show isn't actually all bad... it has it's funny moments.. however few there may be... but overall it's borderline cheesy.  Yes, 0
No wonders only two and a half stars on this location. My family and I went to this restaurant on Monday night around 10 pm. for late night dinner. There is my daughters and I. We sat in dinning area and ordered some appetizers to start because we were waiting for a few friends to join us. Food came around 10-20 mins after I'd ordered. Food was ok so that I planed to order cookie skillets for my daughters while I was waiting for my friends....BUT.... The server came and mention that we have to leave by 11:00 pm. We're not even finished our food yet!!!  Five minutes later they sent one guy to our table and said that we have to leave!!! He said Zipps's policy not allow anyone under 21 around the building after 11:00 pm. My daughters were so upset either do I .....   Why don't they put the policy on the wall or at less let us know when we got there not just KICK us out!!!   So disappointed, 0
I say this will all love.. because I know that this place is in a really terrible location so they do everything they can to attract people... but it is just god awful.  First off, 0
SCAMS!!   went here for a bachelor party. bouncers treat you like crap and demand tips. then at end of the night, 0

STK is one of several happening spots in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel.  What makes this place unique is the dj blasting music throughout the restaurant (don't go for quiet conversation or a romantic dinner).  I wasn't there for either and enjoyed the old school r&b while dining.  The vibe was further enhanced by the great visuals.  This spot is pretty popular so there's no shortage of great looking women.  Unfortunately the food and service didn't live up to the hype.  Like so many popular restaurants in vegas they overbook like crazy.  Our casino host joined us for dinner and we still waitied an hour and a half to get seated despite our reservation.  The rib eye was just average (I prefer the rib eye at botero - especially with their chimmichuri sauce).  The tab came to ~$450 for four and that included a bottle of wine.  Good thing the meal was comped by the casino.  Wouldn't pay to dine there.  note: I dined there 2/4 which was a very busy super bowl weekend., 0
I stopped coming here when I realized I could afford to pay more than $99/night for a room in Vegas.  You're stuck at the end of the Strip, 0

I took my husband's shirts to be pressed and cleaned and they came back with more wrinkles than they originally had. They are also more expensive than most places in the area. Their only advantage is the drive thru., 0
Customer service at this hotel is awful and the whole entire place is overpriced. Here's my experience short n sweet. I stayed there is 2011 a couple of times. Payed $100+ per night for this so called 4 star hotel and casino (not even close to that) Anyway I have been receiving emails since then saying I have 2 comp. Nights.I just called and talked to a rude customer service agent and she said that she couldn't find that deal and said basically I was exaggerating. When I come to Vegas I like to go big and have a good time. So let's just say I have spent a decent amount of money with Mlife. Well I guess this is how they do business and I will never stay at a Mlife casino again and will never drop one penny in any of their casinos. Great job u just lost a loyal customer. Maybe send your customer service good squad to the Bellagio to learn the real way to stand by your advertisements and don't try to bait and switch someone that is ahead in the game. Stay away from these guys!! Hope this helps, 0
We had 7pm reservations. Sat out on the balcony. Nice view of the area. The service started off very well. Had the 2010 Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon. It was a nice wine. Had the scallops as a starter. Very nicely done. Had the tomohawk rib eye and lobster surf-n-turf.  Very nice presentation. Lobster was excellent. Rib eye tasted kind of bland for what I paid.  Than they forgot about us. Requested support from other staff members but because we weren't their customer, 0
awful.  Food was not good; small portions and prepared poorly.  Atmosphere was WAY too noisy even for a sports-bar type place ...we couldn't hear each other talk.  Pretty girls can't make up for terrible food. won't be back., 0

I'll go to Saks or Neimans just to not deal with his funky attitude., 0

Let me start by saying that I did not have to pay for food at this buffet.  My hotel package included daily access, 0
Terrible. Waitress was a sad sack of sh**. The "handheld" we got was ridiculous and awful. Waitress was slow and discriminating on me for being with another guy. How do I know. The people beside us said she was. Will never come here again. And all my gay friends won't come here either. Absolutely awful., 0

The location is the only good thing this hotel has going for it. I have stayed here 2 times.  The room was very clean, 0
I work downtown and made a special trip to the Southside location for lunch with my sister. I have been to the Oakland location and enjoyed the entire experience- food and customer service- so I was looking forward to lunch. My actual meal was fine (American Grill burger and fries). It was the customer service that left much to be desired. My sister ordered a custom salad. She had an important phone call come through and asked me to finish her order. The girl making the salad (Caitlin) was extremely unfriendly. Rudely asking "what else" and acting annoyed when I had to think about it (mind you - the place was NOT busy at all so it's not like I was holding up a line). When we came to the end of the line, 0
The place is pretty, 0
Very good eggs benedict, 0
Horrible experience...filled out my application made it clear on what I wanted and how much I had as a down. Finance guy comes back with a down of 4-5 times what I had told them what I had.

Two words: MAYO and Bread. Too much mayo and the bread is stiff. I can make the same sandwich at home and that doesn't say much for Jimmy John's. I've ordered from here and I've been in the store. Yes you are left to fend for your own bag, 0
A long time customer of Lotus. This past Friday I went for the lunch buffet by myself. A 20 minute wait no problem.  My disappointment was the wait staff.  No water or beverage was offered.  I finally got up and took a glass from a water station and helped myself.  The buffer while ok was not monitored and refilled timely.  I made two separate trip 15 min apart for the green chicken curry. Neither time was it refilled. Just a few sad pieces of zucchini floating in sauce.  The same applied to the tempera.  Staff did not acknowledge me or two other tables.  When I went to pay I told the cashier and she said with no concern we are busy.  I said hire more help. You can afford it.  I'll be skipping lunch at Lotus of Siam., 0

This is the type of place you can say "yeah I've been there" and then never return to again. Despite the mixed reviews I have seen on here, 0
I'm wondering if it is even worthwhile for me to write a review of my home airport.  It's not like there's a better airport in town for me to fly out of.  I also doubt that the owner of Charlotte-Douglas Airport is going to read my review and send me an email apologizing for his business' poor service and terrible product like a restaurant owner would do.  Writing an airport review is as futile an effort as catching wind with a net, 0
Great look to this place. And as the "hidden" comments say, 0
The sushi here is not very tasty. Every kind of sushi we ordered basically had 'California Roll' in it. I got a Spicy Tuna Roll and the Spicy Tuna looked artificial and not normal. I've tasted much better sushi at other places., 0
Please slit my throat already! I've gotta say this location could use a little bit of customer service skills building courses. i know you work for the govt (us) but I'm pretty sure your not making the peanuts most of the people outside this building are making working way harder. The overall attitude of this place is dreary. Thanks to Mesa (javelina office) having technical difficulties with their driver's license printers I had to come here for it instead. They put it in the computer but of course no one here knows anything about the other branch having any issues so you have to pretty much start all over. I was so glad to get my driver's license after an hour wait so I could go to my car and weep over the loss of an hour of my existence I'll never get back and probably wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night from having these memories of being stuck in this black hole. Is it just me or does this place rock!, 0
Interesting place.  Worst service in Scottsdale.  Prices are ridiculous - $25.00 per glass of unknown cabernet.  Better to go to Fifth and Wine.  Rip-offs., 0
Just had to pick up some stamps and i was with my mom waited in line for like 5-10mins. Once we got to the teller we asked for a roll of stamps and post card stamps.   The employee was being a bitch and complaining that she had to go to the back and get more stamps (then go get them and stop complaining) . My mom asked can we get some Eco friendly stamps, 0

My friends and I have always loved the Happy Hour in the bar but I was disappointed last night to find out the menu has changed and our favorite beef and horseradish sandwich is no longer offered. My friend and I sat at the bar and we were surprised when the bartenders ignored us after they had served our beers. We finally had to ask for some food and although we both tried different items from the new menu, 0
My party was seated very quickly because, 0
I had such high hopes and was so excited to try this place. First experience was on a Monday night and they were hoppin'. Live music and all. Service was good but my meal lacked. I thought it was perhaps my menu choice so I gave it a second shot. Yet again I was disappointed in my food. Always love good chips and salsa pre-meal which they have. Good atmosphere, 0
I don't see the hype surrounding this place. My friends and coworkers are obsessed so I've had both the lunch and dinner menu and I'm sorry to say the emperor has no clothes. I'm not a picky eater and don't expect perfection, 0
6 years or so ago I would come to this mall every once in a while and I don't remember it being too bad.  Then again I was a college student new to Arizona and I may have just been naive.  The other day I walked in the front door and immediately starting planning how soon I could leave.  The place just has an over-run flea market atmosphere.  I noticed a few generic clearance stores, 0

Took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed. The chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet. We got a barbecue pork dish and some beef dish that both had a bland gravy. A huge platter of pot stickers that got everyone excited but ended up being ... bland. Even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce. The calamari was not tough. I'll give them that. If this is the best Chinese food around... I'm sorry., 0

I've given Evo Cafe far more chances than it deserves. The food is hardly considered passable. The last time I was here, 0
Worst KFC I have ever been to. Takes forever. If they have to handle at least 4 customers prepare to wait at least minimum of a half hour for your fast food. They overcharge you, 0
Ordered Togo for the first time and the pho was disgusting. I had to throw it out. Very disappointed and will not go back., 0
Awful food and awful service.  I would recommend you skip this location and keep driving to the Happy Valley location where the food and service are great! Sitting with two small children, 0
I decided to make an appointment here after seeing the Yelp $25 off special for 1st time customers.  Big mistake.  I had full highlights done by Lauren and although we reviewed ahead of time what I liked and was looking for, 0
The food had no flavor.  It's a very generic Americanized version of Italian food.  It tastes very similar to the Macaroni Grill.  The bread had to be soaked in olive oil to taste good otherwise it tasted a little stale.  The tomato sauce tastes similar to a bottled sauce you can get at any grocery store. There was nothing authentic or homemade tasting about the sauce. The portions were generous and the prices were nice.This is a not an authentic NY style or Sicialian style restaurant with flavor. When we dined there at 6 PM on a weekday, 0
Not impressed with this restaurant at all. Their menu is small, 0
came here for lunch this past weekend with a group of 8. Service was s-l-o-w, 0
One of the worst places I have ever been to. The service is horrific and the server named Chuong is terrible. I made 3 simple requests and he still could not carry it out. The food is decent. Would not recommend, 0
I kept walking past this place over the last couple of days and decided to look it up on Yelp.  What I found was one review that started with "I have never eaten here."  I quickly realized it was my duty to check Ginza out and give it a proper review, 0
I was excited to try this place since it has lots of reviews and 4 stars. I figured it must be good!  It is a rarity that I find Yelp to be inaccurate based on the ratings of others.  I was extremely disappointed!   The lady who seated us and waited on us was blatantly rude.  I have never had such terrible service, 0
Took my fianc\u00e9 here and was a little disappointed with the level of service. Receptionist was nice. Doctor was not nice. Had heard good things but was not impressed. Will give her one more shot and re review., 0
Bar Alba looks really nice and fancy from the outside, 0
The lady at the Phoenix Visitors Center highly suggested we check this place out. They have a few of the basic stores you are likely to find in any mall, 0
The woman who answered my call was very rude! Nuff said., 0
I know part of it is that I'm just tired of the whole Cirque do Soleil thing, 0
I really liked staying at the Luxor until now. I recently stayed at the Luxor for two days and the room was dirty and it had been neglected cosmetically. The walls had dents, 0
Don't really care for their garlic fried rice.  Soaked with butter and u can taste the raw garlic., 0
The course itself is beautiful and decently challenging ehich id the only reason I'm not rating this 1 star. They also have a 36 hole frisbee golf course (not as challenging), 0
Perhaps it was just the cakes I chose, 0
Spa SUCKS!  After 3 long days walking and working KBIS I bought an hour long foot massage for my husband.   The "masseuse" was 10 minutes late ... massaged his feet for 20 min. Then told him to relax and take a nap.   She rolled back in on the hour to tell him he was done ... $100 ?  NOT GOOD !  Want money back for THAT service.   Certainly not worth the time OR $.  Too bad :-(, 0
Well if I could give them 0 stars I would .  If you want to safe yourself a problems please get someone else. If you have any question please contact me., 0
This Subway is inside the Orleans hotel/casino, 0
Car was broken into.  Found out this is a regular occurrence.  When I spoke with the General Manager I was told too bad, 0
This is a new location from the same owners of the Luna Rossa at Lake Las Vegas.  I have never been to the original location but had a TERRIBLE experience today at the Downtown/Fremont Street location. I went with two other people and we ordered the meatball sandwich, 0
After reading mixed reviews, 0
WOW! We come here roughly every few months especially to show off Town Square to people that are not from Las Vegas. We usually get excellent service with excellent food. Tonight was just BAD! Not only did the manager feel he needed to argue with us and embarrass us in front of our guest, 0
Stopped in here because I saw it whilst driving past, 0
I have just moved back to Las Vegas and swore that I would get out of my structured box and try new things so instead of going to Popeye's for chicken which I love, 0
This was my favorite dive bar back when I thought a dive bar had to be absolutely rank. I recently returned a few times after years of having been away and realized why i had stayed away so long.   The service varies depending who your server is. The beer is awful. Just a shitty selection. Really effing shitty. I seemed to remember their buffalo chicken strips being delicious but I must have been drunk out of my goddamned gourd. They were dry and had almost no sauce. Oh and don't listen to what anyone may tell you...LandShark is not tasty beer.  I also remembered why this is the only bar I have been kicked out of for getting into altercations. Almost all of the patrons were ass hats speaking total douchery and making me sick to my stomach as they used their smooth lines on the waitress such as "Why don't you want to go home with my friend? He is hung like a horse. Har har har"  Never have I been to a bar with so many children seated at the booths. "You have a baby!...at a bar..."  "OK so why two stars Nathan?" you may be asking yourself, 0
I've gone two times-that will be probably be it.  The first time I ordered the italian beef/italian sausage combo.  It was decent-nothing spectacular.  It was around $7.00-no fries.  The next time I went, 0
Disappointing and mistreated, 0
It smelled amazing when we walked in, 0
Worst tortilla soup I have ever it tasted it was like a hot bowl of salsa plain and simple. If I would have been given chips I may have eaten it. The server was really cute and attentive but she had no clue what to suggest for a non meat eater I was struggling to find anything appealling here. She finally suggested a salad. It was good it had candied walnuts and dried cranberries w goat cheese on it but by the time I got it everyone had eaten and I stole a bunch of their fries so I couldnt eat the whole colassal salad. I just read Dallas' review I wish the girl would have suggested their veg burger sad. I might go back if I had to. I used to live at Zipps years ago but mainly for the football and booze not the food meh., 0
It was an okay place to grab a few drinks. The prices where good. What I really didn't like was that when I checked my bank statement they had added an additional tip for themselves on top of mine. Be careful here., 0
I got home one day and one of their menus was at the door. Ordered and here's my experience:  The lady who answers the phone is not very well-versed in customer service. English is obviously not her first language and the way she responds when she doesn't understand you just comes off rude.  The pizza was undercooked, 0
We stayed here for my son's birthday. He didn't like being up so high in the hotel. Our room smelled like stale cigs and was supposed to be non smoking....rightttttt...the location was way further down from the strip than I anticipated.   Our room was clean, 0
We went to "THE PLACE" for breakfast/lunch today. It must be a popular spot and was very busy. There were 2 specials of the day, 0
Could not find out what was wrong with me. Bad bedside etiquette. Never found out what was wrong with me after 20 visits, 0
Purchased a Groupon to try the restaurant. Seemed like a great way to try out a new restaurant at a good price. The decor was outdated. Its very old and has no dining atmosphere..The service and food was ok. The problem came when we received the bill. It seems that the wait staff decides what amount to tip. The waiter took it upon himself to give himself a $30 tip which was the full  20%. He brought the check with the tip added into the bill before I had a chance to decided for myself. I am NOT opposed to tipping, 0
Mainstream/overrated. Waited 2 1/2 hours just to get into tiesto. . Go to the neighboring clubs forsure. If you are a women trying to wear heels, 0
Went here because Guy said it was good. Big MISTAKE!  Here's what we had:  $1.75 dinner salad - all wet half head iceberg ($.50 extra for ranch) $12.99 steak and shrimp - massacred new york steak, 0
Nosh & Swig was pretty empty when we popped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We were shocked with how dirty everything was. The tables had cleaning rags on them, 0
Sadly it seems as if this brand has meet is dimise.  It was good while it lasted and even though we only eat there twice it was good and I'm sorry to see it go, 0
Worst experience ever. We planned to stay 3 nights. When we first walked in the Ac filter looked like it hadn't been changed in 2 years. The quickly replaced it. Then the AC broke. Instead of putting us in a new room they sent someone to fix it hours later and it didn't work. Then it took about another 5 hours to get us a new room. The new room had a huge leak in the sink and water went everywhere. On top of that the pool by our room flooded and they closed it. Then another pool was closed for a private party. The main pool was disgusting. Was super cloudy had floating bandaids and dead bees everywhere. Then I went to speak with a manager and check out and no manager or assistant manager or any one of authority was available to speak with. I will never stay here again. It is also in a rundown part of town., 0
Not sure if they are closed for good or temporarily.  There were posters stuck up on their door with building code violations of some sort.  It looks like they are either packed up and left or undergoing maintenance for the violations., 0
First off the casino had a horrible chemical smell. I'm not sure if they were doing construction or if it always smells like the inside of a cleaning bottle. When the sushi arrived it looked a bit lacking. I hoped the taste would make up for the size, 0
Well since Yelp asked... My experience here was poor. I are here a year ago and had an amazing meal. Could not wait to check it out when I was in Vegas last week. Same meal was way worse. My steak was dry and flavorless. It was a huge disappointment. Since there are many steak options in this city. I wouldn't chance it if I were you., 0
Eh this place is ok for takeout once in a while. Breakfast is ok eggs are the only thing they can cook consistently. Staff is usually nice but way to chatty and a bit slow, 0
I am not impressed with Blue lemon. I give it one star for the awesome decor but besides there is nothing much to it. The food was not that good and although it did come out fast I would rather take my ten dollars else were., 0
I've been here twice and was not impressed.  The rolls are so small, 0
Food is not cheap in Vegas anymore but at least it is usually decent. Not this place, 0
It's a Taco Bell. Certainly you haven't come here with Rick Bayless expectations, 0
BLARK! The red pepper chicken sandwich I had was disgusting.  No choice of a side, 0
We ordered a couple items for takeout - Goi Cuon (Summer Roll 2), 0
I absolutely don't get the draw of this place.  I really try to see things in as positive a light as possible, 0
I don't know where to start with this place...when it opened we were super excited like everyone else because there are NO restaurants in this area of Henderson...so the first month it opened we just had to go...Service was sooooo bad I almost walked out...and I am a server so if MY patience had worn thin, 0
Took my daughter to her first pro baseball game. Before the game, 0
Another Groupon victim here people.  What a disappointment. Didn't even claim our second Groupon and just declared it a loss ! The Navajo taco is a brilliant concoction in which they fail miserably.   I think they shut their fryer down at noon !  I was so excited about a new Fry Bread location but their was one server ( the owner ) and it took forever to get our meals- and the place was empty.  I was so disappointment - the fry bread was cold, 0
It took my wife and I one hour to check it. We walked into our first room to find the bed without sheets. We first thought, 0

Club sucks..... They let too many people in and the security sucks. Worst experience ever. I felt bad for the people that didn't have VIP because it is impossible to get drinks., 0
I wouldnt even give one star to this place!! Horrible stinky outdates rooms! Old tvs with missing remote control, 0
Breakfast - Overpriced and Overcooked  I have been a long time fan of this restaurant for its BBQ so I decided to try their breakfast.  The even with a steep $9 price tag, 0
this place makes me want to kick someone in the face! how can it takes 2 workers 15 minutes to make a passion fruit ice tea with NO ONE in line?! or ... are they really making my ice tea in the back....?! this place is horrible! horrible service, 0
***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***  Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.  In terms of the menu, 0
I couldn't agree with Courtney P. more. Instead or ordering an Omelet here ask for a stick of butter. It will taste the same!  If you do decide to go I would only indulge in crepes. The Oakland location is overrun with Pitt freshman....for a better Pamela's experience hit up the one in Shadyside. And on Sunday get there before 11 or you will never be seated!, 0
Say "BITES." Say "WINGS."  Apparently, 0
Only reason I gave them 1 star is their Sports Book.  Completely unprofessional and rude, 0
I wouldn't classify this place as an Italian restaurant.  It is more like an east-coast eatery.  They serve cheese steak and beer and oily garlic bread and chicken wings.  Stuff like that.  My polla al limone was different from how I've had it prepared at actual Italian joints.  The lemon flavor was almost imperceptible, 0
Ordered a bacon cheeseburger pan pizza from here. The pizza was ten minutes later than the time said it would take to get here, 0
My experience at this restaurant was not very pleasant at all. First off, 0
About the same as the other locations for Rock Bottom in the Phoenix area, 0
Not a huge fan.  I got the roast beef panini and could have whipped up a better one myself.  Literally toasted bread, 0

I'm here trying to get me some Tuesdays wings . Yet server is taking forever! I'm not exaggerating I promise! Lemondade tastes like pure sugar! but ask me if I had the chance to return . . . NO! why? Cause server hasn't come to our table. restaurant is busy.... but seriously it really take ages to bring me soda. If it wasn't for the actual taste of the wings and food. I would never return ! Aggggh so disappointed ! :((, 0

Extraordinarily inconsistent. Ordered three pizzas to go this week. Two literally had four inches between the edge of the pizzas and where the toppings started. Paid $10 a piece for a crust!  Sent a note to the manager through Brixx's website...  Several days later, 0

Great food - great wine suggested by the sommelier.   Nice, 0
A cup of Ice for $3!  Are you Kiddin' me?   Three tacos for $5 is a good deal! A can of Soda for $1 not a bad deal... But when you order the lemonade for $3, 0
Birthday signup we got the $30 gift card and went over mid week.  Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.   But the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade., 0

My frustration with the service and attitude of the servers was an experience I hope no one else receives. I was hoping to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere accompanied with an experience of outstanding culture food. The food was satisfactory !   But the constant need for a server was non existent . There were four other tables occupied  and have to wonder why only two servers- poor planning on your part., 0

Went in on Halloween day with my husband and got so extremely sick within an hour of leaving.  Had a burrito bowl with salsa and ended up with severe food poisoning.  Wanted to try this spot as I pass it all the time.  First red flag was an employee emptying container after container of store bought guacamole in a container to serve as their own.  Second red flag was the cleanliness of the salsa bar.  Bummer to miss Halloween but happy I'm alive.  Hopefully this was an isolated incident.  I definitely won't return....EVER!, 0
I thought priority mail is 2 days guarantee.. Now i found out its bs.. There is no guarantee for delivery.. Absolute bs.., 0
Don't recommend this place at all. Pick a different place unless you are just going for their happy hour deals which are extremely cheap! Felt that this was very generic. Go to another place., 0

Agh!  Ordered a bagel with cream cheese and thought it was the jalapenos that were funky til I realized the cream cheese was SOUR!!!! If they are not busy enough to sell plain cream cheese before it sours..., 0
2.4/5  - How can you make Mexican food without any flavor?  Ordered the BBQ pork burrito. Heard a lot about and read a lot of great reviews about this amazing BBQ pork. Turns out it is shredded pork with a very bland ketchup/honey sauce on it. I understand it's a chain and you aren't going to smoke the pork or anything that would add flavor during the cooking process but to skimp out and get the cheapest tasting BBQ sauce? Why even try? The other meat choices are shredded beef, 0
Dishonest. Unpleasant. Bad service. Work is "spotty". They will not come back to rework a house once the check clears. Stay away., 0
I guess my expectations were a bit too high for such an expensive place.  We made reservations for our anniversary dinner. In general, 0

The shu mai is not that good. The noodle soups (mami) are ok. The chicken was a total let down. I do not really get this place. The food is not that great. Way too over rated for me. I would not go out of my way to go to this place., 0
DO NOT GO THERE...GO TO TO AN ER OR THE URGENT CARE JUST 3 BLOCKS NORTH of them.  The actual MD's are OK for basic stuff but are questionable on other things.  Their OFFICE STAFF ARE RUDE AS HECK!!!  Not helpful, 0
This club was a major disappointment, 0
Brian was the rudest person I've ever delt with especially because I'm a woman. I want an oil change that's all I need. Not new tires I have a new car. He kept trying to up sale me. My car was towed here and they had the keys he kept trying to take the keys to my other car and didn't understand what keys were for what car. He wouldn't listen rolled his eyes and was beyond rude. Then lost my keys for my car. Then acted like using my boyfriends rewards card was illegal. Worst service ever. I was highly recommended here to talk to some one else and won't be returning due to his attitude. Treated me like a pos because he lost my keys that were already there., 0
This review is specifically about Tumi Warranty repair.    Mark's is a preferred repair service for Tumi.  I recently sent a Tumi bag from Seattle for repair.  This briefcase was sold to me as having a lifetime warranty.    A side zipper failed, 0

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT A RESTAURANT! This is so disappointing to have to write about. This last summer our family and my husbands family bought vacation homes in Fountain Hills. My husbands family was visiting from England and I told them we should definitely stop by the Vu. I had been there once and the views and food were delicious.   This time we arrived at 8pm and there were just a couple tables there of people. No music this time (last time it was fabulous) but it was a Thursday. We ordered a few drinks and they came pretty quickly. We also ordered food and that was a problem all together.   We ordered a caprese salad, 0
This place is close to my home and we thought of giving this a try this mother's day. It was 1:00 P.M and the place was packed. We were seated promptly but had to wait 10 minutes to even get a glass of water. Maybe they just forgot or were just too busy. I dont know. Coming to food. Their soup was good (I ordered Tomato and my wife ordered Minestrone). It came out quickly after placing the order. The main course (veggie roasted sandwich and Penne pasta in roma sauce) was totally meh! I mean it was not hot (probably sitting on the counter to be served or wasn't prepared well). They served us garlic bread which ironically had no garlic or hint of it (and it was cold). This was my first time at this restaurant...and probably the last time as well., 0
OK so I am NOT a happy camper. I was here not long ago for my hubby's birthday. We booked a room well in advanced. There wasn't anything wrong with our reservation upon arrival. However, 0
I was up the street for an event and snuck away because I was STARVING. The BBQ place was sold out if everything, 0
We dined last night. When we entered we asked the hostess for a table on the patio by a heat lamp. She said that would be no problem. We get out to the patio and all the heat lamps are bundled together and off. I see her tinker with one and then walk away. A few minutes later our server approached our table and took our drink orders. We mentioned the heat lamps and he said the owner was probably fixing them for us. (We had two kids with us who were freezing). Just as our drinks arrived another table was sat. The hostess/owner came back out to the patio and started to fix the heat lamps by the NEW table. We ordered our food and said if we could not get a heat lamp we would like to move inside. For the next 15 minutes the owner set up and got working two heat lamps for the new table. Once our food arrived she came over and started on ours. I felt like a second rate citizen. We mentioned that it was cold and she said it was because we were drinking margarita's. I said the kids were not drinking margaritas and their hands were freezing she said they should have gotten up and warmed them by the fire pit. With this kind of hospitality from the OWNER I won't need to ever dine here again., 0

OK.. Gyro's are one of my favorite foods EVER. These Gyros were super weird. My coworker and I were both disappointed. The meat was a lamb/beef mix that tasted like cumin. It was a very weird seasoning choice and nothing a Gyro should ever contain. The fries were amazing though. Not worth the $9 quite honestly. I won't go back and I am suprised by the raving reviews. I will go to Greek Isles next time.. that place is the BOMB!, 0

They have good prices. That's about it for the pros.  Cons: ABYSMAL customer service. Terrible. The employees have two possible states: they can appear to be inconvenienced by your presence, 0
The customer service at this particular Walgreens is horrendous - from both the checkout counter to the pharmacy.  Never have I experienced such a lackluster attitude towards customers.  I'm generally a fan of Walgreens but I will drive the extra mile to avoid this particular Walgreens., 0
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible. Called in to order and was told it'd arrive within 45 mins. 2 he's passed and we didn't receive anything. Guy on the phone had the audacity to tell us delivery man was downstairs at our hotel and due to "hotel policies" he couldn't come up to our room they could only do one at a time. So I went downstairs and surprise surprise...no delivery guy was there I asked concierge and they didn't know of any delivery guy "waiting" to deliver. So I called again to cancel and the guy on the phone RUDELY said "okay but if you don't leave a note we will charge your room" DONT BELIEVE THEM! They can't do that!, 0
Awful service!!! A friend and I went to get mani/pedis. Cost me $116.00, 0
My family and I had high hopes for this place as we were looking for a nice "new" little lunch/dinner spot.  I know it is a chain and you should only expect so much, 0
It's 7:30 am. Time for breakfast. Let's see... Hmmm... no eggs of any kind. Do I want a plate of sausage gravy or some turkey sausage? Maybe a banana that was ripe about 2 weeks ago. Maybe I can have both the gravy AND the turkey sausage...  After 10 minutes of this and watching Magdelina make sure that there were PLENTY of froot loops to go along with the over ripe bananas, 0
Not much here... outrageous prices for creepy and weird used stuff., 0
This review is primarily focused on the service. Came to this location last Sunday for brunch. It was very busy considering that it was around 1:30 pm. This is the only hash house that is located in a single standing building. The others are within hotels/casinos.  The wait took about 40 minutes for a table for 4. Our waitress, 0
Two stars just because the chips and salsa are good. But everything else was horrific. It tasted like frozen crap, 0
They should just shut this location down. I can not get a drink to come out of that store correctly to save my life. I am not exaggerating, 0
It's almost comical. Tried Thrive again. Got the Strawberry Passion. In the menu description it says that it's topped with granola, 0

Hotel needs to be updated. Upon arrival to our room we opened the door and the smell of weed smacked us in the face. The safe had an old pair of old stinky loafers. The water pressure in the shower was terrible and it took forever to rinse out my hair. The room was not very clean. Trying to park close to the tower you were in was a cluster. Rooms were cheap, 0
My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to get some takeout food and coffee to eat by the pool during our weekend in scottsdale and we were referred to Bacon. This turned out to be an unfortunate experience.  Ok, 0

Shame that it now seems that you will have to insist on defining good service for some of the agents here. The host we ordered from did not know enough to let us know that there is a price difference on the boneless wings versus the bone in wings . As a result she miss quoted our total bill. She did want to get paid before our order came out and I think that was because she realized that we did not get what we ordered! We spoke with Randon who was the manager and who easily rectified the scenario but despite his efforts, 0
I've been here a million times. Usually I just go for lunch w one friend. This time I went with my family to celebrate my mom & sisters birthday. We were a party of 12. 3 of us were there first & asked for a table for 12. They told us they would not prepare a table until everyone was there. Once we were all there they took us to 2 separate tables for 6. That defeats a purpose of a family dinner doesn't it? I said "We don't want to sit separate." She seemed very bothered & said she would try to find a table for 12. I felt like it was very irresponsible that they would be so unprepared even after we warned them about our party of 12. Eventually we did get a table & the food was great., 0

Room = 5 Stars   Service = 2 Stars        The service here is hit or miss.  I don't expect a mega resort to deliver       consistently spectacular service but this place has some unhappy        employees.  I experience much better, 0
Utterly disappointed by the entire experience! Beware.   We had a party of 7, 0

I am a licensed Cosmetologist and I came here tonight to buy a blow dryer. This was a bad decision! I bought the Ceramix Xtreme Babyliss Pro blow dryer. I just got home and I opened the box to check out my cool new blow dryer and it's definitely not new! It's all scratched up with I don't know what all over it and there's paint missing on the blue button. Whatever the yucky stuff is, 0

Horrible! Possibly the worst Americanized fake Mexican I have ever had and way over priced. If you are in Vegas and want Mexican, 0
Have been there twice in the past few months.  First time was during the busier snow bird season.  My wife and I were seated quickly.  Order was taken and then they forgot about us.  Tables next to us got their food quickly but ours never came.  Spoke to the manager who offered to quickly make our entrees but we left since we had somewhere to go.  Tried it again about 3 weeks ago.   It was not busy but the service was again terrible.  We wanted to order drinks but could not get the attention of our server who was standing at the ending of the room talking to the other servers.  We finally had to ask one of the busboys.  Our food came relatively quickly.  My wife ordered a hamburger.  It was so greasy that the bun was saturated with grease and not edible.  We complained to the manager who offered to bring her another.  We decided to leave after finishing the appetizers. Would not go back.  It is unfortunate since we live  min away and would love to have a good neighborhood place., 0
Really tasty and affordable diner food. I do prefer this to most chain diners.  It's not the ABSOLUTE best but they have a nice variety.  I've had the Cajun prime rib once and the fried chicken dinner once.  The prime rib is pretty thin. I wouldn't get it again but the seasoning was good. Their mashed potatoes are really good.  The fried chicken was really good when I got it. It has a nice crust, 0

Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks.  Ordered online and got a message back that pizza would be ready i. 15 minutes. This was at 6:15.  Was running late and got there at 6:40.  Thats when i first encountered Moron Girl (MG).  ME:  i'm here to pick up a to go order. MG: Uhhhhhhh, 0
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - STEER CLEAR. We had our water heater go out and our home warranty program assigned them to our case. From the moment Pedro showed up to perform the service they began running up the cost. Very shady in their dealings.  He then said he was going to go get the heater while the insurance worked put the amount. Cindy, 0

Dunno why it is called "fine dine".... There is nothing fine about dining there. I thought it would be an upscale place by its name. But it is not and there are other Indian restaurants in this area which server better food., 0
so is it me or does the place only attract the last rung of the food chain.......there is always like some reject that couldn't get into walmart there. or some other poor soul that most likely does not own a mirror cause they would not of left the house if they did looking that way.  i only went there cause i was told by someone that the place had cheap clothes....well they failed to mention the socially inept cashiers, 0
Really Charlotte?  This your version of Mexican food?  This place besides being in the heart of Charlotte isn't that great.  The food is a cut below a fast food Mexican joint.  The outside part is nice and there are some good things like the sangria drinks but that is about all folks.  If you are there to chill outside for drinks and maybe some apps this is a three star., 0
Tao Beach wasn't for me.  Perhaps I wasn't drunk enough or I'm just in a different place in my life but it was straight mayhem.  Some could vouch that in another life I would of thought this place was hook up heaven between the drinking and the good looking people.  But I've hung up my party hat and all I can see was the Jersey Shore Cast times infinity in every nationality!  I know it sounds like I may be a hater as well but I just couldn't get on that train.  The idea of getting in a tiny ass pool that was past capacity of bodies just was gross.  The music at some points were so intense that I felt like I was on Red Bull.  Definitely not for me!, 0
Waited all night for the song that never came. 4 piano players came and left and my song wasn't played. If it wasn't for the bartender I would've left earlier, 0
it was okay.. nothing more.  the place is really cramped with tiny plastic chairs (like in a classroom) and small tables to match.  this didn't bother me much because i'm tiny too.  the tables weren't sticky either, 0

Quick service. Everything else is very poor. Customer service poor. Adding on unnecessary charges not approved by me.

My fianc\u00e9e and I used to come here a lot and the food was good.  Must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered. 5 small strips of steak for fajitas is SAD.  Maybe I ordered from the seniors menu.  Oh well it looks like I will be stopping by taco bell to fill up. My opinion save yourself the trouble and eat at Taco Bell, 0
This place definitely does not do food like kittens do cute..    So we got the Luis(?) basically a shaved meat sandwich with mac and cheese subbed for fries and the trio of chips and dip.  The chips were salted VERY inconsistently - some chips didn't have any salt and some would burn your tongue it's so salty.  They are also very stingy with the sauces - they only fill the cups about halfway with the salsa, 0
1 star for the exceptional service & extra slow food preperation.  2 stars for the extra greasy pizza  I purchased a groupon for this place and finally got around to using it. I wasn't in a hurry to use it even tho it had an expiration date because I called, 0

One thing I'm a stickler for is definitely Brazillian food. I know my Brazillian from having an ex and bf who introduced me to it. I can cook it most definitely. I was at Sushi Samba for a party and they had passed apps which were great. Great sushi, 0
Not worth the hassle...I bought tickets for my husband and I. We got there and noticed that the room is LOADED with tables and chairs in a long school cafeteria style format. The tables were so close together that it was nearly impossible to squeeze between them. I watched many people struggling to get to their seats. Each table is about 18 inches wide. You are sat across from your guest. Our seats ended up being in the middle of one of these long rows...what a joke (punn intended). After about 10 minutes of feeling like I wouldn't be able to escape if an emergency arose, 0
Terrible service and the food wasn't anything special. Our waiter was working as hard as he could but the other 5 people working seemed to just be sitting around. We were 1 of 4 tables and I heard 2 other tables ask for the manager to complain.   Bottom line is that this place offers nothing special and you shouldn't waste your time., 0

Another instance where I wish I could give negative stars...   Honestly our experience was so disconcerting I don't even remember how the food TASTED!!!  Brief account of hands down the most expensive bad service I've ever received in a restaurant:  Switch Restaurant  Arrived at concierge at Wynn approximately 8:30  Attendant recommended switch over craft  They did not have available reservations at the moment unless we wanted to sit outside.  We wanted to sit indoors so we opted for a 9:30 reservation instead.  We arrived at switch at 9:10.  I asked the hostess if it was possible for us to be seated earlier than our 9:30 reservations.  She said to go ahead and be seated at the bar and they would get the table ready for us and get us shortly.  We waited at the bar until 9:30 and then decided to check on our reservations again.  We let a new hostess know that we were waiting on our 9:30 reservations.   She said they would prepare the table right now and seat us shortly.  After standing there for another ten minutes I approached the podium again to ask for status on our table.  She said they were getting it ready right now.  She helped more guests then she went looking around the restaurant.  She came back and asked us to follow her.  She proceeded to lead us outside.  I explained to her that if we wanted to eat outside we would have been there an hour and a half ago.  She sat us at a 6 person round table immediately and asked if it would be alright.  Although the table was too large for any group conversation, 0

well well well... where to start....   I could start bashing them because the meat in my shwarma was cold.. or I could start bashing them because their chicken tasted more like taco meat or because their " pita bread" was the size of my hand and reminded me more of a shingle than of anything one would usually eat... but I think I'll start bashing them because two outta three of our shwarmas were wrapped with tortillas and looked like burritos.. cold burritos... I didn't realize that Mexico was part of the Mediterranean.. I gave it to stars instead of one because one person in our group, 0

I had reserved at Bentlye's 3 weeks ago for dinner on October 20th and even said that the reservation was for a birthday..... My first choice was BLT and when I tried to reserve there they right away informed me they had a private event and cannot guarantee us seats Bentlye's said nothing when I reserved. I show up for dinner and i see that they have a private event...they take us to sit in a stodgy room on the right of the reception . They were asking us to sit by the wall in a booth instead if by the windows. I said i would wait for a window seat and was told there was no chance of that due to the private party which had taken over their main dining area. This was very upsetting....considering the reservtions were made weeks in advance with a cell phone number on file and for a birthday...but we were never informed about a private event...needless to say we left and went to Aria for an amazing evening...ver very disspaointed with Bentley's, 0

Pizza was soggy and had a very thick crust (this was not a deep dish or Sicilian). Prices were higher then those shown on the online menu.

My fiance and I were attracted to this location because the price was not too bad for a buffet. This is about the only reason I am giving it 2 stars.

Without a doubt the worst commercial airline I have been on in years. The service and attitude of the employees sucks.  They allow everyone to bring on more carry on luggage than is permitted.

Who care if your cameras are broken it stolen, 0

4th of july 2014 ...me and gf stayed here for 1 night in a private room  First impression --Damn this place is like a frat house dudes pumping a keg being loud around the pool blasting music beer cups laying everywhere ..1 drunk dude tried to sell me some bar hop tour..There was a crossdresser hanging outside the entrance drinking  The room was tiny with no tv. Just a bed and bathroom. The curtains were see through had to cover the windows with the blanket for privacy. Wifi didnt work in the room..Worst part was definetly the bed though It was Rock hard my back was killing me the next day..   The good ..walking distance to fremont..informative receptionist at check in..secure parking.. $40 a night for a holiday..quiet after 10pm..  All in all if youre a young frat dude in teens or 20s this might be a good cheap place to stay all others i wouldnt recommend, 0

I was visited Dake on a Friday evening at 5:30 for teppanyaki.  It was not the great experience I was hoping for.  Positives: The restaurant is trendy and nicely decorated.  They really did a great job overhauling the old Zeke's Feed and Fuel.  Service was friendly.  The table side cooking was interesting and entertaining.  Negatives: Our teppanyaki grill just had one other couple when we arrived but they squished us in beside them instead of spreading us out a bit.  I felt crowded during the meal and it was awkward having a private conversation with my husband during our meal.  The chef first cooked the vegetables.  When they were ready, 0

I expected a las vegas airport that routinely delays flights for hours to be awake later than 9pm.  Prices are the highest I have ever seen in an airport for food and drink.  6 inch subway is over $7 slice of something calling itself pizza was ~6 Price for a Bloody Mary was quoted at $11  Interesting place, 0
The food was good but the service was TERRIBLE.  I waited 27 minutes in the drive thru to get my meal.  I ordered the se\u00f1or combo without any special requests.  That's it.  The cashier never mentioned an apology for the wait.  I will not go back, 0
I'm done with Morgan's.  Sure they have a good selection of shoes but I hate to feel like wanting to be treated respectfully is an imposition.

Our past two experiences at this place were less then disirable. We had stop for lunch many times and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salade sandwhich. They brought her a chicken breast sandwhich. she told the waitress about the mistake and the waitress took the plate back saying should would correct it. She brought the chicken saladwich back out and you could tell it was the same chicken breast cut up with some mayo thrown at it. We stopped in again sunday 10/13 night looking for a steak and a place to sit outside after moving all day. I ordered a ber and everyone else soft drinks. the waitress was already on the soft drink refills so i asked where my beer was. She said she would get it right away. after a ten minute wait i went to the bar to get it myself. The bar tender asked if i was ready for another so i told her i was still waiting for my first. She finaly brought me a beer. We ordered calimari and spincih chesse dip. the calimari was like rubber and she only brought 6 slices of small toast like sustance for 4 folks. Two of us ordered the ribeye and two order hamburgers. It took forever for the meal to get to the table. Amazing since there was only 4 other people in the place. We had to ask for silverware when she brought our meals. After ten minutes we had to ask for the silverware again. By the time we hade something to eat with the food was cold. I cut into the steak which i ordered rare to meduim rare it was well done.Convicted criminals see more meat in a meal then what was on that plate! One of the hamburgers has pepperjack cheese instead of american. I told them i would keep the incorrect hamburger for my luch tommorrow if they would bring a hamburger with the correct chees. The waitress agreed. She brought us the replacement hamburger and again it had the incorrect cheese. We asked them not to charge us for one of the hamburgers. The bartender got all snooty wanting to know what type of cheese was on the first hamburger. like it mattered ???The sides with the steak was a very small potatoe and about three to four strands of asparagus. I elected to have sweet potatoe fries to much of my surprise was a 1.99 extra when we got the bill. The sevice was terrible and so was the food.We will never return to this place and we live in Wickenburg. I thing we will drive to Phoenix before i eat there again., 0
Barely mediocre. I'm giving it two stars because it didn't come back up., 0
DON'T COME HERE  I didn't know they had buffets this bad. This was included on the 24hr buffet deal Vegas offers.  It looks promising from the outside, 0

I went to this dump on Friday 02/08/2014. Actually it was the morning of Saturday 02/09/2014 at 1:00am. I wanted to just walk through and have a few drinks and see if there was any attractive women at the bar. I was met at the door by what appeared to be some sort of bouncer. He was the most unfriendly bouncer I have ever met at a door. He asked for my ID, 0
The sushi is good.  It is fresh.  The sushi chef's seemed unprofessional and quite novice.  The fish is tasty, 0

DISGUSTING!!  What a nasty McDonalds! The bathrooms were filthy with no toilet paper. Waited a ridiculously long time for a Jalapeno Double burger which was so gross I threw the majority of it in the trash. It was cold and the slice of processed cheese they slopped on there was not even close to melted. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!, 0

Everything here is good and fresh!  That can sometimes go a long way for people but for me... I was a little disappointed in the bang for my buck.  Personally, 0
I've tried several of their dishes. It's ok.  I did like their cocktail de camaron but nothing special., 0
Eh. Same complaints as most.   While sometimes nothing hits the spot like a simple dog with a plain ol white bread bun, 0
Watch out this place will nickel & dime you. Thought we would give this place a second shot and we totally regretted it. My son ordered the ham & cheese roll up and he asked if he could have turkey instead. They said yes for a $1 extra! Seriously.  Best marketing is word of mouth...remember that., 0

When I went the lady in the ticket booth couldn't explain anything about what to expect once I paid for my visit. So I ended up buying the ticket and then getting a refund. There are dolphins they just swim around and you can't get really close enough to see them because there are people in the way. There was only one lion and he was so far away and there was three tigers two of them were sleep the whole time. The panther and some other animals weren't even out.   All the animals looked drugged up and kept walking the same pattern back and forth. Wasn't very natural. Don't waste your money., 0

The food here isn't bad but it isn't anything to write home about and the servings are small and prices large. I spent $7.50 for a small lukewarm portebella sandwich and my husband got a very small and flavorless omelet with lukewarm bread that was supposed to be toast for $5.50. There are definitely better deals to be had in town. Their bread and pastries are better than their meals but still overpriced., 0
I read somewhere that this was the best bar in Las Vegas and when I went to finally try it I don't see how that could be.  It was a Friday night at around 11:30 or 12 am and we were met at the entrance with someone with their hand up saying that they were closed. A bar in Vegas closed at 12 am in Vegas??  There were like 20 people in the bar. Long story short I will never go there again., 0
I was excited to try this place out because it had fuku burger. I have always been a fan of the food truck but found it too taxing to try to figure out where the truck was parked, 0
Glowing reviews made me try this place and I'm convinced that the people that wrote them are some how affiliated with the owner. Yelp reviews have been very helpful in the past but these ones are a true conundrum. This place is NOT good. I LOVE chicken strips and this place had some of the worst ones I have ever had. My girlfriend and I both agreed we have ZERO desire to return.  The service was friendly and the place was clean but the chicken itself was terrible. To try and explain... have you ever bought chicken from the grocery store that was tough for some reason? It was if they had bad chicken and then they threw it in a fryer with no batter or seasoning on it. They had a tough exterior with no tasty crispyness to enjoy. Bad bad bad. Try to support small business peeps but when Chick-fil-a is waaaay better and it's cheaper, 0
I had heard of this place from Man vs Food and was intrigued by the food. I have eaten here three times and each time I have left crestfallen. I probably built it up too much in my head, 0
We decided to try this place because of the amount of good stars and reviews......BIG MISTAKE! When we arrived, 0
So pumped to go here and then BAM...the worst ever. So sad. The night started off so good. 5 chicks walk up and 5 chicks get escorted to the VIP tables. Pretty freak'n awesome right? (Yes, 0
The food wasn't bad and the service was great. My problem lies with the owner who seated us and the way he spoke to the waitress cleaning the table so we could sit down. I don't know if she wasn't moving fast enough for him or what but he barked at her and she said "almost done" and then he commenced to chewing her out and said "keep your mouth shut and clean the table". I almost turned around and left but we wanted breakfast.  This is no way to speak to your employees and I was waiting for John Quinones to come out and ask "what would you do?"., 0
Everything about this restaurant is wrong.  I checked in a hotel near this restaurant and ordered some food for delivery. It took me 3 calls to place the order. Food arrived after good 2 hours. French fries are soggy, 0
Went here with a large group for a birthday party.  Service was excellent...until it wasn't.  Had to go ask for after dinner coffee, 0
horrible experience ! This restaurant makes us feel like they are dishonest. One waitress appears very very sneaky.  This was our third visit and our waitress was very rude. she talked to us with disrespect and treated us like crap, 0
When the Lindstrom's owned it... it was all about attention to detail. This is my third and last attempt to use this car wash. I'm going to a wedding... need my car nice, 0
I totally agree with Chad. Almost all the so-called authentic restaurants are Americanized to cater most people's taste bugs here.  I went to Italy & saw their Italian cooking.  I tried to go there last night (Satursday evening) as invited by my neighbor who has never been there. I told him its nice to go at least once to experience instead of just listening. Beside, 0
Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the "orange chicken" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting., 0
I came with high expectations to this place of of a recommendation and was really not impressed. I came in after the dinner rush to place a take out order. The staff was pretty friendly but they didn't seem all that excited to be at their job. As for the location, 0
i visit my parents in Nevada once in a while and I also visit the strip with friends. My dad said he would like to take me to a nice place to get a burger. I wasn't about to argue with that. We put our names down and they have a system that sends a text when they are ready to seat you. Really nice! So about 20-30 mins later I get the text and I'm raring to go. We get seated and our server seems like a nice chap. I order a beer, 0
Stayed in Encore and played on Aug 16 with friend.  Course's fairway is in extremely bad shape, 0
So How did I find this place? Well my girlfriend and I wanted chinese food around 10pm, 0
Great beer selection with mediocre food!  The service is painfully slow.  We have been there 3 times and each time we have waited at least 10 minutes before being acknowledged.  They are always understaffed.  The last time we were there, 0

I knew the original owner of Beto's and she would be furious for what is being done to it, 0
The only reason I'm giving this joint 2 stars is the waitress and waiters were very good. The prices are tooooooo high for sub mediocre food. Now I'm not cheap but $9.99 for a 3 stack of average size pancakes and no sides to go with it is ridiculous. $1.99 per egg means I had to fork out another $6 bucks for 3 scrambled eggs to go with the pancakes (now up to $16). Another $1.99 to have a sprinkle of cheese added on top of the eggs ($18 Cha-ching). Add a drink and we'll round it off to $20 for a meal that cost $5 or lower at Denny's. Tab for 4 at breakfast....$74, 0
Just experienced the worst customer service at cafe belle madeline inside Paris Hotel in las vegas. Employee named Daisy has zero customer service training. I never complain but the way she treated me atrocious especially when she mistakenly though I cut into the line... a simple I'm sorry would suffice instead she lectures me and refuses to apologize. So busy telling me to queue in line even when I escalated to yelling (which I never do) she never heard me explain I had been standing in line the whole time, 0
horrible customer service and very unorganized.  Bought 6 sweaters for my kids, 0

It's bar food what could I have expected.  The place was busy and the bartenders where on their game last night.  I didn't have to wait long to get a drink or for them to take my food order so they get points for that.  The food on the other hand was not good.  I ordered chicken wings and they where bland over cooked.  The fries that came with it where undercooked and just not tasty at all.  I only had a bit from each and just left.  The food was only tone star but the service bumps it up to two stars.  With so many places to choose from I think PT's need to be on point every time., 0
I'm updating my review due to the extremely RUDE manager on duty on Easter!   I placed an order for pick up early on Sunday to have picked up at two. I ordered four meals and several pastries from the case. When I was checking out I mentioned that I was to get a side and bagel option with the Benedict I ordered, 0
i have no idea why this place has good reviews!  my salad was ok but the dressing was pure oil!!  the gyro meat was dry and had little flavor!  try yassous greek grill on buffalo and charleston or sultans grill on village center off town center and summerlin pky!, 0

Sucks so bad. The venue is small and uninspiring. Do not pay a cover for this place lest you want to regret it.   We got duped into coming here from those promoters walking the casino (mind you I was traveling with tourists). They gave us free drink vouchers that only worked for wells drinks. Siiiiiiigh.   What a waste of time!, 0

We had Nieto service for aprox 9 months. They would have an army come out to service the house every 2 weeks. All they would really do was blow and mow grass. Left most of the trees untrimmed and we had to ask to get the trees that were way over grown to get cut back. Plus we had tons of weeds that we had to ask to get taken care of. But the main problem is they would prop the gate open and never close it. We asked many times to make sure to close it so our dog wouldn't get out. Well the last straw was after coming home from being gone all day was seeing our dog running down the side walk to greet us when we got home.  There was a sign on the gate and the gate would auto close. But they would prop it open with a rock and leave. So we cancelled the service. I wouldn't recommend because they are too careless. We are extremely lucky nothing happened to our dog!, 0
No parking. They have a parking lot but reserve the spaces for hotel guests only. What hotel guests?  Security is guarding an empty lot. Not cool., 0
Sorry to say this place is disgusting.  I had the caprese salad, 0

I am incredibly surprised that this business has such high reviews. I was treated so rudely that I will never come back. I don't care if I have to pay a higher exchange rate.   I arrived around 8:15 & waited for them to open. I waited until 8:30 to walk in & politely asked the woman behind the counter if they were open. I didn't want to rush them if they weren't ready for customers yet. She rolled her eyes at me & nodded that they were indeed open. I told her what I needed & she gave a big exasperated sigh to show me how much of an inconvenience it was to help me. I guess if you need a currency other than Pounds or Euros, 0
We literally stood in the entrance for 15min and the hostess never showed up as people kept piling in. And the security staff standing there gave no explanation as to why NO ONE was present to seat people. Just stood there. So we left. I can see why it has such low ratings..., 0
Love the stars!  But you can get them online cheaper.  The other lighting that they carry is WAY overpriced and quite antiquated., 0

Recently visited this shop to have a battery replaced in my watch. (Old Tag Heuer)  In the past this was  $10-$20. I was very surprised that they quoted me $79. They mentioned that this would include new seals, 0
This place is horrible..... i paid for a $9 margarita that was literally salt water. The beer was room temperature. My friend and I went in for happy hour and we asked the waitress what their happy hour menu was and she told us she didn't know and told us she would get back with us on their specials and never did. Finally found the menu hidden under the old nintendo64 console and we ordered the bacon wrapped hotdog, 0
Not a great place for large groups. Went with my brother and his family, 0

First time at BabyStacks was ok. Nothing to write home about. I think I would like to try it again just to see. The plain pancakes were solid. The corned beef hash was bland and the potatoes were underdone. My boyfriend had the orange creme pancakes and said they were ok, 0

There was a hair baked into my pizza. My crazy bread had literally no seasoning. Very disappointing. Went back to explain, 0
Over priced with a menu smaller than my chances at finally hitting a 12 on the Field line.   Group of four entered Saturday night hoping for drinks, 0
Can't say I'm too crazy about this place anymore. Haven't been here for a while and it seems the place has gone downhill. Grabbed a bunch of crab legs and most of them were empty inside and rubbery. They lack flavor and were small and watered down. I picked out a few of my favorite dishes but I really did come there for the crab legs. Was very disappointed in the price which has also gone up since I've been there. Will not be returning., 0
I think in my opinion it is a bit waste of money. I ordered chicken wings, 0

This is probably the third time I have tried this same restaurant over the course of 3 years and it still hasn't gotten any better. The chophouse burger was forgettable. The mushrooms and onion strings were a welcome accompaniment but still doesn't resurrect the overcooked tasteless beef patty.  My friend had a burger with pepper jack cheese and commented he didn't even know that it was pepper jack since the flavor was so bland. It seems to me that if you're going to overpay for burgers, 0

I unfortunately got the new guy and it was not a good experience. I have four cuts and he filed my nails down as far as they could go which was not requested. He was very rough and you could tell he was new. The girl who was doing my friends nails had to correct his work and finish my nails. I won't be back because if him...., 0

BEWARE!  I went there Friday afternoon for a business meeting. Beers were $6 and we got the chicken skewers. It was a tiny breast piece of chicken wrapped around the stick then totally dried out. So gross. The sauce was disgusting. We got the "JoJo" fries. Mediocre, 0
My issue IS NOT that you have a cultural event at the library, 0
I am a bit confused by so many four and five star reviews on this buffet?! Have these people never been to a buffet before? Are they just mesmerized because they are at the Wynn and it looks pretty? Possibly they are just blindsided by the price they just paid? Whatever the case may be, 0

Me: Hey can you help me with a piercing I got here a month ago? It seems to be irritated. Maybe the ring needs to be changed. Piercer: You should stop picking it.. Me: I'm not picking it Piercer: Just keep using the salt soaks Me: I have been for a month and it's not working. Piercer: Just keep doing it and come back once it's not so irritated.  I will be the bad guy here and say that in my TEN years of piercings I have never had an experience like this. My friend and I went for the Valentines Day special which was two for one piercings. Everything went well, 0
We also tried it and did not like it. We were seated right away and given our drinks. I asked about happy hour specials and was told they only had drink specials, 0
I've never written a yelp review before but this service really got under my skin. I asked for a bagel with cream cheese, 0
It depends on what you're looking for.  I think the food was marginal.  Most people seem to come for the country music and girls dressed in cowgirl hats, 0
I am writing this based on their running gear since this is why I usually shop here. I keep trying and I'm constantly disappointed. I rarely find what I'm looking for. I think they have more "work-out" clothes and not real "running" clothes such as compression gear and multiple styles to suit every runner. If I'm looking for capris they only have shorts. If I'm looking for running skirts-forget it they don't carry them. I have also been disappointed in their selection of running sports bras and they tend to run out of sizes fast as well. If you are looking for running gear, 0
This was my first time there as my friend bought me dinner for my birthday.  He knows I love good Mexican food.  I must admit at the beginning I really love the food. The service was just OK perhaps we were late. I really planned to give good tips as I asked how late the waitress would work caused we'd stay after dinner to dance. One thing that I felt like being scammed as there was a 15% tips on the bill without prior notice.  I do know many restaurants will pre-add 20-25% service charge for party of 5 & above (with signs) but not 2. There are many restaurants selling liquors that is the highest profits business but don't fool customers who are drinking.  I was still sober as I need to drive.  If they have fine print for that sur-charge, 0
Service was incredibly slow. It seemed like they had maybe 3 people working, 0
In how many different ways can you arrange the same ten ingredients?  If this were a contest, 0
Some of the bartenders make up rules for coupons and whatnot on the fly. My boyfriend just ordered an old fashioned and said it was sweet..it's whiskey. I got a fuzzy navel and it just tasted like watered down juice. Ugh., 0
Wanted to try this place for awhile I should have waited longer. Ordered a sangria which was horrid.  We then had to wait over 45 minutes for our meals. My wife and I both had the 1/4 chicken dark meat, 0

My wife originally wanted to go to the steak house at the Paris but once we realized it was going to be About $400 for lunch we opted for the Pub. First impressions nice atmosphere clean bright vibrant. We sat down with our daughter and waited about 20 minutes for a server to come. I was hungry and went straight away for the toad in the hole and the diver scallops I told the waiter I had not had toad in the hole in over 20 yrs. he explained it was not traditional at which I realized it was basically a pig in a blanket. I changed my order to scotch egg and chicken curry my wife had fish and chips. When the waiter eventually came with the food all at the same time I think a quail egg was used for the scotch egg I got scallops instead of the curry. My wife's food was okay at best for $16 F&E but they cost $30. Scallops overlooked. $180 for two and a half peeps with two drinks each. A lot of dosh for bad nosh, 0
The worst service I ever saw !! Especially if you are not from USA. They just using the high rating on Yelp and do nothing to keep it. I recommend to go to Cabo Wabo instead., 0
Do not waste your hard earned dollars here. For a Saturday night the place was almost empty.   Appetizers (onion rings and fried zucchini)  came out cold.  The wings were very good. My wife's chicken dinner was COLD, 0
Went for breakfast after combing reviews...I contemplated 3 stars but I can't do it. The madame croque was very good (unfortunately I didn't order it), 0
Yay: The wedge with blue cheese is a-maze. Insanely yummy. Servers are friendly.  Dealbreaker: steak is perfect one night, 0
I've been there several times and the young woman who gave me a pedicure was really good. However the last time I went, 0
Neat place, 0
Too each it's own. I saw some nice reviews on Yelp and decided to try.  When I walked in and the phone was ringing off the hook with take out order so I figured the food must be spectacular. I ordered lemon chicken combo and my hubby had orange chicken.  The lemon saw was amazing, 0
Great outdoor place. But we got food poisoned from the saussages. I dont recommend eating them at all. We might come back for a beer, 0
I keep trying to give this location a chance but each time I'm dissapointed. This place tries to save money and I'm doing that the customer ends up getting a raw deal. The meat is old, 0
Another bad place..but it was more likely my bad choice. The veggie delight was a very undelightful mix of mozzarella, 0
Bad experience.  Food was cold.  Filet was tough and not seasoned.   Used to be a good place to eat, 0
Dont buy into the hype. The service at this place is terrible. Waiters barely even talk to you. like "hey, 0

I was looking for a new place to get my nails done and when I called for information the gal that answered the phone kept interrupting me and had NO idea what she was talking about.

Had to write an update based on the service we recently had because it was just too insane.  Walked in for breakfast this last Saturday morning and it took a good five minutes for the server to greet us because she was ringing up another couple - which is totally fine.  However when she did look up, 0
I give this place two starts because it is very pretty. The restaurant is picture perfect and why shouldn't it be? It is after all in the Montelucia Resort. The food on the other hand was pretty bad. It was bad compared to other hotels and to other restaurants. I was here for breakfast so I am not sure what dinner or lunch is like. I ordered the mushroom and cheese omelet that came with potatoes. My bf ordered the spinach frittata that came with fruit. Neither of our dishes were tasty. Both of us couldn't finish it. This is the key piece of information here. I always finish my plate. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I was very sad at my situation. There just was no taste to it. Completely bland and not worth $15., 0
RIP OFF!   Small over priced portions... I ordered 'Swallow a Cloud, 0
One star for this place is a joke. NEVER go to this golf course! ZERO STARS!! Absolutely the worst course in the east valley (or that I've been to). Do not pay money to these guys and here's why (no particular order):  -The owner hit on my girlfriend right in front of me and made her feel awkward -They have kids running the "pro shop". Very unprofessional when an employee is cursing to another employee with customers around. That happens all day. -Greens barely have any roll...you're putting on dirt...There is no true roll at this place. -Fairways? What fairways? It is also, 0
If I could give less stars I would. The worst taquitos I have ever had in my life.  I would have preferred to microwave some boxed ones at home.  Do yourself a favor and go to the Taco Bell right next to that place instead., 0
UPDATED REVIEW: I have to start by saying that my girlfriend and I have eaten here at least twice a month since we moved to the area 5 months ago. And it's usually pretty stellar. Tonight was a major exception.  This was our go-to place to bring friends and family when they visit, 0
After a very immature comment from the "owner" of this establishment. I have decided to drop my rating and never return. If the rest of the staff is anything like the child who wrote the comment on my review I do not want to deal with them. As you can see my previous review was really not negative at all, 0
Minus 5- I was so excited to go here- and then I was like this is definitely the wrong venue for me.   Yes everything is made of ice- which is cool cant knock that. Drinking out of Ice glasses cool- sitting on ice benches yes all good- but UM HELLO I GO TO VEGAS TO BE SEXY, 0
I hate this hotel. I was forced to stay here for a bachelor party. This hotel is ugly, 0
I love myself a hotdog every now and then. Coming from Chicago I heard of this place when I moved here and there great hotdogs.  I am just not a fan, 0
The food was mediocre at best. First day I had steak and carnitas tacos and they both were alright. The carnitas was dried up like it was made a week ago and I didn't even have the stomach to try the steak. The service was good. The next day, 0
I have to add this: on more than one occasion we've seen the cooks handling buns right after touching raw meat without washing hands or changing gloves. NOT SAFE!, 0
Nothing to exciting here. Food was ok. We were driving to Vegas and were in need of food. Stopped by to find the place empty. The waiter was very concerned that our children may spill our drinks or break a plate. Overall I would recommend to keep driving to Vegas to get some Asian., 0
This is the absolute WORST restaurant I have ever been to. The service is the Worst. The staff is very rude. I was there for dinner the day before Thanksgiving with my family and had a very bad experience.   Please avoid and try one of the other Indian restaurants on the strip., 0

My husband and I went here for what we consider a late dinner it was around 7pm. Our experience had made me make a yelp account and write a review I am not a avid yelper but I was just appalled with our service here, 0
Gave this place 2 chances and was disappointed 2 times.    A girlfriend and I had chosen to stay here in may of last year and had an awful experience- rude front desk, 0
I subsisted on rabbit food the week before I was going to dinner at Beckett's Table. I poured over the menu while sitting at my desk at work and drooled at the thought of the bacony extravaganza I was going to consume. I envisioned myself moaning with pleasure over the house made salad dressings...and then...not so much.   I ordered the grilled cheese appetizer and a salad for entree because they appealed to me more than the actual meals. I didn't care for the grilled cheese and the red pepper tomato soup was just o.k. The salad was alright but nothing to get excited about - I like a salad where the dressing wows you or there are a unique flavor and texture combination - that was not the case here. I also ordered the bacon cheddar biscuits - dry. Really dry. My last ditch effort at trying something awesome was the bacon s'more - it was ok. Nothing spectacular.   I will definitely give this restaurant another try but over all it did not impress me.   Atmosphere was really nice, 0
Less than impressed, 0
Came here twice this weekend. Is it worth the $15 cover on Fridays? Not really. I thought it was a bit too much. If you're into seeing old creepy men looking up your skirt, 0
I think that Serrano's has a lot of hype because of it's been here so long and time builds memories of good times. I on the other hand have not had that I go places for good food I have not been impressed with any of the meals I have ate at a many Serrano's locations. I would really say greasy slop along with the chandler location served me a Fat Tire draft with a lime wow come on. So I say save your money and look elsewhere., 0
Aiyaaah. $15 for a burrito...my wallet was sighing.  Came here expecting a pretty easy process to grab a burrito to go. Guess you should go somewhere else for that. My friend and I wanted to escape the overpriced food court next door w/ $8 Subway footlongs and $4 Wendy's chicken. We decided on burritos, 0
This place is just a big warehouse with flamethrowers on the ceiling. Why shoot fire and when the club is called Rain? Why shoot fire when you're hot as hell from dancing and sweating? It just doesn't make sense, 0
The food here was great.  We got the taco platter, 0
You can't getting a passing grade from me if the table you get seated at is dirty.  Dirty table -50.  Ordered a Queso appetizer - the chips were kind of stale. Ordered a french dip & got a philly instead.  One of the ladies at our table ordered a chicken salad with raspberry dressing.  The salad presentation was POOR.  The salad came on a plate? It was missing walnuts (which she later brought out).  The salad was DRENCHED  dressing.  The chicken in the salad was apparently good.  The two racks of ribs we ordered were good.  Don't get me wrong, 0
Got the vegetarian gyoza. Pretty Good. Nice flavor. That's what the 2 stars are for. I also got the vegetarian ramen and it tasted like a glorified $.69 ramen from the grocery store. The broth was bland and had nothing special about it. The noodles were cooked fine but I was just disappointed with the flavor to the soup adorned with only bamboo and mushrooms. It was not worth $9 and I will not be ordering it again. It was also frustrating that although we wanted to eat ramen only, 0

Don't waist your time and money with National Home Warranty. It took 6 trade call visits this year for them to fix my air-conditioning unit after their technician incorrectly wired the unit in January causing the unit to run hot and cold air at the same time through the summer months.

Friendly staff - too bad they put a hole in the dash of my daughters car and tried to tell me it was already there. Shame on you, 0
They do not honor their gift certificates.  They will happily sell them to you but if you try to redeem one they WILL NOT HONOR them when you try to use them.  The will actually try to sell you another gift certificate that is worth less for the same price instead of honoring the original one.  I am not sure how the food is since I never got the chance to try it... but if the way they treat potential customers (by tricking them into buying worthless certificates) is indicative of the food I guess I am not missing much.  Thumbs down 100%., 0
After hearing some reviews on this place I thought I would give it a try. The dinner here as a whole was a failure. The food came out at all different times, 0
I have been to a lot of airports but this place is just a madhouse. This airport is way to small and over crowded and they really need to think about expanding this place. The food options are crappy and mostly just fast food, 0

Once again Park disappoints and screws up before I can even get a drink or food!  This is the 3rd time I've tried this place and the third time I've been treated like hell. This time a large (15) group of us who happen to work just down the street stopped in at 7:30. We were seated by the staff, 0
Not a pleasant experience. As a frequent business traveler, 0
Overpriced and underwhelmed. Didn't blow me away. I came here while looking for "A MUST eat restaurant in Vegas for around $75-100 pp?"  I can't say I was impressed. The server brought out the French fries cooked in duck fat with the different season/sauce pairings which was a refreshing take on a nibbler before your meal. I loved the sauce with the truffle in it.  A bit heavy on the old bay seasoning. Appetizer: ordered the crab spring rolls with sriracha aioli. The shell was crispy and the crab was good, 0
-WARNING!  DO NOT USE!- No stars would be the correct rating!  Horrible!  Slow!  You want damaged furniture call these guys!  You want to save some money on the move DO NOT use this company.  Horrible customer service.  Will never use this company ever again. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 0
I think it's very Phogettable.  Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction.  Where's the crab?  Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, 0

Call me a fool but I have been going to this place for about a year.  I started going there because they had good deals on oil changes and the staff seemed pretty friendly.  Well management has changed twice in a year and it's gone completely down hill.    Every time you go they do an inspection on your vehicle which seemed pretty harmless at first.  In fact it seemed like an added bonus because their the "experts" right, 0

I've been going here for awhile now and I usually get ok service, 0
I've been to The Rose and Crown for drinks before and thought it was a unique place. I went to dinner there last night and was excited to try their food for the first time. By chance I got there during happy hour and was delighted to see they had drink and food specials.  I ordered a glass of wine and the Ploughman's platter - both of which apparently weren't on happy hour -  this fact was unbeknownst to me until my bill came. The Ploughman's Platter was the only appetizer not on happy hour; how convenient that no one told me this until I questioned my bill.  Also, 0
Such a terrible drive through experience. Waited in line for 10-15 minutes between cars. Should have gone inside. Chicken in mushroom chicken was gross and fatty. Barely any beef in beef broccoli and the broccoli was not cooked. I like crunchy veggies but this broccoli was straight up not cooked and greasy. Basically just ate the brown rice with the soy sauce they put in the bag which was good., 0

I wanted to wait to review this because we have only been here a few times.  I have to say this is a hard place to review.  I say this because when we go everyone so nice and friendly.  I say this because they are cutting kids hair all day and I am willing to bet most of the kids freak out in the chair.  So, 0

I used to go there on and off for about  two years due to proximity to my house NOT  because I enjoyed the place. There are two male bartenders that had absolutely no concept of customer service - acted like you should be privileged that they were taking the time off from either watching TV or talking to other friend "customers" to serve you. The clientele wasn't much better - very "clicky" and not the best specimens of society - "trashy". I eventually stopped going in there altogether after I realized the short, 0
WORST STAY IN VEGAS!   I would call myself and experienced Vegas Visitor since I come here about once every month, 0
Here's my problem with this club; they seem to have an incompetent group of teenagers running this place. The girls at will call seem very confused. The staff inside is aloof.   I went there with a group of friends to see Chris Delia. 4 tickets and only 3 of us were there as we were waiting on the 4th to arrive. The girl at the door told us we would have to wait for our 4th person to show up for our entire party to be seated. Then she proceeded to make jokes that were completely lost on us. She giggled and cackled the whole time, 0

I want to go and shower after dealing with these slime balls! The hidden baggage fees these jerks get away with are criminal. We've got 7 people flying....someone else booked the flights. They admitted they had not used Spirit before. They have apologized using Spirit. Spirit's website would not let me check my bags online from their site for some reason (because someone else in our party had checked themselves in which is the normal thing to do!! Spirits website automatically did the whole party as a check in their fore everyone else gets to pay the extra fees...which you dont' know that at the time 'til you call the creeps) Sooo....I had to call Spirit to get my bags checked in and pay upfront (which is supposed to save you $5 per bag). But, 0
Service was really good, 0
Giving 2 stars because they are trying really hard.  I totally wanted to love this place and so did my husband.  We walked up and the wait staff dispersed and came to the door it was weird we felt uncomfortable so we went next door like we werent actually going the Herb n Flavors and we asked them how it was next door.  The girl went on and on about how great they were and that Fox news was there recently they are supposed to be healthy and free of hormones etc. which is what we are all moving towards now a days.  Its nice to have more choices available so we even though we got a weird vibe from that girl almost like she was paid to give good review we thought lets check it.  We asked waitress what was good etc. and ordered based on her recommendations.  My husband had a gyro with artichoke dip on it.  The bread was as hard as a cracker literally sounded like charcoal out of fire breaking.  Broke it off used it as cracker for artichoke dip which was ok and the gyro meat had nice flavor but the fossil like bread was a turn off.  I had the steak tacos which were not good.  Just all around no flavor in spite of having avocado and chipotle sauce.  We tasted sauce separately and nothing no flavor or not enough just bland.  My husband ordered the french press coffee which was $6 omg what a waste of $6 WOW.  its just 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds steeping in water at your table definitely not worth $6.  Not sure why we did this but after reading reviews we thought lets even go further and try dessert.  They said the tiramisu was home made we tried it and again devoid of flavor lacking flavor not worth another $6 and also much smaller than most desserts at $6 not that I am complaining cuz I definitely dont need more but just stating the facts.  I felt bad for these people because they do have a great concept but the location is not a good one and the food is just too much for what you are getting and its really not that good on top of it.  I wanted to love it and our waitress did try so hard and the fouled up food not her fault so we tipped her well and we didnt complain cuz that is so uncomfortable and then they just think you are trying to take advantage and want your money back so instead I prefer to wish them well not come back and YELP it out :-), 0
This place looks really nice inside. I was surprised when the food was mediocre. My husband and I sampled quite a lot too. We heard good things about this place so we were truly disappointed., 0
I sat down at 2p saw server she gave me salsa no chips.

After just about an hour of waiting for our 3 orders of various nachos we walked out...I think the wait was absolutly ridiculous and the waitress and manager agreed with me as well.

I had been ordering about once a week for a few months for lunch and was very happy with the service and food. Prices are reasonable and food quality better than average.   Last week I found a hair in my salad which I understand will happen but of course I did not eat it. I called a week later to place an order and informed them of the hair and was only asking for a replacement salad for the one I had to toss. I was then informed that there was nothing that could be done because I did not call immediately and prove the hair was there.  Its not a free salad issue to me, 0

Went into this place thinking it would be a good experience.  Been waiting for a place like this around this area.  I was so disappointed that I wanted to leave after 5 minutes of being there and not being asked if I wanted anything to eat or drink.  I was sitting at the bar with 3 people behind the bar.  I assumed they were employees only because they were on the other side of the bar.    Went in there with intentions of having some drinks and food.  I only dared to have a couple of beers.  The menu on a clipboard didn't tell me to try the food., 0

Well there goes my money down the drain! I honestly would not recommend this place to anyone! There is a large variety of food but it was all so bland! The crab looked old and it did not taste right! While the shrimp they served was mushy for some reason. The only thing I enjoyed was their noodles otherwise everything else basically sucked! Their sushi was so salty that I had to drink some water to get rid of the taste. 11.99 down the drain!, 0
I didn't eat here so my poor review cannot speak  for the food however it can speak for the service.  I love sitting outside so we sat outside and were basically forgotten about.  All we had was one drink each and we were there for over an hour simply because the waitress NEVER would come outside.  I finally had to go find her inside to give her my credit card.  I don't understand why it was so difficult for them to take my money.    It felt like we were a nuisance to the staff the entire time although we just had a simple beer.   I will not go back again but hopefully my experience is the exception to the rule., 0
We came here for dinner.  The onion soup was excellent but the entree was not as good.   We each ordered a steak and three of us wanted mashed potatoes instead of frites. All of us got frites.  I think it is inexcusable to serve three incorrect entrees. The waiter did bring the mashed potatoes after we complained. I am not sure why they ask how we wanted our steaks cooked as they are so thin you couldn't possible get a rare steak. Price was equivalent to mediocrity as we paid 27.95 for really thin tasteless steaks.  I do have to say that the waiter was polite and efficient and the bernaise sauce was quite good covering up the tasteless steaks but I wont come back., 0

I was really- I don't know- disappointed with Eat. My friend had talked about this place she was so excited to go and our experience was not good.

We sat down and she asked us if we wanted beverages and both of us just said water, 0

Don't expect much.  I regret coming here.  I think what pretty much set the tone for my meal is when our server seemed like she was trying to convince us not to order our food when we were giving her our list of what we wanted.

It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in  months!!!  And lets not forget about the 20" Bobbie I ordered to go!

I went here for breakfast while staying at Planet Hollywood. I was disappointed. I got an omelet and the best part was my toast. There was too much egg and it was overdone and rubbery.

After that, 0
Me and my sister stayed at the luxor and decided to go in and eat. oh em gee was the food horrible!!! Never again will I ever go back.

It doesn't taste like mexican food at all.. never again.. do not go there if I could I would leave no stars but I have to leave one, 0

It's around 1130 on friday night.  You've been wandering around The Linq with a drink (or two) in hand.  You stumble across the Polaroid Fotobar and wonder what exactly it is.  The friendly employee at the door informs you that you can email pictures from your phone and have them printed out RIGHT THERE.  The images are printed out in the style of a retro Polaroid picture.  THIS IS AWESOME  So you sit down at one of the many computers and get to work.   You upload the pictures and send them to print.  What's this? Shipping address?  You want them to print out over at the register, 0
Last visit was Saturday December 17 for dinner. Had a gift card so the family and I did dinner and a movie.  Upon entering the restaurant we were blinded by a lamp aimed directly at the door from the hostess station. Apparently the overhead lights in the lobby were out. As we were lead to our table, 0
This place SUCKS!  So SLOW SERVICE!  They make 1/2 our order than wait on others & make their drinks, 0
I really don't get all the great reviews this place had received...  1) Good luck getting in if you don't have a reservation.  2) Greek salad was good, 0
Had to use the drive thru, 0
Simply put service was horrible food was ok nothing special and finally price was high for quality of service, 0
One 1/2 star for being near where I commute and therefore easy to get to.  One 1/2 star for having a wide variety of items.  One star for pricing, 0

We went back for another visit just a couple of weeks ago, 0
I wouldn't even give them one star if yelp would let me. I took my car here to have it detailed after my car became rather muddy after a hiking trip. When the car was returned there was still a substantial amount of mud on the floor mats and you could still read the writing on my window that they used to identify which package I wanted. My husband mentioned something to the employee who quickly dismissed him and half-a$$ wiped it off. Not happy. They wouldn't even look at the mats when we had pointed it out to them., 0
this pains me to write this review--I have been to Beckett's Table several times and have always enjoyed the food, 0
I have mixed feelings. I love the food but the restaurant is ran by kids. You ask them a question and they look at you like a deer in headlights and unable to provide a solution. In the future if you have a large party please offer a solution for example: employee: I'm sorry and we appreciate you coming in we are very busy. I have a few options are you ok with splitting your party up or we have available outside seating. Only option we were left with was to leave. It's sad business owners don't appreciate the power and importance of customer service., 0
Horrible.  I am a strict vegan.  I ordered a latte with soy milk at the drive trying thru and drove off.  Halfway to work & 6 sips in I realized something tastes off.  I opened the cup to discover whipped cream at the top of my cup.  I am enraged!  Obviously if someone orders soy they are either vegan or lactose intolerant so adding whipped cream defeats the purpose & makes no sense.  I called to complain & the manager offered to make me a new drink (too late, 0
It was terrible, 0
I have been to several Planet Fitness since joining a month ago and this location is the worst by far. The bathroom area is always dirty A light has been out in the showers for over a week. Hydro beds don't work right and staff acts like they don't want to be there  Not a good representation of the chain., 0
I love how this place is close to my house where i can buy high end makeup. I just don't really like the staff they seem very distracted like the cashiers are just standing there chit chatting while all of us are like waiting in the damn line. Also last time I went there, 0
All I can say is the horrible service overrode everything that could possibly have been good about the food.  The ambience of this establishment was very cool and hip and had an abundance of open air seating which was most welcome coming into phoenix from Michigan winter that same day.  However, 0
They took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  They'll make one for you especially but I always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.  Plus, 0
Wow.  Worst dining experience I've had since a little buffet in Louisiana.    Terrible old and dingy decor.  Our seats and tables were basically hosed down. It was all wet from someone "cleaning" it.  The buffet was scary and I thought I may get food poisoning, 0
$6 steak and eggs? Obviously people who get excited about this deal aren't from LA's San Gabriel Valley. The Chinese cafes around here offer $5 steaks and that comes with pasta, 0
really no stars. I just had the most horrible experience which smacks of discrimination. The staff were unprofessional., 0
Unbelievably poor showing from a Jean Georges establishment - the service was indifferent, 0
My family and I have been seeing Dr. Traci Doan for the last 8 yrs and visits have always pleasant until today....she had different staff! I don't mind Ashley telling me procedures and charges BUT the hygienist, 0
Food here is excellent. Service is very sub par. Very unfortunate since I really do enjoy the food here and it is one mile from my house. When my family and I come in it takes 10 minutes to get a menu, 0
I stopped in here to eat while waiting on a tire change at Discount Tire.  I thought this was supposed to be a family restaurant. The waitress (girl) had on shorts so short, 0
Stick to their Brunch that has apparently generated some positive reviews but think twice and avoid their evening dining.  Sadly, 0
Extremely disappointed.  The facilities were ok, 0
The hot dogs are good. The rest of the food is disgusting full of fat. I couldn't even finish my burrito I felt sick. The cashier girls are really rude they need training on good costumer service. They seem angry and depressed. I would NEVER eat there again., 0
They were rude to me. Their food is disgusting. Maybe it was a bad day but, 0

took my car in for an oil change.  everything seemed fine until 2 days later my skid plate underneath my car fell off.  I took it back to gruelich's and they claimed they did not touch the skid plate during the oil change.  they said i must have knocked it loose by hitting a curb (which i did not do).  took my car immediately to the dealership and was told 1 of 2 things happened;  either gruelich's did not replace the skid plate properly after the oil change so it came loose and fell off or gruelich's did not really even do the oil change at all because they are lying when they say they did not have to remove the skid plate to do the oil change.  i haven't taken my car back since and just go to the dealership for oil changes., 0
Very bland., 0
This is a fairly good gym. The showers are boiling in the summer, 0
It's has been a week and no response from management. Absolutely stay away from doing business with them. If anything goes wrong they will not take care of you. There's other chapels out there. Look for a company who cares., 0
This place is the epitome of "dive".  It's not yucky or gross, 0
I purchased a car and in less than a month I had to take it in to get it checked the guy said the car was ok. A month later the car started shaking and turned off. Then I call the salesman and they said they can't help us take in the car because they close at 6:30. So tell me how can I get help in bringing it in to get it serviced not happy with the customer service, 0
My friends and I stopped at the buffet for dinner and instantly regretted it. The pork chops tasted like leather, 0
I'm a sushi fan and heard this was the best place in the city. If that's the case then Montreal sushi is in trouble. The sashimi appetizer was good but nothing to write home about. The Sushi was average and the maki - which I understood to be their specialty - was over-done - dipper and fried and then poached and seared and sauced (I exaggerate but u get the picture). And it was over priced..  Two stars for good service  and nice decor., 0
R.I.P rum jungle techno and reggaeton?  is the play list now ? Whats the change from seven month's ago. Are the trying to get a certain clientele now also they gave us free passes to enter and we left early but was able to get re entry stamp. Another one of my favorite club's is gone or garbage now., 0
Too bad the coffee is so so.  I've been wanting a coffee shop in the hood., 0
I visited this place on 7/27 after finder them on SpaFinder. My Fiance & I had received a couple of Gift Cards for our recent engagement and decided we could use a Massage. I went on SpaFinders website to finder a merchant who accept their SpaFinder Gift Cards and I stumbled across SpaMassage For You. I checked out the Yelp reviews prior to visiting the business and the majority of bad reviews were placed by disgruntled Groupon users. First off, 0

This is by far one of the worst casino reservation booking that I have ever experienced I would give them zero stars if I could I don't understand with there lack of customer service how they are even still in business, 0
Just like some other people have said its just not what it was. Burgers are just so so and ofcourse you can buy an overpriced shirt or glass go figure, 0
Very very disappointed in the fact that they have discontinued several of their salad bar prepared salads. I loved their southwest lentil salad and the mediterranean orzo salad. The lentil salad is gone. And the orzo salad has changed. Not in a good way. SO that's what used to get me there and I would wander around and end up spending $100. SO now no reason pulling me in. They have lost my $$., 0
Quite a few years back, 0

How on earth can you look me in the eye and hand me the crappiest Macchiato ever!?! It's possible if you have no idea what you are doing...  The espresso machine has a frosted glass shroud around it which I didn't even notice until I realized he flipped a switch to start the auto milk steamer. Too late! Already paid for it. This glorified magazine stand is just capitalizing on people wanting something convenient.  When I saw the Lavazza Coffee logo I thought there was at least a chance for decent coffee given there was some effort and minimal skill of the barista. You people should be ashamed of yourselves., 0
The service was not good at all. I ordered a Chicken burger and it came with chicken thigh instead of chicken breast. The people who ate with me were also complaining their food was not good. It seemed pricey for what you got. Definitevely NOT going back there..., 0
Bad attitude of the staff and very misleading people.  I was led to believe that i was paying extra for a room to get a view of the bellagio fountains but was given nothing. According to the front counter I was paying for a view of their swimming pool and eiffel tower. I was then told that I would have to pay another $44 per night for the view I wanted. I agreed to even that and so I walked all the way down with my bad knees and there was a different story.    Edith, 0

Don't waste your time! They won't make room for walkins and are quite rude! Are all these positive reviews fixed or paid for? They were obviously not interested in me or my business. Too bad I will make sure I share this., 0
Not HAPPY! Acrylics were done by one of the male techs, 0
never again...drove the six miles in there only to find out there is no doctor on duty. what a waste of time. Sure I could have called but when I need "urgent Care" (in their name) I would expect someone scheduled. Whats urgent about that? Sounds more like "Not That Important Care" to me. Perhaps a name change would be appropriate?, 0
Can't go wrong with the location and the views but the management office is highly incompetent. They used to be good but the service has almost become non-existent. Also there are a lot of "children" who live here and treat the place like it is their own personal garbage can.  Update 2 years later - this place has officially fallen to complete garbage. I have never seen such incompetence in a staff and the maintenance staff is non-existent.  Seriously I'm not just saying this, 0
I miss donuts so much and must say this place was so disappointing.  I don't want to have political chat when trying to get my donut grub on and don't want to hear crap about how corporate america is taking over and the new giant eagle in robinson has copied....blah blah bla blah bl blah!  Shut up man!  Oh and they are overpriced.  The thing is they are good but can we get a nice donut shop in the strip where we don't have to hear about this stuff on a nice sunny morning.  Come on now.....WTF!?  Please lower the cost and shut the hell up!, 0
I'm really disappointed in this location.  The last two times I've been here they haven't had the kind of meat I wanted ready.  This Thursday night at 9:20 they didn't have any steak for my burrito.  The guy said it would be ready in about eight minutes.  I told him I'd come back another time and walked out.  This Saturday at 11:30 AM I was in and asked the order taker for chicken tacos.  We both looked at the container that should have had chicken and it was empty.  The lady said it would be about 4 minutes until it was ready.  I waited and got my tacos and they were good.  I think I'll give them a while to get their act together here before I come back., 0

I am so disappointed in the experience myself and friend had last night. He was so excited about taking me here because he said the pizza was some of the best he had ever had and he knew how much I like trying new places.   We arrived at around 9pm and it wasn't busy. We were greeted nice enough and asked if we wanted to sit in the main seating area or the bar area. We choose the bar area so that we could also watch highlights of the game. We got a booth, 0
Was pretty pumped to try a new place downtown, 0
$48+ for brunch on a Saturday.  about an hour wait.  they text you a little before your table is ready, 0
I expected much more from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant being that he is so highly critical of others and their methods. I like all of his shows and even started cooking at home after watching an entire season of Kitchen Nightmares on Netflix. That might have nothing to do with his restaurant, 0
Mediocre service was the best part of eating at this sports themed retread. The only reason to come here is if every other restaurant in the area is closed., 0
i am very disappointed with the service. i waited 45 minutes for 3 orders. and take note its "take out". the crew are running around cos there are a lot of people. well every crew has to have there own station. and the receptionist is out of sight. there were still people coming in and waiting to be sitted. but the receptionist is inside the kitchen making orders. management sucks. not organized at all. people are waiting, 0
Called about charges on my account that I did not authorize and after a long conversation with "Mike" where I was repeatedly told that I was wrong and he refused to do any thing but charge me additional fees, 0
The reviews were very good so my wife and I tried this place last night. Granted it was the Friday before Christmas and it was 30 minutes before closing but we could not have been more disappointed. My wife ordered enchiladas and I had a carne asada burrito. Mine came to the table 5 minutes after my wife's and when I bit into it it was cold. I sent it back to the kitchen and 5 minutes later it was re-served cold again. Besides the temperature, 0
If you're into stinky and disgusting bars with crappy music, 0
I go against the grain. I thought it was an amazingly salty place. I had my month worth of dietary sodium all in one sitting. Still don't know why if it is a steak place they don't ask how a customer prefers his meat like rare medium or well done.???, 0
Lady at the front desk is very nice.  The guy that repairs the shoes, 0
Just visited and extremely disappointed. No mixed drinks, 0
I was just told that they do not want my money. I asked for extra services and none of them were completed. Kind of silly that I was willing to pay their prices with no questions asked and they couldn't be bothered to do the work as request.  Also, 0

I came in early enough to drop off my medication at the Walgreens pharmacy they told me it would be 20 minutes to get the refill so I waited I waited I waited and I never heard my name be called so all of a sudden it was 6:05 p.m. The entire pharmacy was closed I went up to the front and I spoke to the supervisor there I forgot her name she has long curly hair she wears glasses for haiair color is blondish brown she's Hispanic and I told her to call back there and get someone because my prescriptions are there she did not want to call back to refuse to help me and then I had to keep asking her to please call back after I need my prescriptions pharmacist came up to the front he was able to give me my prescriptions ring me up and I was on my way so I had to call back the next day and report her to her manager and that was a waste of my time because she should have known that she could have helped me by simply just calling the pharmacist like I had to keep asking her to do I would not suggest the store to anyone, 0

This place is nothing like the Korean BBQ here in Chicago. I was very disappointed which is saying a lot for a person such as myself. I am rarely picky, 0
I have a 2000 528i that was given to me by my mother. She has been taking it here for years. I have taken it back there for oil changes since I have owned the car for the last two year. I guess they are hard up for money now and are willing to make shit up so you have to spend money that you don't need too. I brought it in in the beginning of the year for an oil change. The woman in the front office gave me a list of things that need to be done to my car. She made it sound urgent to get this done. I told her when I get the money I'll bring it in. Well several months later I got some of the repairs done on her list by others. Went back again for an oil change and now never mind the oil leak (they claim I have so bad), 0
Not a good experience. At least I got a refund after the issue., 0
Food are ok but they have the best ube boba tho. I use to work here like 2 years ago and I decided just to order something that doesnt involve them cooking because truthfully they dont wash the dishes correctly, 0
Hey cops...just because I happened to be leaving a bar at 2 am doesn't mean I'm drunk.  I'm a tiny girl and I don't need three cop cars surrounding me and treating me like some second class citizen because it is your duty to protect and serve.  Thanks for throwing my purse on the ground, 0

So I was really excited to be staying at this hotel because I haven't stayed here in sooooo long.  When arriving the bell guys were really nice and took our stuff with no problem. Check in: We got up to the counter and the guy that was checking us in was a true PAIN IN THE ASS! Sorry this was horrible he snapped at us the entire time. He didn't explain anything to us and was trying to charge us extra for everything. We finally had to ask for the manager and by the time she arrived he was already finished and the manager didn't do anything other then let us check in 30 min before 3PM. LOL  Room: RUNNNNNN DOWN they were not good at all it was extremely out dated and not very clean. When you go to Vegas you expect  these nice rooms but what a huge let down.  Pool: LOL compared to the other pools on the strip this was nothing to see or even be at. It is this round pool that everyone just hangs at. BORING  Checking bags on the way out: So my sister was waiting in the line and gave the guy one bag and I walked up with my second bag and the guy said he didn't have room for my luggage. So I had to wait in line AGAIN to check in the bags. BEYOND RUDE AND EMBARRASSING. Checking out: OMG THE rudeness continues we apparently were being charged extra things like early check in and etc. because the guy checking us in was just an ASSHOLE. So we had to ask for a manager AGAIN.  Overall this was a disaster! I would never stay there again. Employees RUDE, 0
This was my first visit at Tilted Kilt. Me and my friend were there for lunch. it was pretty busy for lunch ( i don't know how though).

I've been to this office several times in the last year and  strongly agree with Joan C.'s review.  The hygienist  pushes extra dental work and cleanings.  I got the deep-cleaning 2 months ago and my gums feel worse than before.  I "saw" the dentist once--she peeked in, 0
We ate dinner for Thanksgiving.  THe lights were so dim that we had to use the our phones to read the menu.  Food portions were large.  THe server clained it serving size is for 1-2.  She was absolutely wrong...was enough for 4-5 folks.  Bottom line is that we had ordered a lot of food based on her recommendation.  The server looked like she was high or just a ditz!, 0

Pizza Hut has always been my favorite pizza chain but this particular location continues to disappoint.  Have ordered a variety of items on several different occasions b/c this is the most convenient location for me.  It feels like I literally have to tell them all the things to make sure they don't screw up the order.   The wide variety of mistakes is the most impressive thing about this location.  From putting the wrong sauce on my wing orders, 0

Got a Tix4tonight coupon and went here at 9pm after a show. The food was horrible and the couple next to us agreed. I saw the waiters take a lot of full plates from tables as a lot of it wasn't even edible. The pasta tasted weird and the sushi tasted worse.The only think good was the dessert which was heavenly compared to any of the food.  All in all, 0
Well my Mr turned 40 today and what better way to show my love then to take him out for a nice dinner for 2. Well as you can see by my rating this went horribly wrong very fast.  ***** The space at Fines is modern comfort. Comfortable with long oversized banquets.. ball chain screen and cool stained concrete floors that looked like suede. We were sat off a 7pm reservation immediately. We both noticed that the patio was hopping.. great for a new local business. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine from the host and loved the selection from that menu as well as the food menu.  **** We waited for some time until our glasses of wine were brought to our table. The person delivering was apparently our server. She never asked how we were.. told us her name.. just dropped the wine off and asked if we were ready to order. We placed our order and took in each other. The wine was very good and the space comfortable. Our apps came out in pretty decent time and we dug in. I had the calamari and the Mr had the BLT.. both were pretty good though mine should have had less salt. Otherwise the food paired with our wines quite well.  ***Waiting for our plates to be cleared we felt that maybe we weren't that important. The host guy was fawning over 2 tables with champagne service as well as sports scores for the table next to us. Service is a pretty big deal to me and can pretty much ruin an evening. Finally our plates were cleared and salads brought out some time after that. I had the Arancini and the Mr had the grilled radicchio salad. Both were prepared well and pretty tasty. We also ordered 2 more glasses of wine which came out pretty quickly. Then we were done and we waited once again.. and waited.. and waited.  **Meanwhile the server assistant came and took our plates. I also asked where my new glass of wine was I had ordered at the beginning of the salad course. The assistant went to the bar and grabbed my glass of wine and was intercepted by our server who then snatched it from her hands. She then tossed her hair and brought me the glass. Now we had no silverware.. no water and a glass of wine. Then we waited and waited again.  *Finally after 35 minutes our server told us the kitchen was backed up and that the entrees would be out in 5 minutes. We told her fine if it was only 5 minutes. We waiting this long, 0

I want to like this place and go back since it's near where I live.  The food wasn't too bad.  But the service is horrendous!!!    The wait staff are slow but the bar tender is MUCH worse.  The waitress brought me a beer and a few sips in, 0
I understand why people like this place.  Their portions are huge and the plate presentations are pretty cool.   They almost always have a long wait which takes away from the quality of service.  Plus, 0
Here on business so probably not  important guest. No tv remote in room. Was sleeping at 9:30 pm when maintenance woke me up with loud knock about a service call for shower I supposedly made. I said I didn't call you and sent him away  and checked and sure enough my shower was in parts. Called manager who said the guy would b right back. I shared I was sleeping and he said I could have put do not disturb sign up. I was like ok but then I wouldn't have a shower. 1.5 hours after being awakened I am still being forced to stay awake to wait for repair so I can shower before business meeting in am . I mean who assumes it is ok to not tell a guest there is broken shower in room when u check in and thinks isnok for guest to wait until wee hours of morning to get working shower for hotel room u r paying for. Not a good hotel for biz. I think showers are standard part of room you pay for ans no guest should be woken up and asked to stay up until midnight so they can have shower at 6 am in morning; maintenance showed up at 12:24 a.m (yes it is NOW AM the next day) and is working on it ...........so the mirage asked me to choose cleanliness - getting a shower head - over sleep for my biz trip - NOT OK - clearly not enough staff - again - who puts guest in a room without a shower ?seriously., 0

it was quite the festive atmoshere with the world cup on big screen but the staff were quite snobby bitches. I wanted to smack one of them at one point as they were quite rude to my mom.

Otherwise was just an ok experience. I won't be going back again in the future though, 0

This cleaners has become an over priced poorly managed cleaners. if you are an Ahwatukee person.  Go to Tide cleaners.  Their laundry is 20% cheaper and 100% better! The people at the counter at Legend are fantastic...but the end result is horrible cleaning.  If you want the cheapest place to clean a suit...go to Legend, 0
I drove up from Tempe. Long drive. Burgers were great but I'm not a fan of the Homeless atmosphere standing around trash can fires with expensive drinks. (Cash Only)  Band was decent. Place closes early like 10pm., 0
The food was bland.  The chips came from a bag.  It was far too expensive for the quality of food they serve.  The service was decent though if that counts for anything., 0
I went there thinking / hoping this place had some resemblance of its predecessor; The Fish Market. Boy was I mistaken. First, 0
I'm glad I FINALLY made it to a Sonic.  Now I never have to go again.  It's not that it's terrible.  It's mostly just "meh."  No better and sligtly worse than other fast food joints (much worse than some).  The burger meat was tasteless.  All I tasted was lettuce.  It's one of those burgers that depends on onions and mayonnaise to have any taste at all, 0
The server/ oyster shucker seemed annoyed to be disturbed from his sports game on TV by me ordering or requesting items like napkins, 0
To be quite honest, 0
I want an Owlzilla and I want one now *stomps feet*  Fat bastard wouldn't sell me one and they are the only good thing about this place.  (Except for wings, 0
Wow.....as bad as it gets.... And I've been traveling for 39 years. Terrible terrible terrible, 0
DONT DO BUSINESS WITH RIVERVIEW.   It used to be called Larry Miller Riverview Toyota. Now it's Brent Berge's Riverview Toyota. Without knowing exactly why they changed names, 0
I don't think this doctor even deserves a rating as high as 1. He is a typical pill pusher. I went to him for severe back pain which I have been seeing a chiropractor for for some time. He did not listen to my complaints but just prescribed pain meds which is what I have been trying to avoid. And he has the mist horrible bedside nanner. Worse experience ever!, 0
I always come in here hoping for a better experience than the last, 0
I am not sure if it was a bad day or if they saw me and didn't care about giving me a better quality of food. This place was terrible. I ordered sushi including egg rolls and the egg rolls was the only thing that looked freshly made. The shrimp tempura seemed like it had been sitting around all day. It was tough like rubber. The kani which was two pieces were two separate colors so this was a clear indication that it wasnt fresh at all. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE FOOD!, 0
This is an odd and confounding review to write. This place has got solid five star reviews, 0
Although I have read so many good reviews on this place, 0
Really disappointing!  My girlfriend and I attended the food truck festival at the Southpoint.  I have read and heard so many great reviews.  Could not wait to try this place.  In fact, 0
Room is OK.  Don't like the fact that my favorite beer is not available at this hotel. Clubs a C-list - they are fine to see once and going a 2nd time sucks. The pool looks nice though., 0
The pyramid structure is pretty awesome, 0
This is one of the WORST run organizations that I have ever seen. The DQ here in Las Vegas seems as though the franchisee is MIA!! It's run by a bunch of kids that can care less. When my wife called to speak to the mgr, 0
I'm only giving a 1 star review because I can't give a ZERO! I took a Relic watch in to them which has a pin missing from the band. The owner and the repairman were behind the counter when I entered. The repairman was working on something, 0
I want to add that after leaving this review about my experience. USA went on my company profile and left a bad review when they have never used my company for any of their service. I got a call at my home from someone named Chris telling me that they were going to leave a bad review for my company profile on yelp. Very Bad Experience. Long story short they lied to me. Lady started crying and apologized to me for trying to take me. Told me that business has been really slow and because of me that they will never think about taking someone again. I still don't recommend this company. Please don't go here!!!, 0
I remember going here as a child and thinking that it was one of the greatest places in the world. I appreciate deep fried food, 0
I bought window tinting for my husband several years ago and it was fine so we bought a bed cover from them last year they installed it and it started falling apart we asked them before the year warranty was up and they told us it was our issue to go to the company who sold it to them. We called the company they said no quality bumper is responsible for the install we called QB again they still won't help us so now we have a truck bed cover that is falling apart cant protect our tools etc...this was almost 2000k this company does not back their work, 0
I am writing for this particular location, 0
So when my number was called one item was missing, 0
This store really needs to work on customer service.  I have been there a few times and the employees are just rude., 0
I really didn't like anything we got here. I usually try the General Tso's Chicken and Beef Pepper Steak every time I try a new Chinese spot. The beef was tender but the sauce they had it in was way too salty, 0
These assholes "replaced my number " because they couldn't fix the left clip holding it in . Waited a week for my car only to find the clip had just been fixed and the stole my cell phone charger . No I didn't take it out I never take it out and they still had the balls to charge me for a new bumper, 0
I did not enjoy my experience here.    Service - Very slow.  I was in a larger party but we had to flag the waiter down just to get our initial order taken.  Meals came out at different times which was awkward when you're out to dinner with friends!  Food - I hate to give such a bad review but I'm going to give the truth here (because you CAN handle it ;).  The calamari and crab rangoons were the worst I have ever had.  The calamari had no flavor and looked exactly like Burger King onion rings.  Not to mention that the portion was very tiny.  The rangoons had barely any filling.  As for my main entree, 0
Inconsistent is the best way to describe the Village Tavern. I have frequent business lunches there and the salmon has always been fairly good, 0
SUMMARY: Overpriced, 0
Not worth the hype.  They hand you menus as soon as you put your name in, 0
I certainly don't understand the hype over this place.  That's strike 2 for you Guy Fieri (#1 is Chino Bandido, 0
The location is convenient and the atmosphere is great. The service got to be annoying. I was here with a client for lunch and we were clearly in an important meeting. I had a notebook out writing in it, 0
While it's cool that this spot has a giant drink menu to chose from it seems like they are on the more expensive side. The inside has a cool modern "industry" feel, 0
I don't know about this place.  I wanted it to be good but it's not quite there for me yet.  I had fish that was stuffed with seasoned potatoes.  The fish was undercooked but the seasoned potatoes were good.  It was served with sone Libyan Rice which was seasoned with clove, 0
Do not stay here. This is the worst hotel in Vegas. Dirty rooms. Disgusting bathrooms. And if you stay in the courtyard, 0
Went to McKoy's this past Saturday.  I can't speak to the food, 0
Ate there last week and decided to order for delivery tonight since the food was so good. I ordered the large beef stew, 0
Awful experience every time I come here. I asked for chips & salsa & was ignored. Then upon other customers & myself trying to communicate with the bartender she completely gave me an attitude. Then I asked for no salt on my margarita & she put salt on it. She tried to take her mistakes & blame it on others. When I asked for chips & salsa AGAIN. She said, 0
I did not have a good experience at Marquee. I went on a Monday where drinks were supposedly free for females from 10p-11p. That was a lie, 0
This is probably the worst company I've ever had to deal with. To arrange a pick up of their containers is nearly impossible task for them and requires lots of phone calls and patience on the customer part without any guarantee of success. Save your time and nerves and avoid dealing with this company., 0
Very crowded! Go to the one on Central. Way better IHOP., 0

I'm not a fan. Other than one cocktail waitress the service has been RIDICULOUS.  Most of the food I have had is pretty gross, 0
This lady tried to overcharge me to get a dress altered $110. When she called to tell me the price I asked if she could do any better than that and she said no so I drove all the way to the shop to pick up my dress... When I got there then she wanted to negotiate and offered to do it for $90. I got my dress altered for $85 at seams to be alterations instead.. Nice ladies, 0
Overrated hipster joint. Looks cool but food just doesn't cut it for the price. Medium quality, 0
Imagine my surprise when I went to give these guys one star and they already have a one star rating. they lost yet another package for a top customer of mine, 0
Shame on you Macaroni Grill! I ordered a "Create Your Own Pasta" dish for take out and was horrified when I got home. My $14 pasta (which included chicken for an extra $3.50) consisted of one small chunk of chicken the size of a nickel and approx. 15 noodles. There was virtually no sign of the sauce or veggies I had requested. What a horrible waste of money., 0
Very disappointed customer. We spent the weekend here at harrahs And decided that after walking the strip we would see the show "defending the cave man" which was a very funny show... Anyways, 0
Ug, 0
Both times I have been in this location I have asked simple questions and two different employees have rolled their eyes and made me feel like asking a simple question about merchandise would completely put them out. As a fellow Starbucks employee, 0
We stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we caught our flight.  For hunger purposes it served its need.  I've eating many Asian soups before and this one wasn't anything to brag about.  The shrimp wonton noodle soup was equal to ramen noodle with delicate dumplings. For the price just grab a bagel or something else if you are famished or go in the gift shop or better yet wait until you arrive at the airport., 0
The app was very nice (something breaded and fried), 0
While visiting friends in town, 0
The restaurant is nice and clean; employees were friendly and I really liked the zucchini sticks...   But the prices are very high for fairly small portions of fast food I feel I could make better at home.  If I'm craving zucchini I might go back, 0
DO NOT EVER GO HERE! Man, 0
They can never get the order correct, 0
If you are in Henderson Nevada you will find it easier to hitchhike than wait over an hour for this outfit to send a cab to your house., 0
This place was not good.  Definitely not the place to be scene.  Not a good looking crowd., 0
Yuck! It is overpriced. I ordered the sea bass and butterfish and soft shell crabs. The tempura was bad, 0
Yes its true one should not have extremely high expectations for buffet style restaurants however...this one is just.... blah. Some stuff was kinda good but everything else was just blah...I tried the Mongolian grill and it was kinda gross not much flavor. Out of all the Chinese food buffets I've been to this one definitely ranks towards the bottom. Oh, 0
PRO - close to camelback mountain CONS - Dirty, 0
Should have read reviews before making the mistake of coming here. Rip off!!! Do not come here. With a competitor coupon, 0
they need to shut this place down and open a wendys or something....came thursday night, 0
Went there for dinner had to wait for about 10 mins to come ask us for a drink order. Whom was the manager then the server she took forever coming back never asked if we waited another drink or anything had to ask another person to give us the check. Gave them a few times but the service as gone down so badly will not be back again, 0
Above all this restaurant suffers from a seeming lack of experience.  I can overlook mediocre service if the food is decent to good (unfortunately the food was fair at best).  It took a very long time to get our tea and appetizers.  And when the main dishes finally arrived, 0
Our food was served Luke warm. The sweet and sour chicken was terrible. I ordered Brown rice which was not cooked completely, 0
Worst branch ever!!! Well maybe not the branch but Monique is the worst drive thru teller. Hey, 0
Let me start off by saying that I love shopping at local boutiques and I really wanted to love Lotus. The store is very bright, 0
Buffet line wayyyy too long to even thing about getting into.  (seniors eat for five dollars monday nights)  So we walked to the next restaurant over which was Mi Casa.  The food is worse than chilli's, 0
This restaurant is very hit and miss.  We bring our staff here (usually 9-11 people) for lunch.  Sometimes the food is good, 0
I hated this place from the moment I stepped onto the patio and had my first encounter with the rude security people.  There wasn't enough seating maybe just two small tables outside on patio.  When you enter the building its tiny inside with very little seating as well and too much space is used up for walking space.  The layout is just poorly done.  Walked up to the bar to order a drink and waited patiently for quite sometime before the bar tender came over and helped a rude drunk that pushed his way up right next to me well almost on top of me.  I literally had to push the drink guy off of me and tell him to chill out.  I pushed him off of me several times.  The bar tender was beyond rude catering to the drunk man saying hey listen we are all here to have fun but that was directed at me the sober lady that had been waiting patiently for someone to take my order.  The dumb bar tender should have asked if he could help me but of course he was too stupid to do that and the drunk was argumentative and apologetic you know an annoying apologetic drunk.  It was awesome.  The place totally sucks.  My husband and I both said that the whole vibe was a bad one, 0
One very sad day at 3am in the morning on the way home......(STOP YAWNING!) .... I hit a pot hole and lost control of my fifteen month old Ford. It hit a crash barrier at 56 mph. I was totally unharmed so well done Ford.  I phone the insurance company. They were amazing (Royal Sun Alliance - Through Bruce Stevenson). They told me life was going to get better as Evans Halshaw now have the car and would contact me within the hour to organise a replacement car. Two hours later no call. I called them. I was put through to the body shop and no answer. The people at reception said sorry it has been like that all day. At 4pm in the afternoon, 0
I just paid $10 for a dozen stale donuts.  Maybe it's because it's a weekend or maybe this location just sucks, 0

I originally got a groupon for the super shots and did it for three months with basically zero results. Then I did 43 days of the HCG diet and lost 35lbs. That is pretty typical results for males if you stick with the diet. I also completed 30 days from another clinic two years ago and lost 30lbs.  Initially I made an appointment to talk to the doctor and he wasn't there so that was a wasted trip. I wanted to start the diet soon so I went to there north Las Vegas location to see the doctor sooner then waiting a week for him to return to the green valley location. Despite the fact that I told them I would be going to the green valley location only they assigned me a diet coach at the north location. When contacting him it always seemed like I was wasting his time so I stopped talking to him. The diet cost $900 for 43 days and after 7 days he never got back to me. They had a sale when I signed up, 0
Skip this overpriced pub. My salad was brown and tasteless. The IPA didn't taste anything close to a hoppy beer. The water had a strange aftertaste. The staff was okay and mildly friendly., 0
Maybe I'm not hungry enough or perhaps I've had too much to drink but I think Ian's is overrated. While they do have very unique pizzas, 0
It is really sad that my first review on yelp has to be negative. First off I was excited that they opened this facility.  It makes it easier since it is on my way to work.  I decided on a Friday I was craving the lox bagel and a coffee. To my excitement it was done in an orderly fashion. When I got to work I couldn't wait to dig into my lox bagel and to mu disappointment there was barely any cream cheese. They slathered it just in the middle, 0
My husband and I eat Thai food frequently. We have had Thai food in many different cities, 0
*************Has This Happened To You ????**********     **************There Were Plenty Of Vacant Tables Available*********   My wife and I WAITED a good solid 5 minutes at the hostess station ....... it was UNATTENDED for the entire 5 minutes. In addition another group was waiting behind us, 0
The company was great had a few laughs but from the moment we got there we knew it was going to be bad service... We came in expecting to drop a few big bills on happy hour and our waitress was completely MIA the whole time we were there. And when we would finally get to order our drinks it took another 20 mins to get them. Worst part was it wasn't even packed. So within the 1 1/2 hour we were there  we decided to move on to Bar Louie.. What a difference and better ambiance! And service, 0
Meh.  Just the branding of the name and located in Vegas Strip.  I got gelato ice cream and it was overpriced. It was good, 0
My wife and I stayed here for only one night on our way back through from Quebec.  As mentioned in other reviews, 0
They have some nice stuff at ok prices.  Just a few things to remember:  * If you order something from their website that is out of stock, 0
Well Blaine...you should teach your educated staff not to tell new customers that if they upgrade to $19.99 plan that there's no annual fee!!!! Oh do I see a review that your efficient staff charged someone else's fee on their account. Yeah your staff are soooooo on the ball!!!!  You have such great customer service skills. I can't understand why someone would write a review on how rude your staff are when you set SUCH A GREAT EXAMPLE!!!   BEWARE!!! All the good reviews are lies!!!  There's a reason why the membership is only $9.99. The place is a dump and don't be surprise when you get billed with their hidden fees.  Don't bother talking to the manager because he has the check-in girl doing the new registrations when she is obviously not qualified. She doesn't even know what's on these contracts and she was using someone else's log-in to register. That should have been my red flag. DO NOT make the same mistake., 0
Customer Service FAIL: I called ahead EXPLICITLY to request 2 queen bed.  When I arrived, 0

Delicious Food great location, 0
Meh.  Extremely mediocre food.  Fine if you're looking for a pint or two but don't expect anything spectacular to come out of the kitchen - my husband and I have tried a few different menu items and have yet to be impressed.  It's not BAD, 0
Junk worse than McDonald. My wife is a fan of this shop in Fairfax VA. Westopped for a quick breakfast. The poppers were stale bagels hard and the worst thing was when they heated the egg omlette in the microwave. For someone who does not use this at home, 0

We only stopped in for a drink but the margaritas had to be the worst I've ever had. I honestly don't think there was any alcohol in it at all it or it was completely watered down. The chips and salsa were very good. The bartenders weren't the mist friendly but they weren't the worst. I probably wouldn't ever go here again., 0
Place is garbage. Food is horrible. Service is horrible. Wont be back., 0

Wanna drop a quick $300 for 2 mediocre mani/pedi's?? This is just the place! The manicure was extremely poor, 0
I am an avid second hand shopper. I love Crossroads and Buffalo Exchange. I was not impressed at all. If I could change the name I would call it My Mother's Closet. Everything was very matronly and the size selection was horrible. A lot of the stuff was extremely used and very overpriced. The ladies that work there were old and not very friendly. I wanted to try on some YSL sunglasses and I changed my mind because they were so rude and didn't even acknowledge my presence. My mother would like it there but I found everything kind of ugly. I wouldn't even give the store a second chance., 0
This company is a total scam. They charged my credit card a $350 unauthorized fee 2 days after I used their service and claimed someone had thrown up in the vehicle- which is totally untrue. The people that work in accounting are rude and will charge your card whatever they feel like with no authorization. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER over the phone. They will charge you fees you did not agree on. This company is a joke., 0
I do not understand the hype about this place. It's cramped, 0
My 81 year old grandmother and I had to leave because one of the servers was so loud during her extremely sexual conversation with another table. It takes a lot to make me blush, 0
I want to like this place so bad because it is across the street and therefore the most convenience place to eat and drink for my entire building.  This place is horrible. The food is awful and the staff are all snotty.  I have tried to eat there so many times.  The grilled chicken tastes like rubber and is always burned, 0

Stayed here for a frisbee tournament. The rooms have the exact ambience as your typical Holiday Inn; really got the old town Vegas ambience going. You know the scene in The Hangover, 0
Really bad jobs and very poor customer services in Madison ! I don't know why other people reviews who gave credit a few stars in this horrible place . I called for 2 appointments, 0
I hate the fact that EVERY TIME I've been here I've made an appointment and I still wait 30 minutes to an hour.   What's the point of making an appointment?!, 0
I have to say that I really don't like writing bad reviews but I just must recount a recent experience with Jose is Your Tailor that was VERY different from my original review.   As I said in my original sentiments, 0
The second time I went here- they missed a topping on the pizza so they put topping on pizza and refired it- which is a no no- great way to give someone food poisoning . and service was terrible.  We decided to try again- since the first time was not bad.  It took 10 minutes to get seated for lunch and then we waited with three children another ten minutes and never saw a server -   so we left and will not be back, 0
Do not choose this Hotel if you want to have a room when you get in town. I called the night before to check my reservation and they did not have me in the system nor did hey have a room to offer for their mistake. They were unapologetic and did not offer any other room as a replacement. The person whom answered the phone was confusing and did not know what she was doing! I will not recommend this place to anyone!!!! I would have a better chance at getting a room in the girls dormitory., 0

By far the worst drive thru experience in the United States. My husband & I stopped by for drinks (since it was a hot evening during our visit in Vegas). A tall, 0
I come to this location pretty much everyday~ staff is always friendly but the drink I order "venti iced stirred caramel macchiato" they repeat my order and yet again today I was handed "not stirred" and each day the wait at drive thru is getting longer and longer, 0
Crazy check in line.  They need to figure out something about that...and also they need to have a check in line and a check out line.  Their beds and beddings need to catch up to other hotels.  It wasn't soft or comfy at all.  Feather pillows aren't good if they're not top notch. All there rooms are too far down the hallways.   They need rooms to be closer to the center of the casino.  Our rooms were fine, 0
In short a casual bar and grill with a beach theme and enough TV's to entertain people during sporting events.   The food on the menu is standard middle class Mexican food, 0
Okay -- It's a bit quirky yes.  The food isn't all that great.  My ribs were cold when they arrived.  I got sick that night.  Enough said., 0
Compared to the store in Fashion Show mall this location severely lacks in both service and selection. If I am going to spend $100+ on jeans I would like someone to show some interest in me as a customer. For instance, 0
I pre-ordered a cab on Saturday night. Over an Hour Before 2AM. The Supervisor was supposed to call me back because it was 2:30am and we were waiting in the parking lot and They could not give us a straight answer on when the cab would show.  Well the supervisor that was, 0
Worst post office in the valley! I have lived in Vegas my whole life, 0

What a screwing this trip was!  I wanted to take my wife to a first class brunch, 0
Very busy. Service sucked. Undercooked carnita asada. Waitress took plate and fork. Personnel brought steak back after recooking..never brought a fork. Rarely saw out waitress til she brought bill. Bisboy excused her actions with waitress had too many tables., 0
Thinking about Matthew Broderick perhaps?  Erase that thought; this bar didn't really remind me of my college experience at all either.  There were too many meatheads, 0
Went to eat there for "Brazilian Wednesday" and I was very disappointed. The only thing Brazilian was this gigantic piece of meat which did not look very appetizing. The ambience of the buffet is that of a hospital cafeteria, 0
I was thrilled to see a new restaurant in the location Skillets had occupied on Community House Road. I was even more thrilled to find a coupon for a free omelette in my mailbox. So I decided to hike on over and take a taste. That was a mistake.  I took a seat at the counter and perused the menu. Omelettes and eggs benedict occupied most of the menu, 0
I have been in search of 3 things in this town.   1. Good Service  2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home.  3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.  After eating at Oscar's Steakhouse on Wednesday I can say I'm still looking!   I'll start with the service.   We arrived just before 6pm and were quickly seated in the main room with an amazing view. We were in a booth that sat a little higher then the tables so it really made us feel special. However, 0
I don't go to the movies a whole lot. Part of this is due to my picky nature, 0
Worst 15 dollars that I have ever spent and that was just for lunch. Let me explain.  I come in on a Wednesday around 11:30 am. I am greeted by the host and shown to a table. Since I have never been here before, 0
Last night I went to dinner at this restaurant with my sister for her birthday, 0
The fish seemed fresh but the rice was undercooked or at the very least overly toothy. That's got to be a cardinal sin of some sort. Service was friendly, 0

We went to Christopher's anticipating an excellent dining experience. We were sorely disappointed. We had reservations for four, 0
Cute place in a good little neighborhood however this was not my favorite breakfast spot . My husband and I stopped by to order omelette and traditional French toast.

I am giving one star because I could not give zero star.  I have been over the world and stayed in many different hotels in my past.  My experience with this hotel's host and customer service is just horrible.  Basically I spent 2 hours and talked to 8 different people tonight and still not able to get my room reservation issue resolved.  Out of the eight people I talked to, 0
The only thing that this Los Dos Molinos has in common with the Los Dos Molinos in Ahwatukee is the name.   The decor in this location is far more upscale - like a day at the ranch meets Dia de Muertos. We sat at a nice table in the back and immediately received a basket of fresh chips with green and red "holy f#%k that is hot" salsa. The other location served us bag chips but with a lot more palatable salsa.  To make a direct comparison between locations I ordered the exact same thing, 0
I contracted with this business through Living Social.  They got to my house and decided I had a "hazardous waste" issue because of my cats. I had asked the owner to contact me via cell on that day should any issues arise but instead I was informed through email without much detail (an did not see it until several days later).

Went in today  to try a new place for breakfast. I had corn beef hash and eggs with sourdough.  I think my 9 year old could have made me a better breakfast. The only reason I have 2 stars instead of 1 is my daughters' lunch, 0
Meh. This place very much lacks the excitement.  I guess for a child, 0
Normally I wouldn't review anything my husband, 0
I think if you grew up in north Phoenix you automatically love this place - like Peter Piper Pizza. Now that I am a grown up and have found all the amazing Mexican restaurants in town, 0
Had the house salad, 0
I had an awful experience here on Sunday. Service was bad. Our waitress walked right past us without an acknowledgement at all. When she did come over she said oh I thought you were the last people sitting here. I guess all customers look the same? I wonder how do u ruin Taco Salad and Chili? The Horny Toad sure can!!!, 0
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I am allergic to latex. This is what I had to keep on telling the nail tech when she was doing my feet. Walked in for a nice pedicure and I should have walked right out when I saw the look on her face when I told her I was allergic to latex.  But she said it's ok, 0
I would recommend skipping this restaurant.  Reasons to avoid this place:  1.)  The service is poor.  Example, 0
Do not go to DEANS auto repair unless you want to waste half your day and receive a bill you pay to get your car back that is a poor opinion of  what needs to be repaired.  What a joke this place has the b**** to charge $135 to open the hood for a few minutes and sit on the car for an hour and call you back to say you need to clean out your gas lines, 0
Food was pretty good but I was totally put off when they charged $12.95 for a kids plain cheese pizza! It was the most expensive item on our receipt. I wish the waiter would have given us a heads up. Left feeling cheated. I would not come back., 0
I just got off the phone with this company asking to be removed from their telemarketing list... wow the guy did not even ask me why ??  I had plenty to say about him, 0

This is anything but NY pizza...average at best and way to expensive!....If you want REAL NY piazza got to Bounos in Mesa (gautalupe & dobson)..It may be a hole in the wall but has the BEST piazza in the valley...take it from a person who grew up on NY piazza!, 0
Night manager was rude and unprofessional. Yakking on personal phone calls on the sales floor rather then assisting customers...was even rude to fellow employee who was actually helping the customers! This woman is unbalanced and clearly suffering from some mental health issues. There is no way a person who verbally assaults others should be allowed to work in a retail setting....ever! Not to mention the threat this type of loose cannon individual poses to society in general. Jeez, 0
Went awhile back with a Groupon and just ordered some basics like a cheese pizza, 0
I have been coming to this Lens Crafters for years and was really disappointed today. There is a lack in customer service and the way I was treated when inquiring about retrieving my prescription after I had my eye exam there before a change from Maricopa county's insurance. It was almost like they didn't want to help me/give me my prescription because they weren't going to be making the sale with my insurance now changed and no longer accepted there ... even though I had my eye exam there before the changes, 0
I have been going to this nail place for over a year now, 0

Traditional American style food. For the price, 0
So I came to Vegas on an all girls trip and probably should have thought better than trying the Asian food. I got sucked into the beautiful interior. A huge tank full of gold fish. It was almost too much like the didn't have any room to swim.  It's well lit and wasn't busy, 0
I am yet another Urban Active member who endured the transition to LA Fitness. I won't even bother going into details about that as several other reviewers already have, 0

Well where should I start?  I made the reservation on open table about a month ago and was looking forward to this dinner immensely.  I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and we ate at Burgur the day prior.  We had a 7:30 res and arrived on time. We were asked to go to the lounge and wait for our table as it wasn't ready yet. At 8 pm I approached "Erica" the hostess and asked if she knew how long it will be until the table was ready, 0
There were 8 of us that ate here during the weekend, 0
I just don't know what to say- except Tony needs a firmer grasp of the American language. I have no idea why my reservation on the phone just now was so difficult-  Tony over & over again kept saying (for example) "I need a credit card on file to book the reservation, 0
I'm not sure what to say about this place. It's dirty, 0
I certainly will not be back to this place.  I've been coming here for years - but I think it's under new ownership now.  The man who helped me was so strange.  Once he took my order he told me to hold onto my ticket because people have been eating other people's food  Mind you - I was the ONLY ONE IN THE PLACE.     While I was sitting and eating my sandwich, 0

Fine dining...not so much.   We recently went for dinner with the theme being everything we picked was great and everything Morel provided was blah.   The decor was light and bright with all of the windows to the strip. The TI pirate show would periodically erupt, 0

Went in for my first ever Juicd Life at the Biltmore experience after hearing about it non-stop on JohnJay and Rich... Never going back. My juice is so delicious, 0
The service was great but the food was horrible. I had a chicken sandwich with a side salad. The salad looked like it was swimming in a pool of Ranch dressing and the salad itself looked old. The chicken sandwich was plain., 0

The staff here was awful! There was a huge line and four people just standing around not helping anyone. We even asked what the problem was and were informed that only one person was qualified to operate the register. Once we were seated, 0

Smug crooks!!!!! I recently acquired a 3 month old puppy who was enrolled in the Wellness Plan at the local Banfield pet hospital. I was asked by the previous owner who was unable to keep the puppy due to personal reasons if I would take over the payments on the plan and continue the puppy's care with Banfield. Being relatively new to the area and knowing nothing about Banfield I was ok with that and agreed to do so. Heres where my troubles began. I went to the local Banfield to switch the account into my name and make payments on the account and guess what.....yep, 0
generic sports bar/pub at the monte carlo...we were staying here and needed a place to rest before leaving for the airport...luckily it was happy hour so the cheap beers and $1 wings and sliders was a good deal and a good way to cover some time...  wouldn't suggest this as a must-stop though!, 0
This was my first time ordering from Gus's. I got an extra-large cheese pizza, 0
I used to dine at Jardin de Panos frequently but  it's been resting on its laurels and it's gone way downhill in the past years. The place is still packed with lines out the door during peak times but I think that's just the remnants of its reputation. There are other BYOW places that are much better in the Duluth area. Jardin de Panos is not much better now than the generic BYOW Greek places around Prince Arthur that mainly cater to tourists.  To date their decline, 0

Five years ago I reserved two tires at Dukes gave them the exact sizes that I required told him I would be there in 15 minutes to pick up the tires I rolled up with a couple friends of mine from Baltimore who are part of the LGBT community the yinzers at Dukes took one look and told me that the tires were sold they had no more tires., 0
I've got mixed feelings about this place. In terms of their state-of-the-art equipment and quality of care, 0
This is by far the worst shopping experience I have ever had.  The Factory and Garden is wonderful. However, 0
hmmm I don't want to be too harsh. Everything was very so so here, 0
On October 26 me and family went to heritage tavern for brunch.. We were expecting a great service and great food.. But we did not recive that. The service was bad. The staff rush us to order the food... The food took for ever and the place was empty, 0
Disappointing location. The one on Cooper and Baseline is much better. The fries were mealy and salt deprived. The Royal Burger fell apart and the meat didn't have much flavor and was excessively salty., 0
Wishing I could say something nice about eating here. I got the chicken teriyaki which had a slice of canned pinapple and some sauce over that. Vegitables seemed to have been cooked in a microwave, 0
Joy, 0
Let me first say that this place has good food.  We've eaten there pretty regularly by delivery only with no problems until tonight.  Here is how it went down.  I called to get my regular Milano's special and wanted to substitute mushrooms for fries (like I always do) and I was told to "hold let me ask my manager".  Then the lady (obviously new) came back to the phone and said "you can only substitute onion rings".  I said I've done this 10-20 other times so don't see why it's different now.  She said sorry manager said no.  Then I asked her to speak to the manager.  She said "no he's busy unpacking boxes". I then proceeded to tell her that I would  never again order from that establishment and hung up.  It's ashame because they have really good food but this one horrible customer service episode did it for me., 0
Not awful - just not good either.    Staff was a plus.  I've almost never had a bad experience w/ Hilton staff.  The downside to this stay were thin walls, 0
I feel like I'm at the dentist office.  What is the deal with the florescent lights.  Food seemed like left overs., 0
Don't waste your $ on less than par food.  I am eating the seafood sampler as I'm writing this and "it sucks" is a severe understatement.  The eggrolls are horrible tasting and have a weird texture. The crab cakes are bready with a small amount of crab pieces and have a strange taste.  The only thing edible are the shrimp which are your standard breaded shrimp you can get for $5 at your grocer's freezer.  If you're craving seafood don't bother getting it here.  You will leave hungry, 0
We wanted to like this place but it failed our expectations.  After driving 25 mins to get there, 0
I've been to lots of Cora restaurants, 0
I would give no stars if allowed. Betty at checkout was extremely rude and abrasive. However manager working at the rear of store was helpful and gets the star here., 0
No f-ing way.  Over an hour's wait and $43 later, 0
This review is for the Scottsdale Red Robin, 0
This place was awful! I went into the restaurant on green valley pkwy. I got huevos rancheros  to go  as I work at an office nearby and was craving breakfast. Eggs were not cooked at even though I ordered them hard tortilla was soggy. They didn't put ant cheese and forgot the potatoes. I could of made a better meal in the microwave at work. It was defiantly not worth the almost 12 dollars I paid., 0
Do not be fooled by the location.  This is easily the worst "Mexican food" I have tasted in my life. The only thing Mexican about the food might be the description on the menu. I ordered the Tequila Lime Tacos and they honestly tasted like cardboard.  The staff is attentive and quick and the venue is somewhat welcoming but the food is simply unacceptable.  If the food was edible I might have given this place two stars to recognize the staff and their speed, 0
I'd bet they do most of their business during the week with a nice slice and drink special. We went in on a Saturday afternoon, 0
The casino is clearly in need of an update. It's very old and out of date. The staff was not friendly at all and were pretty rude at the craps tables., 0
This is Mexican food for white people. Not horrible, 0
Terrible onion rings, 0
The woman who cut my hair was neither friendly, 0
Went for lunch yesterday..... As far as the food was concerned, 0
NEVER EVER EAT HERE!  YOU MIGHT DIE!!!!!!! It is so disgusting.  The food tastes like grease and the omlette was scary.  A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!  It reaks of smoke and is just plain nasty.  The only good think about it is the sign.  If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.    And I like diners.  My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities., 0

This place was a major disappointment. We had heard a lot of good things from a lot of different people so we decided to try it out. We sat at a table in the cocktail area for about five minutes before our server came over. Instead of greeting us kindly, 0
I would never rent from this company EVER again. The ladies in the office at The Monarch on Coolidge st in Phoenix are completely incompetent. My hot water was shut off without them letting us know, 0
Been a resident at Veer towers for a year and have heard nothing but good things about Mandarin bar, 0
Not impressed. Not impressed at all.   I took my girlfriend here for a nice birthday dinner. We were staying at Aria and didn't really want to stray too far from our hotel. We both enjoy Italian, 0
Wow!!! If you would like to be greeted and helped. And gosh ...even just treated humanely!  :\\ I advice you do not shop here at scrubs they are so mean the 2 older owners were gossiping about a customer who called and started to fight. Their culinary wear is limited and over priced. I tried some chef  pants on and asked if there may be some smaller in length? ? ( I really didn't know ) they both were angry and said I can buy them and go get them altered.  (Ok!) But I felt so bad I truly was turned off to give them any of my hard earned money. The one girl they had working there though she was really nice... Darn didn't get her name. But don't even waste ur time on these poor customer service people. I'm so disappointed, 0
So after years of hearing that we need to try Burger Bar, 0
Half star if possible. After being a loyal Cox customer for 25 years, 0
Terrible. Wait time for a shuttle was 2hrs+, 0
I'm going to have to agree with Aletheia here. Why is this place deserving of such buzz? I fully expected the interior to look like a dive, 0
There are several things anyone has a right to expect when encountering one of the plethora of Emeril's restaurants, 0
My worst pedi experience ever...  Went to polished to get a basic manicure done for Halloween and it was pretty good. Only 5 minutes from my place and fairly good reviews.   Came back today for a pedicure and left without polish and a cut toe. Swelling and throbbing...it kept bleeding! In need of some color on my toes, 0
OH MY GOD I HATE BEST BUY.  I went looking for NBA Jam for XBOX 360 for my husband's birthday... generally, 0
We were in the neighborhood and my brother wanted a good burger so we decided to come here. I should have checked the yelp reviews first!  lets start with the decor. I feel like I'm in a slaughter house with all the red and then they put cow hide on the bar chairs, 0
This place is just ok...there is nothing exceptional about it!  I wanted to love it, 0
This place is very expensive at practicaly 30$ a plate. I ordered the scallops which had no flavor. The portions were small. I ordered a side salad with my meal which would have been alright if they wouldnt have drenched it in lemon juice which was pratically unedible. The service was horrible they left 2 dishes that my family had ordered in the kitchen until we told them they forgot our food. Im personally very dissapointed and personally would never return., 0
Last December after quiting my job I quickly needed something to pay the bills.  After having trouble on my own I decided to test my luck with a temp agency and let them do all the selling for me.  I went into their office to have a sit down with one of the reps, 0
Upon getting the rental car we asked Nick (the day's manager it seemed like) to note that there was a fair size dent in the middle of the hood.  His reply was that it was less than 2" and not to worry about it.  We still requested it be noted but apparently he did not.  At least he was decent enough to mention his name so I knew who to refer to upon returning the car. However, 0
I did carry out here because I really wanted to try their salt and pepper wings. I also ordered some chow mien and fried rice. The wings had a weird after taste to them. They were not that crispy either. The taste kind of turned me off . The chow mien was decent .  The fried rice was generic tasting. I typically rate fried rice based on if it would taste better than how I would make it. I would have been better off making my own. I 'm glad the rice came with my order for free due to their coupon. Their rice is comparable to Panda Express. I expected more from China Tango because they are not considered to be a fast food chain so  I set my expectations higher.   The food didn't leave me wanting more it made me lose my craving for wings. The sides were fine but the chicken really threw me for a loop that left me queasy!, 0
Average at best.  I have been here 3 times, 0
Since the renovation, 0
I want to give this place a better rating, 0
Yawn.... oh, 0
I hope the cook just needs to learn to prepare the food properly! We had sandwiches that were only warm but the cheese was over cooked it was hard.  It is expensive for a quick stop lunch.......  the atmosphere is okay.  I have had better experiences at other Panera Breads!!!!  Not in any hurry to eat here again or recommend it again!!!!, 0
I read most of the reviews, 0
I can't vouch for the renovated part of this hotel because they were sold out and we ended up booking a room in the unrenovated area, 0

I would like to preface this review by saying that I have NEVER in all my 24 years been compelled to write a review online.  My experience today was so upsetting that I felt it had to be shared.  I live in north Las Vegas, 0
Overpriced and nothing special. They attempt to have gourmet pizza by having gourmet toppings, 0
Do NOT order the wings. For $14 you get scrap parts of the wings, 0
First they charge you a resort fee of 22.00 per night up front as well as 50.00 a day deposit so right off I was charged on my "prepaid" hotel another 223.00 upon checking in. Staff is cold and not very friendly. No real help to their guests, 0
I've been to Siglo twice and both times it's been a last resort, 0
I had a really bad experience with my nail technician and it was my first time being there. I don't want to point her by name but she was so negative about everything and kept saying she can't wait to get off work and not come in the next day. She kept rolling her eyes and even freaked out when she thought one of the other nail techs stole her nail polish but it was sitting in front of her the whole time. I told her that I wanted a full pink and white set and she didn't even do that. She put regular acrylic and made me go pick out a color.  She even made me bleed and when I pointed it out. She looked surprised and said she'll clean it up for me and continues doing my nails but never cleaned the blood up. She did not seemed interested in being there and doing her job at all. I prepaid through MyTime app and she tried charging me. I kept telling her that I already paid for the service and she did not seem to comprehend that. It's unfortunate because the guys who were doing other customer's nails seemed very upbeat and friendly and knew what they were doing but I will never go back because of the one pessimistic nail tech who did my nails, 0
The worst ever check in experience at this hotel. They want to charge $180 and $50 for early checkin. This establishment does not care about if you are marriot platinum member pr what not. Front desk is caos they dont even a standard response for common questions. Marriot member dont bother coming to this establishment because you will not be treated the same. All these guy care about is their small fees no regard to your loyalty to Marriot brand as staff told me they just work with marriot not real affiliation., 0
Eck. i feel like this is the worst Dunkin Donuts ever.  Different from the one in Asia, 0
I think this place is out of business.....no wonder...it sucked, 0
My husband and I do not get a lot of vacation or alone time together. I was so excited to go to Las Vegas! But The Flamingo was awful! The hallways smelled. The size of our room was ok. They only had a room with 2 beds for us-( fine if he acted up my hubby could sleep in that bed ) Our toilet flooded the first morning and it took them 2 hours to bring a plunger. I was disgusted! This place was like a Motel 6!!! I will NEVER stay at  the Flamingo again. In fact I feel the need to go to Vegas again just so I can have a happy experience., 0
I can best describe this as "drunk food". If you're drunk and it's late and you don't have a ton of money, 0
Went there late Saturday afternoon before the dinner crowd rush and wasn't entirely blown away by the experience.   We sat outside, 0

BEWARE. The guys at this carwash are unsavory and unprofessional. I got my car detailed and when they were done I discovered that one of the buttons on my radio had come off during the cleaning. They also took drycleaning out of my car and didn't put it back in necessitating me to drive across town to get it. They said they would replace the lost button from the radio but after 3 calls asking them to follow through they stated dodging my calls and hanging up on me. Read other bad reviews on these guys, 0
just really funny how i try to buy a pet in there and whatever the lady calls him as a boss? and he doesnt want to sell it to us, 0
My brother talked this place up and wanted to take us there. After eating there, 0
I will not be going here ever again., 0
Horrible margarita, 0
I almost don't even know where to start. I went here on Valentines Day and the thing that I will always remember about CV is that you do not go to nice restaurants on Valentines Day.   I had 7:30 reservations for two. Arrived two minutes late, 0
Absolutely the worst service ever. This restaurant needs to rethink how it treats customers as apparently the customers are at the bottom of their  priority list. They need to train their staff to treat customers with respect. Given that their food is way below the standard of the amazing restaurants nearby, 0
for the money you can find better, 0
Came in to have glasses repaired.  Ended up with cosmetic damage on the exterior of the frames.  These are $600 frames.  Repair tech offered $10 off, 0
I never complain and this is the first reveiw I have ever written, 0
Service was terrible. After being seated we weren't acknowledged for around 10 minutes. Once we were acknowledged we ordered food and the server promptly ran away when we had yet to order beverages.  We had asked what a sauza sunrise was and two separate servers had no clue. After ordering, 0
The pizza is pretty good but the service could be A LOT better.  Came here for takeout on a Monday night.  When I got in line, 0
The food was pretty average. The place was rather dimly lit. The establishment itself wasn't very clean. The floors were sticky, 0
Saxby and I ate lunch here today with some friends after trip to the Children's Discovery Museum. The food was ok but nothing really stood out to make me want to return. I shared the B.L.A.T. and the Shrimp Po Boy with the other adult we were dining with. Both came with a side of potato salad. When I think of a Po Boy I imagine a subroll bursting with fried shrimp shredded lettuce and tomato finished with delicious aioli. This "Po Boy" was on a ciabatta with sauteed shrimp, 0
A triumph of style over substance. Walking in the place had a positive vibe, 0
I am not a fan of red lobster, 0
We were so excited to try this bakery. Unfortunately, 0
Ok breakfast not so much my toast must have been toasted and then sat for twenty minutes while they made my breakfast the home fries are cut up French fries I ordered the skillet with peppers onions and sausage when it came out 20 plus minutes later not overly hot  no eggs I guess it doesn't come with eggs. My wife had the egg sandwich which she said was ok when it was time to pay I gave the server 20 dollar bill on a 16 dollar tab she said thank you and never came back with my change so I could decide on the tip it would have probley been 2 dollars not 4$ ....... Consistency people like I said in my last review good wings beer and salad, 0
This is my first review as a yelp user and I've made this account specifically because of how bad my experience has been here. If I could write a worse review about the photo department at this Walgreens I would. I live in the general vicinity of this Walgreens and have taken film there to be developed multiple times in the past month. Of the three times I have brought film to be developed here the staff has managed to ruin two of my rolls. I have taken film photography for more than a year and know how to handle film properly. In these cases I bought disposable cameras from that same Walgreens and returned the cameras around a week later to have the film developed. The first time i assumed it was my own error but after my most recent experience I know I am not at fault. Not only did the staff have no idea why such a thing would happen but also they could not find the roll of film to return to me. This most recent time I had to wait for close to an hour while they rummaged through their stuff trying to find the film. When they actually found the film and gave it back to me it was completely blank, 0
First let me try to say something nice . . . um . . . hmm.  Well, 0
I met someone who raved about this place so my sister and I came here today to try it out. We thought the seats were really uncomfortable and cold if you aren't wearing pants while sitting on them. But decor aside, 0
THESE GUYS ARE CROOKS!!!!   The service department deliberately caused a leak in the gas tank just so I'd have to come back and have it repaired again, 0
I visited this Shark Reef in August while on vacation and I was blown away by how much it cost and how little the actual aquarium was. Before going inside, 0
I'm a local and as such maybe a little jaded due to our seemingly never-ending string of poor dining experiences at expensive restaurants on the strip that tout quality chefs. Sadly, 0
We sat outside patio. Waited 10 minutes for service. Then waited 10 minutes to get my beer. Wings came no ranch. When asked again waited. I assumed was the manager in blue button up long sleeve shirt asked how our service was. After telling him how bad service was he made the excuse that waiter had too many tables. Don't see how that is a good reason for our bad service.   Upon leaving manager in blue shirt looked at us but never said bye. Even appeared to be bad mouthing.. This was my worst Buffalo Wild Wings experience. . Thx yelp!, 0
If I didn't have to I wouldn't even give one star. HORRIBLE SERVICE! I've never left a review but I'm sitting her for the past hour waiting for a coal. This is my second time here and we came back because we had a good experience the first time. Our waitress hasn't checked up on us even though we went up to her asking for a coal after mean mugging her for 20 mins. Pathetic. After waiting an hour we got up to pay and didn't even finish our hookah. Confronted the waitress and she has the audacity to say "I'm sorry I didn't know!" Asked to talk to the manager and he wouldn't even talk to us and chose to talk to the waitress instead. No compensation for the poor service or not being able to smoke what we paid for. Manager was a guy named Vince or Vincent. Let's just say if you're expecting to be respected and to receive the service you're paying for DO NOT GO HERE! I can pay the same price or lower and receive higher quality hookah and service at many other locations in the Charlotte area., 0
They did not take our number when ordering take out, 0
I've recently been trying to find a cool place to play shuffleboard in North Phoenix.  I was trying to find a place to hang out near my bro's house so we could go hang out for a bit and have a beer.  I found Brennan's online and noted that they had shuffleboard.  WIN WIN!!  The review said that the staff was friendly and called you "honey" even if it was the first time you had ever been there.  BANG!  sounds like my kinda joint, 0
I WILL NEVER again order from this people. No taste in that food, 0
I don't even know where to start.   I guess it starts from another social media website. A friend had liked their page and so I started following the page out of curiosity and quickly became intrigued.  Let me tell you folks, 0
i do not understand why everyone loves this place  1. it is extremely over priced 2. had a burger and it was burnt and was extremely dry 3. slow service 4. burnt veal parmigian   I would not go back to this place, 0
What a mess.    Luckily we ended up getting a table and having a private area and bottle service which was fine.  BUT... the hour before that happened was a nightmare.  This place is ran so poorly compared to the 10+ other nightclubs I've been to in Vegas.  The music is 90% hip hop and the crowd is much older and trashier.

Had a dinner reservation to see the sunset at 7pm. Arrived at 6:45 to wait until 7:40 for a table. Many other parties crowding the waiting area for the same reason. No communication from managers nor hostess (whom was very overwhelmed and doing her best). When finally seated after sunset, 0

I was craving Dairy Queen for quite awhile.  When I finally went I was wondering what I wanted it so badly for?  I ordered a grape freeze.  The icey slush mixed with soft serve vanilla.  It was was so mediocre.  I felt like I was wasting calories for the day.  If I want a treat I can think of such better/higher quality treats and ice cream., 0

Quite disappointing.  I was looking forward to trying Rao's for a long time and tonight my wife and I were in the area and decided to go.  The two main problems I have with Rao's are the prices and the service.  Took forever for the waiter to take our order, 0

Came here for the Star Trek Convention (woot!)... and honestly... they made it Star Trek themed drinks and played Star Trek on the screen... but the bartender was really rude.   I paid a lot of money to enjoy my Trek time and we wanted to order drinks from the Star Trek Drink Special menu and the guy grabbed it and threw it and said "I've been taking orders from this all day. Order something normal"  Uhh, 0

I don't often post a review unless something is exceptional or awful.  Wife and I decided to try the food truck at the downtown Summerlin opening.  We were excited about the food trucks and chose this from the enticing menu though pricey at $10 a gyro.  It was a bit later...around 9ish and little to no line.  It took close to 40 minutes to receive two gyros.  I hoped that, 0
Bangkok 9 is now just a shadow of its former self.  It is no longer my place to go for lttuce wraps as it no longer has them on the menu.  There is quite a lot missing from the menu now.  My roommate and I walked out last night because they did not have what either of us really wanted.  We wont be back.  Perhaps the food is still good.  I would not know.  For Thai in the North West, 0
This observation wheel was high on my list of things to do this trip to Vegas. I romanticized the view of the city in my head but the actual experience fell short. I couldn't find the hours online but we arrived on a Tuesday night about 11:30pm. They informed us that the last riders would have to be on the wheel by 12. After paying nearly $80 for our two tickets, 0

Be careful with this company. They are dishonest.  The agent I was working with gave me a quote that included $75 extra. When I questioned him about it, 0
I usually will only write good reviews but the experience was so bad here that I needed to do something about it. So here's my experience:  1. The food was hit and miss. My fianc\u00e9 got the Double Dog Dare which was decent. I got the 1842 Burger. I asked for it medium and instead got it burnt. I could literally taste the burnt outside with every bite. Quite possibly the worst burger I've ever had. I couldn't ask for a new one because I never saw my server. Which leads to my next point.   2. The service was awful. We saw our waiter one time to order and that was it. No drink refills no anything. After having had finished, 0
My wife and I ended up spending a night there, 0
The worst buffet I have ever been to the wait was only 30 min but considering the food selection, 0
I would not recommend Grandma's Kitchen to people with young children. It is supposed to be a kid friendly restaurant. I guess just not for children 3 and under. I admit my son's ages 2 and 3 were a little noisy. But I did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite. Grandma also telling my children to use there inside voices. I immediately responded by saying 2 year olds do not understand what an inside voice is and left the restaurant., 0
We came here one night for pizza and had an unpleasant surprise.  The pizza we had was so incredibly salty that after a piece I just couldn't eat anymore.  My mouth felt saturated with salt the entire evening.  The waitress was very nice., 0
This place used to be amazing! Quick service and very prompt with your drink/food order! One night (about a month ago) I took family here to enjoy a birthday. After I paid and made it to my car the hostess ran out like I never paid at all. They ended up charging me for the wrong bill.... So in addition to paying the bill they charged me they recharged me for the right bill.....It is now almost 25 days later and they charged me the amount they were supposed to charge me 25 days earlier.  There's one thing that you need to look out for with "quick orders" and that's making sure everything's cooked... Not cool when you get sick an hour after.....we will be taking a casa Don Juan brake., 0
I went here for the first time to satisfy a pregnancy craving for Pad Thai. I don't know if they forgot to ask how spicy I wanted it or just assumed because I was pregnant I didn't want it spicy but I ended up with a plain lack luster plate of something I can't even call Pad Thai. The noodles were skinnier then regular pad Thai noodles and the taste was quite bland. I am giving it two stars because the waitresses were nice and attentive. But I wouldn't ever return, 0
A fan of Target just not a fan of this location. Parking is abysmal if you elect to park on the same floor of the store itself (this is a parking deck). There are stairs and an elevator for access. Entering and exiting said parking deck is a bit of a pain because of the traffic in the area. It seems like the few times I go to this particular location, 0
Food and drinks here are a lil overrated. Staff is friendly enough, 0
Worst Customer service in town. Sales staff are uneducated in their product., 0
I have eaten her only a couple of time and today I was not too impressed.  I felt rushed and the sandwich was not too tasty.  It was a little bland.  I added some hot peppers after a few bites to give it some taste., 0
Just a warning... this is only an extension of the Venetian and not really it's OWN hotel... They do have their own rooms and a waterfall but no shops and nothing else to look at. I'm sure the rooms are great but it's sort of just like an extension of Venetian... It's like what Encore is to Wynn but Encore is 1000x better and is actually it's own separate hotel although still connected to the Wynn... Just FYI.  Was absolutely disappointed after hearing about the NEW PALAZZO only to find that there's nothing but a waterfall to look at. I've been to vegas too many times, 0
Bad customer service the female that took my order in the Drive Thur had a bad attitude. I ordered the number three double cheeseburger and fries and small drink. The food was horrible. You can tell everything comes frozen  you can taste it. I would not recommend this to anyone., 0
I was really looking forward to trying this place it had good reviews and wasn't too far from home. It was a week day around 5 and it was pretty empty so we got a hibachi grill to ourselves. We put our orders in and not too long later we got some miso soup which was  different from most miso but I liked it. The salad was the typical salad with ginger dressing. The chef came out shortly after I think his name was Joshua. He did the normal shtick but was very dry, 0

Really bad. 1 star food at a 5 star price. Definitely avoid eating here. I had lobster and it was so overdone but yet it was priced as if it were fresh from the dock. Service was week. They had a huge group come in and it got so out of control. These girls acted as if they were in a pizza parlor, 0

Hmm.  1. Apparently if you come alone they will assume you are just there for pickup and let you stand expectantly for awhile.  2.

My girlfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. We were led to a table outside and told our waiter would be with us in a few minutes.

I decided to braid my hair but ran out of hair I happen to have from California. Reading the reviews about the huge selections if hair I made my way across town to come check it out.  I didn't have problems with dirty looks from the locals around there or anyone panhandling like others have had. The workers greeted me as soon as I walked in and were there for my every need. Unfortunately I was very disappoint to see that this really wasn't a warehouse as I expected. They seem to have more wigs than anything.  Aisle were very bare and they had a lot of old, 0

I was very unimpressed.   We started ordering our food and some college kid actually pushed in front of us while we were placing an order and started ordering his own food. The woman at the counter turned away from us and decided to help the kid who had just walked in a stepped in front. When we were able to order one of our meals was forgotten. After requesting the forgotten food the woman brought it out and slammed it down on our table. It was all a very strange and confusing experience, 0

I can neatly sum this establishment up with one minor observation: The price of a can of Coca Cola is \u00a31.05p. That's nearly double what you would expect from any other convenience shop and frankly is extortionate. Indeed McColls sells everything you would expect from a convenience store: papers, 0

I'm a bit of a conspiracy theorist when it comes to the Banana Republic outlet (or at least this one!). I'm convinced these clothes were never actually in a real Banana store and were manufactured exclusively for outlet sale. Why should this matter? Basically you are buying cheap knock offs.   I have a lot of items from Banana Republic (the normal store) that I love and would buy duplicates of in a heart beat. I see them in the outlet store and the quality is so bad it's insane. The materials are different and the cut is different. It's weird because the styles are the same as the normal store, 0
Saw the place on travel channel... Looked awesome... Bought the yelp deal prior to getting there!  Bad choice!  Waited 15 minutes at counter for the one person running the entire place to take our order.  I hear other people ordering and the employee told them that they were out of many items they were ordering!  Then they had no change to make when people were paying their bill!  Last... Food was horrible... Salty, 0
I've stayed at this hotel only 3x and don't know why I bothered to give them another shot.  Thinking their attitude would improve...me thinks not.  1) Was there around Thanksgiving this year and the quality of the rooms were as follows:    a) Carpet corners looked like a cat/dog has been chewing and naw-ing on them for the last few years.  Bathrooms had wallpaper covering OLDER wallpaper.  Why wouldn't you strip it and just redo it or paint it?  The beds were HORRIBLE....the mattresses clearly were not replaced in YEARS.  The TV -- we now have LCD and what's with the old cabinets?  We had 2 little lamps and one electric socket that wasn't working.  2) When explaining our unhappiness with the room, 0

This place tries too hard and ends up seeming ridiculously tacky instead.   - The men who filled our glasses refuse to speak anything but french to me. But dude spoke english at the end of the night. - Service was bad. Lots of waiting. - While the meat is clearly a decent cut, 0

This is right in our hood so we were very excited that an esteemed chef chose this locale.  We showed up at 730p on a Friday. There were no tables so we decided to sit at the bar.  The bartender was a really nice guy. We were impressed it was busy, 0
So disappointing.  I was expecting so much but my salmon was so bland and dry that I didn't finish it.  My friend said her chicken was just on edge of being bad.  Meaning with a slightly off taste. I could make a better salad but my friend said her soup was good.  After dinner we thought we were being kind to move to the bar so our server could seat someone else at her table.  Turns out the bartender didn't take kindly to our sitting there (not busy at the bar) and suggested we should go somewhere else if we weren't going to order more wine.  After a bottle of wine at dinner and spending over $100 I think we should have been okay to sit for 30 minutes.  I won't be back., 0

After checking with the front desk on how to find the rooms. Odd on this side and even on that side???? Then ac in only one room( we had a suite) &the one bedroom didn't have a Tv plus the Tv ( living room)was an older style.  The refrigerator wasn't on so now we put our stuff in the freezer.  We are glad we are only here for the weekend and will not return to this one:-( also keep your shoes on....total black feet( carpet needs a good shampoo). The breakfast was good but needs to be restocked earlier. Also the keys didn't work 3 & the front desk wasn't too helpful. Plus the pool isn't 24 hrs but at 230 in the morning people were swimming.... if you stay here which id advise you dont- stay away from pool side, 0
Went during the day yesterday and was reminded why I don't do that more often. The lunch special was cheap, 0
Awful!  Worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  I wish I could give negative stars. -I wanted to look at a menu but the waiter/front of house guy kept pushing the buffet. So we reluctantly gave it a try - I wish we had just left the restaurant.  -food was mediocre at best once you got past the fact that it was dry cold and tasteless  -the ambiance was dreary and the incense was nauseating. -there is also no place to change a diaper  in addition to the fact that the bathroom was not stocked with toilet paper or paper towels and the floors were grimy and sticky GROSS -when it came time to pay I WAS CHARGED $100- no joke!!!!   When I brought it to his attention he acted like I was the one inconveniencing HIM!  Then, 0

Why does this place have 5 stars?  And why are so many of his reviewers out of state? Who brings their car from New York to have it fixed by Gene?  I went to Gene's shop with my car and he did incorrect work which did led unnecessary work, 0
I don't understand how this place has gotten so many good reviews. The food was awful. I had the Biscuits and Gravy with sides of sausage and toast. The biscuits and gravy had a weird aftertaste, 0
In my opinion I would not stay here. There is no parking and Valet was full. We had to park at a different hotel and walk. Be aware and on your toes because in the lobby by registration at the bottom of the stairs there are time share sales people who are very aggressive. We go to Vegas often and usually stay at the Tropicana. We had a deal and made the change- we will not make that mistake again. Getting in late on a Friday night we could not believe the element of people- we were actually concerned for our safety. Lots of drunks and a very low class crowd- we were shocked that one scary and loudly fighting group were not being escorted out. My boyfriend was almost pick pocketed by a prostitute who got in the check out line behind us. We will not ever stay here again. Our worst experience in Vegas ever., 0
I love Vegas!    But I'm... never impressed with this airport at all... it's so old and is in major need of remodeling!  It always seems dirty to me, 0

I had been anxiously anticipating when I was going to be able to try this place. I had heard so many good things from reviews and friends but I was underwhelmed with the food and the service.  We went during happy hour after we did the Yelp Shopping Crawl so the place was packed and the atmosphere was nice. We sat outside but the space heaters kept us nice and toasty.   We didn't have to wait to long before we got our drink orders in and we started off with an order of the soft pretzels and fondue. I have had this same dish at Culinary Dropout and they are so good (plus during happy hour they are a discounted price so even better).   I ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe which was pretty good (I did like it didn't fall apart like crazy), 0

There's three different ways I've judged the different Starbucks locations over the years.  1.  Speed of service 2.  Quality of their brewed iced coffee 3.  Friendliness of the staff  This Starbucks was the definition of mediocrity.  The baristas were numerous during the day time, 0

DO NOT go here! Worst place I've ever had my nails done! The place is completely empty. There's no music or massage chairs. The "manager" is extremely unprofessional and kept complaining on how sick she was and stayed in the storage room on her phone. When she actually did come out she complimented on my ring and asked what it was. I replied with Tiffany and she threw it down on the table and called me a spoiled brat!  2 other people walked out because only 1 girls was working. My pedicure was good but my gel mani was horrible. I was there for over 2 hours and only ended up with a pedicure because she messed up my gel. I was so frustrated by this point I told her I didn't even want my nails done and she still charged me! $60 for a pedicure and a "mani" that looked worse than when I first walked in. I will never be back here.   The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because the girl that did my nails was super nice., 0
I decided to give this place a try after seeing all the of the great reviews.  Sadly I was disappointed.  I orderd the steak pita and my husband orderd the lamb.  My husband is a big eater and I don't often consider any complaints from him about portion size to be conclusive but in this case I was also underwhelmed.  Both pitas were far smaller than what we have received at other greek restaurants (Greek Bistro, 0

Had great expectations for this restaurant and was highly disappointed.  Arrived early and sat in the lounge.  My husband had to go to the bar to get drinks for us since the server was nowhere to be found and never acknowledged our presence.  I had a mojito and there was no visible mint in my drink.  WTH!  Was seated at our table at the time of our reservation. The server told us that we could NOT order an appetizer first, 0

We heard great things about this place so we thought we'd try it.  Maybe it was a bad night....but we had terrible service and food.  They never came over to refill our drinks or check to see how our meal was.  When they finally came over at the end of our meal to see if we needed anything else and to bring us the bill.......we told the waitress that the chicken dish was terrible and we didn't eat it.  Her response was, 0

Americanized Sushi.  Decent but not for asians.  Fun place though.  Bennihannas type of jap bbq show on one small side of the restaurant.  Definitely a tourist or hotspot to checkout though.

We went to Saito's with a group of 14 for New Years dinner. Despite calling to confirm that a table would be ready for entire group, 0
Typical Greek fare you'd find in any taverna downtown/plateau, 0
Absolutely horrible service. When you have 20 people in line having 3 terminals open doesn't cut it. Especially when the workers work slower than molasses. You have one who just looks like they don't want to work (which is pretty clear when they came and left not even 20 minutes working getting through maybe 4 costumers), 0
I kept hearing that this place might be as good as NYC pizza in my hotel room.  I decided I had to check it out and it turned out to be the cheapest place to eat at the Wynn hotel.  A 12 inch meat lovers pizza was about $15 which is a good price for anything on the strip!  The staff were super friendly and took my order.  I was a little excited and a little giddy considering every time I've ate at the Wynn I've been extremely happy with my experience.    The pizza arrived, 0
I love to bake so I love going to bakeries and checking them out. Seeing Buddy on tv led me to believe that his pastries would be top notch since he always seemed so caught up on quality on his shows. The pastries were very over priced (I paid $21 for a small canoli, 0
Went with a friend to sample dishes from this new establishment.  I had the garlic cheese sweet potato - arrived warm, 0
I cannot believe how anyone can like this place. May be the service was bad the day I went. I walked in .... then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant. But, 0
2 stars just because they do have awesome food.  The service is horrible, 0
How do I say this, 0
Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, 0
This place is terrible.  If you want to eat mediocre food, 0
I LOVE AMC and going to the movies however, 0
Based on all the positive reviews I had to try this place. Service was good but that was it!  7.95 for a half dozen tamales.  You get what you pay for!  They were dry and chicken was tooooo spicy.  A one time thing!!!  Tried beef, 0

Food was good typical del taco but service was slow I only got my food because I went up and mad dogged the girl who took my order. I won't be coming back to this location., 0
Food was great but the staff including the manager could use some hospitality training. Not the service one is used to at NM. (All the other caf\u00e9s are great. And I frequent them often) Would not go there again. And I used to love it here;((, 0
I've been to Namaste once and had the lunch buffet. The food seemed very stale and the quality passable. Not at all something we'd frequent again. The topper is the fact that Namaste has been shut down multiple times for health code violations. That just does not sit will with me.  The recent reviews seem to suggest the food has improved. I'm not sure about that as I don't dare eat there after my first experience and their hygiene issues., 0
Mediocre overpriced threading. Maybe I'm spoiled by my shabby little nails/threading place in New York, 0
I know I said I hate "chain" restaurants...but honestly I really do.    We were looking for a reverse happy hour and this was close by so we gave in.  The beer was cold, 0
Ahhhh now I get it, 0
So...I hate to give a place with high reviews low marks, 0
One word: Awful.  1st dish: Kare-Kare lunch special -  Veggies on top (beans and eggplant) was COLD! As in straight out of a tupperware container from the fridge COLD! As with the two mini lumpia shanghai that comes with it - they too, 0
I had really high hopes for Fern, 0

Worst Customer service ever!!! Bad bad experience with the store manager and one of their employees. I can't believe a store like this will argue a $2 extra for Chocolate sauce! I paid for it, 0
Ill trained and inattentive staff. Wait staff was completely disorganized. Took 5 mins to be acknowledged for seating and then another 10 mins to have our order taken, 0
Unbelievably slow service, 0
This is NOT the best brunch in Charlotte. It's a small chain located in a shopping plaza full of families with their 2 strollers and screaming children. The food was decent but I'm sad I made a drive this way for brunch., 0
I'll get some flack for this one, 0
So earlier, 0
Do not go to firestone! They have HORRIBLE customer service and have shady business practices. The feedback survey they currently offer ($10 off $25 or more on services) is NOT anonymous despite saying so. JOE from this location made a point to bring that up as he mistakenly thought i submitted a survey on our interaction of just scheduling an appointment. If he looked at the time stamp he would have realized I submitted the survey PRIOR to coming in...Regardless to even bring that up to a customer was shocking and showed exactly why he was rude from the get go of just today's conversation.  Firestone is notorious for adding on additional unneeded services, 0
This cafe rio is the worst I've been to. The workers are rude & the rice was just so dry, 0
I am being generous with two stars. I am here now and it is terrible. The app was not tasty, 0
Ive been here on multiple occasions and I have never been fully satisfied. The wait staff is poor. On one visit, 0
Awful customer customer.    We scheduled an appointment for today for quote on a new AC unit.  They called me 2 times to confirm the appointment.  Today I receive a call saying they're not coming.  If a customer is treated like this by sales when trying to buy a $6000 air conditioner, 0
GO TO THE ORIENT HOUSE NEXT DOOR....Had the double cooked pork and instead of pork it was bacon. I don't know if they forgot which type of pork is usually used but it was very disappointing. I recommend next door instead., 0

No no no!   Save your time and money and go right across the street to direct.   Prices at Hollywood are too high for the cheap products they are. 98% of products are NOT in factory sealed or labeled containers, 0
We bought tickets for our family of 5 on our vacation to Las Vegas last week.  It is time and money we will never get back.  When we saw that Rick Harrison himself endorsed the show we chose to spend our money on it as we love Pawn Stars on TV.    It isn't the actors fault they just didn't have much to work with. I kept waiting for the funny parts but instead found myself continuously checking the time to see when it would end.   I felt ripped off as we were there for a limited time and had only a certain amount of time and money to spend.  Mama Mia, 0
I wrote a long review and Yelp wouldn't log in and I lost it. Don't want to waste another moment on this place but really feel the need to warn others. Stopped here at 4am on my way home from dancing and anything would have tasted good. Except my meal was unedible, 0
Great friendly service, 0
I conducted a last-minute small meeting at this location and without a doubt will not be conducting anymore meetings here.  1) The meeting rooms are on the 3rd floor & the bathrooms are on the 1st... do the math.  2) Nobody checked on us the entire day to make sure everything was acceptable. I guess they knew it wasn't!  3) The AC unit in the meeting room was so loud that we had to turn it off and suffer through a hot meeting.  The Sales Manager followed up with me and really didn't have anything to say, 0
had the chicken schwarma. it was too dry., 0
Ordered so much food to be delivered.  It was my sons birthday.  Cheese fries ....gross.  Chicken fingers no flavor.   Pan pizza .....so much dough and sick flavor....threw it away.  I don't think I would give it to a dog.    Chicken Caesar salad....yuck.  Sandwich....horrible.  Subway is much better.    Nothing good to say and spent over 60.00 feel burned.  I will not be returning...to bad because they are close to my home., 0
A couple of friends and I have been going to this location for a couple of years now. We will not go back due to their lack of customer service. Last time we went their "Happy Hour" bud light special was $5.50 and when we inquired with the waitress she said that it was discounted for happy hour. We then asked to speak to a manager who we saw 10 minutes earlier. She said she did not know where he was, 0

Met my wife there for lunch on a week day.  We got there right as they opened because they fill up pretty fast.  The music inside was way too loud.  Practically had to shout to have a conservation.  The burgers were ok, 0
This place was nothing special, 0
I am in love with the menu at Culinary Drop Out! Any place with a raw seafood bar is a win in my book. Pretty much everyone front of house is attractive and the place hums with a laid back vibe while maintaining a posh yet edgy atmosphere. So why the two star rating?  Everything sounded better on the menu than it actually was- everything just fell short of expectations. The service here was just terrible. The worst service I've had all year, 0
Nope. This place sucks. My buddy thought it would be neat to get two hotel rooms for $50 (total). Yeah, 0
What a snooze fest. I actually got a deal  on expedia, 0

Expensive.  Problem with this place is that a guy with SUPER greasy hands took my keys and my got in my car.... yup, 0
FRUSTRATING!!!  Worst experience ever... everything about the hotel was "ok" on the two days we stayed...    but this is why i'm reviewing them... to help my fellow yelpers...  the customer service is the worst. I paid with expedia and my debit card was charged for $135.90. Although they said it would only be for incidentals...  I called December 31, 0
Used to be my hobby store of choice.  I bought several RC cars and parts from them.  I have also referred people there to buy drones and RC cars.  I now cannot recommend Hobby Action.  Must be under a lot of pressure these days.  Customer service is now nonexistent and if you are a novice forget about it..  Yes, 0
This place is way over priced for regular breakfast food.  Might as well go to Denny's for half the price.  Even the bacon (namesake) was not even thick cut bacon.  It wasn't burnt I guess..  And why do they have hershey bags everywhere?  I didn't see any chocolate on the menu...  Oh, 0
When service is this bad, 0
Sat at the sushi bar for 10 minutes without water/service or even a greeting.  Yelp recommends? Thats disappointing.  I have been driving by here for 5 years, 0
Tried Geno's for the first time today. Might have had too high of expectations for this place but I was disappointed.   I ordered the provolone cheese steak with mushrooms. It had NO flavor. The only way it tasted alright was because of the red sauce that was on the table. A bit overpriced too. I wouldnt pay 9 bucks for half a sandwich that is going to taste like nothing. (Had to buy fries separate because the sandwich didn't come with anything else...) wich is another thumbs down.  My boyfriend ordered a chillie cheese dog, 0
Way over priced for the amount of food you're getting. $12 for a half sandwich and a small cup of pre-made soup (stated by the manager) and they served us cool bread.  My vegetarian wife found a small piece of chicken in her vegetable barley soup. The manager disclosed that the pre-made soup that was shipped to their store may have already been contaminated with meat before they served the soup in the store.  So you would think that they would make fresh soup for the price you're paying. He did say that he would file an incident report and dispose of the rest of the box batch.  We were compensated for our food, 0

No. Re-Model was horrific. Poorly micromanaged..What was a classy room with private subdivisions is now an open mess hall of plenty of rude players. Bad Management as well. if your local, 0
Checked in 3/11/12 1:30am for one night.  I accidentally left my I.D during check in at the front desk.  Didn't realize until later that day.  The lost and found Department closed Sundays by 4pm.  I went back Monday morning around 9am ish to the Security Booth Lost and Found.  The fat white man at the booth was a complete A-Hole.   I wasn't rude when I showed up.  I had never lost anything before and this guy expected me to know the routine.  Why do people always assume you know the routine when dealing with customer service??  I sure as hell don't and I am in sales.  Always treat the customer with a smile no matter what!!  He finally got someone to bring my I.D to the booth after 20 mins of waiting.  The girl was looking for 2 other items this fat security had on his desk in a bin.  He could have easily handed me my I.D and I could have been on my way.  He decided to put my I.D on the side and take his sweet ass time looking for the other 2 items that took another 15 mins.  I felt like slapping his ass into next week!!  NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY IN THIS HORROR PLACE!   The rooms were not that great.  Place was really dirty like everyone had told me., 0
I don't understand why people love this place. I've been here a dozen times.  The beer selection is decent. The prices are good.  The bar food is typical.  It is just a standard bar to me.  If you want no frills beer and bar food, 0
Definitely not worth the money. Dirty, 0
Went here before the Coyotes game. Food is horrible!!! I mean horrible!!!  We (3 of us) had the "steak sandwich" which was barely edible. Parts you couldn't even chew threw it. Our server was nice and gave decent service.  Don't eat here, 0

Seems to be a common theme here. I sure wish I would've researched Haven Homes before becoming locked into a 12 month lease with this company. I have had Several maintenance requests go ignored since moving in 3 months ago and had to threaten not to pay my $2300/month rent in order to get service the last time. I am now 5 days into my new request which is supposed to have a 48 hour turn around and I have heard Nothing. No big surprise there yet I am having to manually open and close my own garage door every time I arrive home or leave because it is not working for the 2nd time in 3 months.   This company is a JOKE and it's an absolute Money PIT. If you value your time, 0
Avoid this place. They tried to hustle my girlfriend for a $45 dollar basic oil change. Until I showed up and got a $10 "discount"   They have false advertisements and constantly change their prices depending on the person who walks in.   They need new management or ownership in order to stay in business.   I will never return., 0
I really thought this place would of worked out from all the decent reviews it had...  The only thing that I liked was the fact they have the triangle shaped mozzarella "sticks, 0

I was walking around the neighborhood and decided to stop in for some lunch. It was about 3pm and there was no one in the place. The cook was sitting on a lawn chair outside and the bartender was on her cell phone. Jen, 0
I hate giving any place 1 star but I have to.  Tried 2 gelatos -- mango and salted caramel. The salted caramel had no sea salt at all and was too gooey and overly sweet. The mango was sour and did not really taste like mango.   Given the $9 we paid for these 2 individual separate scoops, 0
Mediocre food... Lito the guy serving the ice cream was not friendly. :( first visit and last visit. The warm crab legs are only for VIP members. :o(, 0
Lots of adjectives come to mind. Dumpy. Ancient. Moldy. Quite far from the heart of downtown (by Charlotte standards). Most rooms don't even have a minibar. Nor do they have nice TVs.  The wifi speed was decent though. That's always a plus., 0
Same here. Bought 4 TAO Beach tickets for Markus Schulz & Ferry Corsten Sunday pool party during EDC. Neither will call nor the bouncers at TAO Beach had heard of 1NS group before. Missed half the pool party to run around the Venetian to deal with these issues and even then, 0

Well I have read nothing but great reviews and I am currently sitting in the docs office waiting to be seen after being here for 1hr 45 mins after my scheduled appointment. The staff up front is lazy and they are not proactive at all. I set there listening to personal conversations and everything else that crossed their mind that was non work related. How about calling your clients to let them know how far behind the Doc is... I hope this man walks on water as its go an be hard to get me to change my mind on this review!, 0
Poor poor service, 0
Hey there last night we ordered pizza. 45 minutes later the manager comes out and tells us they d ropped the pizza on the floor. so they are going to make us a new 1. an hour and 20 minutes. it took to get 1 pizza. and how much did I pay. full price. great customer service for making a customer wait so long, 0

This place went downhill fast.....well it wasn't exactly a long drop to the bottoms of the barrel but still what was a decent selection good tables and good pick up games has become a shadow of its former self and isn't even worth the five minute drive from my house anymore.  This place once had many redeeming qualities but no longer...here are the major issues...  Staff- unfriendly dishonest slobs who couldn't give a single f*ckk about paying customers Tiny I'm looking at you....waiting to purchase three squads of de and other misc merch yesterday but you were too busy socializing as usual (we waited a full 20 minutes for you).the other dude behind the counter.....well the wheels are spinning but the hamster died a long time ago.  We walked out....again at this point I shouldn't be surprised with the way you treat customers you must give the owner one hell of a reach around while you are pumping his business and reputation into thhe ground.  Selection -has gone from excellent to non existent since the move....this shouldn't be a blip on the radar in the next year as its painfully obvious they aren't restocking anything. And given there prices are full retail (or more in some cases shop around youll laugh) I'm surprised anyone is purchasing from them at all.  Basically every positive from my last review and in general is gone and this has turned into another rapidly failing gaming cesspool.  I hope they close quickly and get it over with.  Two words....game depot enjoy it it smokes this place., 0
Judging by some of the previous reviews, 0
This is the worse Carl's Jr restaurant I have ever been to.   --The drive through speaker is low volume. The manager has been saying since it opened "we are going to fix it soon" But it never gets fixed.  --Three times within a month the wait in car line was excessive. Sometimes reaching as long as 7 minutes waiting for the person to take my order. There is hardly a wait to get in line because I guess people are starting to hate the bad service. But imagine when you get to the speaker and the person asks you to wait and you do...for 7+ mins!  --The manager and district manager have been called by me two times and still they do NOTHING to correct the simplest of problems.   I have just gotten used to driving to the Carl's on W Craig. At least there the staff knows how to run a restaurant. To bad too because this one is closer to the house., 0
I wish I could give separate stars for food and service. This place was very busy when we walked in, 0
Bad service bad dancers bad customer service. I understand everyone has a preference in girls but pregnant chicks should not be strippers, 0
I've been here a few times and am never really that impressed. The place is always crowded and loads of diners waiting to grab a seat but I don't understand ... it must be me. Tried the protein pancake and it wasn't cooked all the way through - the middle was still wet. Ick. Flavor of the pancake was decent but nothing to rave about. One friend tried the egg breakfast - good but hash browns were undercooked and another the protein waffle - very good. Service is very good here and the place is clean. But are they hurrying with the food to seat the diners waiting? I don't know but I probably won't be back to find out., 0
Skip it! If i could give no stars (or) negative stars i would.  It's overpriced, 0

This place is so overpriced it is amazing that they have any customers.   You can go to any mom & pop pet store or bigger chain store and find anything that is here... but for about 30% less.  For the same food I buy about a mile or two away at Sunflower Pet Supply, 0
Been here twice now.  The first time, 0
Having moved 15 times and having been referred to Classic Delivery- WHAT A NIGHTMARE.  VERY unprofessional and S L O W!!!!!!!  A move that should have taken no more than 6 hours stretched out to 10 hours.  The movers seemed to be strickly out of prison....just a TOTAL HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Would DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMEND., 0
Took an hour for the appetizers to come out. Another 20 for the meat. Steaks were all cold(8 of them) and all rare when we ordered medium rare to medium well. Kept blaming the big influx of the michael Jackson crowd but we were the 3rd table to be seated. They suggested that we regrill oursteaks at  30 min before half of our party had to be at a show. The sides came out fiveminut es afterthe steaks.    Five members of our party didn't get to finish their dstaks and went to theshow hungry.   Three of us remained... Unfortunately. Second round of steaks were off again... All ordered medium well but some were yndercooked andsome overcooked. The waiter responded that that's how its done here?  Skirt steak too peppery as well as the brussel sprouts. Spinach was good and the MAC and cheese was alright.  Gen manager came out and offered us to feed us after the lion king show and gave us his business card which was out in front for everyone to take anyways. He was disingenious. We were not happy and he asked us in a no- so nice tone, 0
The fact that this place is so crowded at lunchtime just confirms my suspicion that most Scottsdale residents have more money than taste.  This place is aggressively mediocre and proud of it.  You could get better Chinese at Applebee's for a lot less money.  I had to load on the soy sauce and chili oil just to make my lunch have any taste at all, 0
The scrambled eggs with croissant were good. Ambiance is non-existent. No french bakery feel at all. The products looked semi-appealing. Had a really hard time trying to find the damn place as it is hidden under a gargantuan office building. I would not by any means call this a "great" french bakery., 0
Stay away! Looks can be very deceiving. I just hurried home to finish this review. The outside of the restaurant/bar beckons at night with it's pretty lights and false promises. I was craving Italian and it was after 1am. Yelp was temporarily down or I wouldn't have even bothered with this place. The atmosphere was nice upon arrival. We seated ourselves at a booth. The server was pretty nice but his service was so slow. We both ordered the fettuccini alfredo. The bread with marinara sauce which was served right before the pasta was horrid and literally dripping grease. The food came quick but the service after that was really lousy. We waited almost 20 min. for the server/bartender to come back around to ask him for refills on ice tea. The fettuccini was so bland bland bland. I had to force myself to eat it. I left more than half the food on my plate as did my companion, 0
If Chipotle served margaritas then this place would be out of business. I was not impressed with anything. The one feature that I liked about the restaurant was part of the building design...the light mist on the outdoor dining.   Food flavor was mediocre. Ambiance was eh. Menu selection was limited., 0
Classy vibe with decent service and appetizers but entrees were disappointing.  I ordered the lamb shank special which was tough and barely warm.  Meanwhile, 0
Kudos to LGO for the neighborhood dynamics. I am pretty loyal to this grocery due to their consistent quality, 0
I reserved a long time in advance for a friend's birthday.  We requested a table in a quiet section and this wish was granted.  The service was ok.  The decor is nice.  It is a bit loud and crowded.  The food was ordinary.  I was expecting better., 0

Was disappointed when the restaurant was DNA and again disappointed with the new concept. Doesn't look like they changed anything from DNA except the menu which makes the atmosphere for an "Argentinian" resto a bit off.   It wasnt bad, 0
I think this place is definitely a matter of opinion.  This place certainly is NOT great, 0
My husband and I got "married" here on in 2010--we loved the drive-through and wonderful service.  Rev. Nature Woodall did a fabulous job of making our quick little ceremony special and we really enjoyed the non-traditional aspects of the chapel--the service was religious even for a civil ceremony which I would have passed on if given the chance...  BUT the chapel never sent our marriage certificate to the recorder's office (as evidenced by my attempt to get a certified copy through the proper channels).  Now that I am trying to get insurance coverage for my husband, 0
Poor service right from the start we waited 45 mins for table when they told us 15 mins max, 0

Poker Room Review:  Playing poker here is harsh.  First, 0
Poor. I don't understand what all the hubbub is about over this place. The meat was dry and lacked flavor. It tasted like they bought frozen meat and used that instead of smoking it themselves. I was very disappointed with the food. If you want real bbq, 0
So I went here on a very busy night and service took seemingly a lifetime and after the 1st drinks (took 40 min).. went on a slow night.. nearly the same experience my water sat empty for 30 min as I ate my spicy food.. I had to barrow my partners water.. lame! On the plus side the food was okay!, 0
I had a terrible experience with this company. I took a bridesmaid dress in 8 weeks before the wedding. I was suppose to pick it up in 1 week. I waited 2 weeks. I got there and she forgot to do it. I was very understanding, 0

Nineteen is truly the magic age for when this bar will be one that you actually voluntarily go to (and like it) .... all you need is a convincing fake and not a fake from the 21 year old entrepreneur who sold 5-12 copies of her driver's license to desperate minors. The bouncers notice that crap and chances are that 21 year old is a regular at Brother's anyways.  As previous reviewers have said, 0

Suite is the typical night club with the combination of go-go dancers and mainstream music. I think Wednesdays are college nights so they're 18+ and weekends are the typical 21+. There is a strict dress code (for guys anyway) so be sure to dress to impress. Guys wearing the "Dickie's" brand and boots will automatically be turned away.  I recently discovered that it is actually a franchise. With that said, 0
The worst pizza I ever had ice tastes like sewer. I ordered a sub the meat was old and bread was stale. Service sucked don't it here unless you want a stomach ache., 0
Horrible! After taking our food to 3 different tables, 0
Nothing positive to say about this place. Absolutely awful. We ordered three plates at lunch. Shredded beef tacos: no beef, 0
I wouldn't go back here...  Took 40 minutes to get an order of eggs :(  The manager corrected the time that it took me to get my food instead of apologizing.  Bad food BAD service!, 0

Boy you people just won't give me a break on the photo thing....One of these days I promise but in the meantime here goes the review....this used to be a really great spot but lately it is lacking...We stopped in yesterday for a quick cocktail and to meet a friend....no great happy hour specials and no happy hour food at all (sorry but in this economy I'm kinda looking for a break). I wound up having the cactus margarita which I asked them to make with Sauza and it has to down down as the WORST top shelf margarita...I realize times are tough all over but it tasted like lemonaid and if there was tequila in it I sure couldn't taste it.....won't be coming back. We left there and went to Sierra Bonita where my expectations were more than met....please check out the review., 0
This place is horrible.  The service is very rude.  They refused to put letters on a shirt for me because I had my own letters, 0
I don't know why you would go here. There's nothing here that you can't find at the Albertson's in the same shopping center, 0
Horrible experience. They make you wait outside the club inline for no reason because was empty. I had a female promoter walk up on me & my husband with a beautiful smile ( could not hide behind it that she was under the influence)  she said loud & clear : open bar for ladies $15 & gentlemen pay $10 for cover only. When we got to the door things changed.. they charged $40 for both of us. -.- really? At that point, 0
This was mediocre.  Its definitely NOT the bagel cafe which they seem to be trying to mimic.  The corned beef hash isnt "the mother of all hash".  It tastes homemade but not as good as other homemade around town.  If you're hungry dont order "the classic benny".  My boyfriend order that and got what looked like two open faced sliders with hollandaise sauce. We shared a bagel amd even that dissapointed us.   Besides that it was tiny inside the restaurant and stuffy., 0
This place is descent. There aren't many Chinese food places in the area and does it job when Chinese is on the mind. Although the ambience is far from delightful it makes a nice in and out place for take out on the way home and the service, 0
As soon as I walked in I knew that I had made a mistake.  There were so many people in the waiting area that I had to fill out my new patient paperwork in the lobby of the building.  There were children running around and not a very professional or calming environment.   This is the first time that I have used my vision insurance to see a optometrist in a couple of years.  I thought that this year I would find someone on my plan and try to keep it simple and get my exam and glasses done all at the same time.  Another decision that I was soon to regret.    My appointment was at 4pm and there were so many people in the waiting room that I thought I would be waiting for a very long time.  I got called back to see the Dr. at about 4:23pm.  I thought that was pretty fast considering how many people had been waiting.  I soon found out why.  My time with the Dr. was less than 5 mins!  I have worn glasses for over 20 years and have never had such a brief exam.  I was in and out so fast.  I felt I was going through a revolving door.  I guess that is how they go through so many people so quickly.    I was told to sit down and wait for my prescription.  Once my prescription was completed by the Dr. I was instructed to go to the glasses area and that they would have my prescription ready.  So, 0
Did you LOVE the midwest in 1992? Like really really love the midwest in 1992?   Good news! They brought northern Wisconsin in 1992 to the Las Vegas strip! The rooms were mighty mighty cheap, 0
Nice store. The lady who took my order was having a lot of conversation with her fellow employees as opposed to listening to the order.  All the tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  My wife doesn't like to bring food home because she would rather enjoy right after being made. We wont eat in again because we had to listen to the staff gossip and eat at a dirty table.  Food was consistent with other subways but run by children., 0
I couldn't believe how dead this club was on a Saturday night. Nearly half of the tables for bottle service were empty. Over all, 0
Horrible webhosting company.  I spent 7 years with them and watched as they progressively got worse and worse. I finally switched to Dreamhost and couldn't be happier.  Average website load times went from 10 seconds to about 1 for my site.  Ipower has had horribly overloaded mySQL database servers for years.  What's worse is they lie about it. Avoid this company with a 10 foot pole, 0
I have tried this location 3 times to make sure they got a fair shake. The food here is terrible and the quality is a shade of what Native used to be able to offer. If you want good wings you will have to drive out of Santan Valley. Try Wingstop or ATL and you will be much happier. This Native really seems to have poor quality and a lack of management., 0
They dropped off menus at my company and I thought it looked yummy.  Got a group together and ordered for delivery.  Over an hour later, 0

We were in town for the NASCAR races from California meeting up with friends from Idaho and Washington who are Harley fans who wanted to go here. I found a Restaurant.com coupon for $75 off a bill of $150 thought it would be great since there was 8 of us! Food was ok and our waitress Angel was nice. We had a nice time until our bill came after the $75 off and the $20 credit for parking the bill still came to $207 we said that there must be a mistake then we were informed that any alcoholic drinks served in their glasses we also paid for and could take them home!!!We said but we don;t want them can't you take them off the bill? "No, 0

The Rusty Dory is the large green monstrosity where the River Road Inn used to be years ago.  The decor is non-existent--make no mistake that this is a dirty dive--which would be fine if the atmosphere or drinks could make up for that.  But neither does.  The drink prices are average for Pittsburgh, 0
TERRIBLE SERVICE AND HORRIBLE RETURNS.  DEHYDRATED SPINES ON THEIR BOOKS, 0

Stop with your secret society password deals!!  Last few weeks Pizza Hut has a carryout deal called the Hut Lovers deal. Which is a large two topping pizza for $7.99 carry out only. The caveat is that you have to specifically say "Hut Lovers deal" in order to get that specific deal. If you walk in and say "what carry out specials do you have?" They will deny that they have any deals.  So yet again, 0
Their sushi isn't really anything special. You can get it just about anywhere.  We went there tonight, 0

I'm new to Hertz after a change in our corporate contracts.  This was my third Hertz rental in a week having had cars from San Diego and Salt Lake City which were both great experiences.  For a petrolhead like me Hertz is a massive improvement over Avis with a much better selection of cars.    However my experience in LV wasn't as great as the other locations. First off my car wasn't ready when I arrived, 0
This store is small - which isn't bad, 0
Trying way too hard on aesthetics and not trying hard enough to book people in UN-occupied rooms. A terrible experience handled terribly, 0

BUYER BEWARE!!!!!    My wife had a tire losing air so I decided to look on Yelp for some place with decent reviews and I picked Fletchers which is right around the corner of my house.  I asked them to patch the tire and then rotate the tires.  I took it in the morning and they called me finally late afternoon and I expected them to tell me that my car was done and I needed to pick it up.  Oh Noooooo.....  They told me that the puncture was on an edge and unfixable and that I needed a new tire....and the tread on the other three tires is also unsafe...and went into a sales pitch that I had to cut off. I told the sales guy that I would be there in 15 minutes to pick up my car and that I would take it someplace else for a second opinion.  My wife has a friend that told us to try Gene's Auto Works in Tempe....a little far but way worth the drive.  Sure enough....they took the tire off and found the hole smack in the middle of the tire.  They fixed the tire on the spot in 15 minutes....told me the tread on my tires is perfect and we were on our way......Fletchers has lost all of my future business and is very unethical.  I would be very careful before I let these guys do any work on my car and know they will try and scam you for sure!, 0

Perhaps it's Superbowl weekend that made Boa seem sub par, 0
It would be a cool venue if the staff didn't have such bad attitudes. The fact that I remember the head of security being a douche more so than any of the awesome bands I was there to see equals a bad time....which nobody wants when they pay their hard earned money to attend.  It seems to be the same issues this place had in Tempe. Overly aggressive security....bad attitudes from all the staff...bad sound..overpriced drinks. I will never go to this venue again. I hope 13th floor gets it figured out and finds a new venue to book shows.  Note to the security staff....YOU ARE NOT THE SHOW. PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE TO SEE YOU AND IF THEY REMEMBER YOU...which they always seem to...IT'S BECAUSE YOU AREN'T DOING YOUR JOB CORRECTLY.  Club Red = LAME., 0

Been here a few times and not by choice either. Food is not good. Limited options for kids as well.  The service is slow and overall not worth it., 0
I want to like and support the local merchant every chance I get! However in the case of Basha's Surprise location it is not easy.   The layout of the store is odd depending on the entrance you use. Why the produce is all the way on the opposite side, 0
Service was good. But the food? Where do I begin!!  First the food took like an hour for it to get to our table.  Then when we took a taste it was one disappointment after another!  The meats didn't taste very fresh at all. I lived in the south and if they are going to advertise BBQ they should learn to make ribs that falls off the bone instead of fighting with a dry piece of rib.   Service on the other hand was good. If now the food can meet the service they would have a gold mine., 0
Out of the times I been to Vegas and all the clubs I been to. Light has the worse customer service. Although their venue is legit. Their service won't make me go back. They create the longest lines to let walk ups who pay the bouncer in first. They move their pre sale line slow just because they have paid already. They scan your ticket an hour before you enter to leave you with no choice but to wait in line and enter the club. Their guest list line moves slower just so they can make their money and deny guest list. By the time you walk inside the club, 0
Bar area was great, 0
Seems like we eat at this Todai often when we come to Vegas. It's a tad better than the other locations I've visited but I am not crazy about their sushi. It just doesn't taste all the fresh to me. However, 0

I took my fam here cuz a couple of the Asian girls at work highly recommended it. (I would hope they would know the best place to go) The outside looks like it neede a fresh new paint job.  We got seated right away but then we went before the lunchtime madness.   The food to me was very salty.  A lot of everything I picked.  The chow fun was quite tasty though.  The har gaw did not have enough shrimp in it.  It's been a while since we went there but I just know I don't like it there very much., 0
The food is bland and service is suspect (slow)... clientele is senior citizens which I personally don't mind... food is a little expensive given the mediocrity of taste. I have been there twice now, 0
I ate here on last weekend and thought the burgers were really good. Although... A friend and myself became deathly ill that night. If you ever had food poisoning it is not fun. I know for a fact it was from there., 0
Stopped in at about 11:30 on a Saturday.  The place was busy (it is small so it doesn't take much).  The noise was very loud.  My friend and I got squeezed into a small table between two other groups that were yakking away.      the place is very urban chic.  The waiter stopped by quickly but after looking at the menu and not even being able to concentrate on it because of the noise we left.  If  you like going places that make you feel like you are hip, 0

Really good tacos. Generic beer selection. Had a slow/rude/lazy Bartender., 0
Only redeeming factor was red sauce.  The refried beans were tasteless slop.... more like lard soup with a few mashed beans thrown in. Also tasted "off"  The rest of our meal (chicken enchiladas) were edible but a far cry from the quality available elsewhere.  Even though the place was not full, 0

Don't bother anymore .. Last couple of years they have gone from good to okay to just plain bad. Ordered a taco with everything and two gorditas to go..  We waited over 30mins..

Manque de service aux caisses ! Souvent plusieurs clients laissent leurs achats et s'en vont. Dommage puisque ce n'est pas le nombre d'employer qui manque, 0
I will start this review with the fact that I have had absolutely nothing to eat here.  This is because we made a reservation for 7:30 and upon arrival were snubbed.  We checked in with the host at 7:25.  At 7:32 an older man and his girlfriend walked in.  She immediately began rudely letting the wait staff know that they had a reservation and was concerned that they were not immediately seated.  At 7:34 she let them know again that they had a 7:30 reservation (same as mine).  The hostess then said, 0
Wouldn't let us in because my friend appeared to be too intoxicated. This was after the Chandler beer and BBQ fest. We had been drinking, 0

Took my Saturn ion to them in July for transmission problems. They had it a month and said it was fixed after spending over 2000.00 on the parts. They then charged me 650.00 for labor. After a week or two the car started acting up so I took it back. They had the car for a week and after I called them numerous times said it was a celluniod that needed replaced. They told me they would call when it was done. They never called I had to call them. They said it was fixed again. So I picked it up. I didn't even get back home when it did it again. I called them and they said to bring it back. They had it a week again and said they would call when they knew what was wrong they never called I called them. They said it was celluloid and they replaced it. I picked up the car and drove it home. Not more than a mile from the place it was doing the same thing. I called them while driving home and they said it was fixed that there was nothing wrong with it. They said if it was broken the check engine light would be on. Which it wasn't. I took the car home and it completely died on green valley pkwy. I stopped and turned it off. Then I started it again and it would go but only a few feet it died in my apt complex's gate way .I pushed it to my parking spot where it sat till it was reposed because I won't pay for a broken car. Basically I would not take my car there for all the money in the world. They are untrustworthy, 0

I can't even give this a one star yet i have to for this post.  I am out of town on a business trip and we made a reservation for 12.  We were told that we would get one table and as we arrived there was two tables to accommodate us.  We had no problem with this.  As our server arrived; one of our guests asked for a $50 bottle of wine yet we were told to "pick up the wine list and tell what we wanted". But we knew the name.  Then numerous guests at our table were told we were not sitting directly in front of our napkin/place settings.  At this point we asked if we were inconveniencing him to be there and asked to see a manger.  The short gentleman approved and was so rude and condescending to us.  He stated he was a manager but we later found out he was the son of our waiter.  We immediately left; but was followed by the servers son and was cursed and flipped the bird.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.  Don't waste your time.  Once we realized we were speaking with an owner and she had to tell the gentleman faking as a manager to stop staring and threatening us to leave our presence, 0

Incredibly slow service in the mornings.  I've stood in line for 15 minutes just to order one cup of coffee when there were only 2 other people in line.  They are all very friendly but their multi-tasking abilities are extremely poor.  Not a good combination in that line of business., 0

Dinner buffet. The food look old. Crab legs and carving station look like some 9.99 buffets. Dinner is 50.99. But I would not eat here if the price was 20 bucks. I was smart enough to ask them to let me check out the food first. 5 stars for me., 0

Two stars only because the fries were decent. I hate the thousand island taste of their spread and they do not have mayo. The burger was strictly ok. I really have no idea what all the hype is about other than some people like lots of stuff on their burger. If you like a simple burger that's juicy and offers lots of topping choices and the best fries, 0

Tried this pizza tonight-worst ever.  No flavor at all. Frozen pizza would have been better.  Will not be back, 0
Absolutely horrible. Don't bother coming here. We came because its and Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut so everyone could get something they liked. We waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas. The staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes. The assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them. Don't go here. There's plenty of other places to go around here., 0

Don't come here. First of all their limo drivers rip you off. They lure you into their limo and tell you it is free. And when you get there they charge you $80. The driver took $20 off the bat from one guy in our party and then suddenly he said we have to pay $80. He took an additional $80 and didn't account for the $20 her pocketed in the first place plus he was tipped another $10 on top. He jyped us a total of $100 for a limo ride. And then we were told for a party of 12 or more our cover is supposed to be comped but instead they tell us it is $30/person cover. Wow. Lure us here telling us everything is free and then tell us we have to pay $3000 for bottle service in order for us to get in for free. Wow! Don't come here. They just trick you into your money!!!, 0

We recently were going to eat in this restaurant but first wanted to try their advertised Happy Hour.  They advertise 2 for one drinks and on Friday only they advertise Complimentary Appetizers.  What a joke!  Now the happy hour starts at 5:00 p.m.  We got there are at 5:30 p.m. We found out that there are only a list of about 6 drinks that you can order for the 2 for 1.  No wine or beer included in 2 for 1 special.  So, 0

I would never recommend this complex to anyone. As the previous yelper pointed put the cars here get vandalized A LOT! Not only that but management changes every six months and each one wants to clean up the complex differently. We had cute little curtains on our patio and they were fine for 4 months until it randomly rained and made them look weird. We had not had time to clean them yet and then were given a warning to take them down due to "community violation". When asked about it they said we could not use our beige curtains because the color was not approved (it was the exact same color as the outside buildings). I was pissed because two apartments down some tenant has a rainbow/flea market blanket hanging in lieu of cute curtains.   The place is never clean and arizonas swat and most wanted teams have been here more than I can count. Management does not give a crap about you and are willing to show it. It is not worth the 100 dollars less to live here. You will become frustrated and annoyed and hate life. The only person worth anything here is Ozzy the maintenance guy. He is pretty freaking awesome though sometimes forgetful., 0
I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.  For dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, 0
This place just closed!   Unreal. Always had a decent crowd. Looks like they up and left as all the tables and chairs and equipment and everything are still inside, 0
I went to this Pita J and sat at the bar.  I liked watching all of the cooks bust their butts to get the food out.  But the waiters...yelling at the cooks and not saying please and thank you!  Putting their fingers and hands in and on top of the food that they are going to serve to customers... The money tip goes to the hard working cooks and not the waiters.  Wont be going to this Pita J again...maybe one of the other Pita J's will have a better attitude towards their cooks., 0

Ordered two medium pizzas for delivery and was told they would be delivered in about an hour. We called after 1 hour and 10 minutes and were told the driver had just left with the order. Called again at around 1 hr and 45 minutes in, 0
I was looking forward to coming to this place as it is very close to where I live and we are always looking for a new place to try. The parking lot looked busy but we decided to give it a try and hope that we would get a good breakfast before we started our errands.  WRONG!  We actually didn't even order.  We walked in and instantly noticed how outdated the place was but we were willing to still give it a try.  We stood at the front door, 0
I initially gave this salon a good review...and after coming back a handful of times, 0
I was very disappointed....rude employees pushed service away.  I had prepared an anniversary date for my husband and I. I had called in asking if I needed to make an appt. or reservation and they told me no just come in, 0
Waited for a table about 25-30 minutes but it was understandable becuase this place was packed.  We actually walked down to the Hard Rock instead but they stopped serving breakfast 2 minutes before we came in.  I hate when places do that.  If they were smart they could prob take a lot of Dennys' crowd.  Anyways back at Dennys.............Do not let them seat you next to the front pay counter.  Thats where we were and people were lined up inches away from our table with their butts closer than desired.  The waitress was trying really hard but if the kitchen staff is blowing it the waitress suffers.  They told us that they didnt have a kids menus but come to find out what they really meant was that they had no more kids menus.  Would have been nice to know seeing as how my two year old would have wasted a regular portion.  A bit scandalous I think.  We ordered and 45 minutes later (literally 45 minutes) we got our food.  My eggs oredered over easy might as well have been hard boiled eggs cut in half.  My hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and raw pots on the inside.  My gf found a hair on her sausage!  I brought the attention to the waitress when she passed by our table and she offered to have the things remade.  I didnt feel like waiting another 45 minutes and said I just wanted it taken off the bill seeing as how I didnt eat any of it.  She copped a bit of an attitude.    Bad experience but places like this and Shari's are really hit-or-miss.  It really depends on whos working up front and in the back.   Pretty much everything in Vegas food wise is pretty expensive but at least the service and quaity is there for the most part when your paying top dollar., 0

I waiting on my two person order for 50 minutes after being quoted a 12 minute wait and the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  The guy next to me waited 45 minutes for a single order of HUMMUS.  I was on a tight schedule and the staff was rude.  Multiple people were waiting on orders and were getting mad.  Refunds were not being offered.  Ultimately the food was pretty good so I am reluctantly awarding 2 stars, 0

I ordered the Chicken Milanese salad. Half the items mentioned as the ingredients were either not there or just barely there. Service was good. Bread served tasted great until the second round when it came to the table partially frozen/ cold. My daughter ordered the ravioli and there was only 5 of them. The place is overpriced and over rated. Not enough on your order to fill a normal person., 0
The Worst Business Practices that make one wonder how this merchant stays in business. Purchased a Groupon deal.  Called several times to schedule and no one answers the phone. Their Voicemail box is always full - unable to leave message. The owner calls back at will anytime/anyday - so most likely one misses the call and can never schedule. When i finally connected and mentioned i wanted to use a Groupon I was told he was booked solid for weeks. When I mentioned how difficult it was to connec to schedule he said I was not going to get a massage there and to get my money back from Groupon.  And then I wrote this post about my experience.  Without a doubt, 0
I do not know how this place is one of the highest rated places in LV. The sandwich is small and can no way be fresh like they claim it is. Do not waste your time in their 20-30 minute line. Marginal at best., 0

I hope I could give ZERO star!! The service is horrible. My friends and I have a flight to catch so we were sit on the bar to avoid the 45 min wait. We got the menu and everything and were excited about the food. Then the manager came to us and kicked us out. He said there was no server to serve us at the bar. Why would they seat us in the first place and then kick us out?! The service management is truly horrible. Which business does that???, 0

We fell for purchasing some meat from Round Up Meat company thinking it was a legitimate company like Omaha Steak company or Swansons.

I was extremely disappointed in this buffet. I had read such great things about it and heard how it was one of the best in Las Vegas... well I can't even imagine what the worst buffet in Las Vegas looks like then.  The price isn't even what got me riled up, 0
Meh - not my crowd at all.  The much younger group in the corner was super snotty and mouthy regarding my group of older coworkers (30s - 40s) as they gave us the hairy eyeball when we dared to come in and take the tables near them.  We were just looking for somewhere mellow to grab a bite and have a few drinks, 0
I came here with really high hopes because my wife and daughter came in and ate here on their last trip to las vegas (were from California). We arrived to a sizable line but got seated in maybe 10 mins top. The food is pretty good and prices are dirt cheap! 3 people can eat for under $25. I would have given them 4 stars but the service was complete shit! Our waiter came once to us and it was to give us our food. I was dying of thirst as well as my daughter.  We never had the chance to ask for other items we needed such as ketchup, 0

I kind of think this place is highly overrated.  It pisses me off because coming from Jersey this place is kind of weak.  Like others have stated the service is very slow and everytime I order hard Salami it is this little thinly sliced salami and I have never had it in any other Italian deli.  Not so good.  They do however sell jars of Centos products and I love the olive oil, 0
I generally will not write a review but when it comes to this time around I feel compelled to. I went to Riazzi's last night because my mother was in town and wanted a nice dinner and my wife and I suggested Riazzi's my wife has been coming here for years with her family (her parents even have had big anniversary dinners here) it was only my second time. Well the service to start with was OK not great not bad just OK the salads were ehh way to much vinegar in the dressing then we got our entrees I got Gnocchi which was a childhood favorite of mine (Grandpa amazing cook) and my wife got the Lasagna my first bite of mine all I could taste was salt just heavy salt in the sauce and my wife could not stand her dish either she couldn't put a finger on why just did not enjoy and only ate half. Well I did get through my meal I was hungry the waiter was nowhere to be found to share any displeasure well about fifteen minutes after all of us were done a bus boy took our dishes and we had asked for the check well twenty minutes passed and we finally saw our waiter and reiterated we had asked for check some time ago he just turned around to retrieve it no apology just handed it over and took credit card. My wife and I discussed on way home that this place was going down hill and would not go to again we even suggested this could be a candidate for a kitchen nightmare episode, 0
Horrible!  Ramblings of an old man. The show put us to sleep! The past two vegas shows have been a complete rip off with the host even telling the audience "ha ha got your money now sit in detention".  No more pride., 0
Horrible! Cart only came once. Our waitress left us. And there was only 1 other table besides us in the restaurant. We left and went next door to hot n juicy lol go to orchids!, 0

I don't normally expect good service from a chinese retaurant unless you're at a chained restaurant like P.F. Chang's. But this place is the worst both food and service. The younger gentleman with glasses at the counter is really rude. I was recommended to this place by a friend who said it's the best Chinese go to for him since he always do a take out order. Recently a young gentleman at the register screwed up his order as well.   Funny story was, 0

Nothing encourages me to come back here really. There are some modern racing games but I did not find the variety impressive otherwise. I found myself (as well as my bf) just wandering around unimpressed. At least the layout is pretty big but I'd rather walk over and enjoy a pretzel and beer. If you're of age and can live without playing racing games (as I can) or don't have those rare skills to win iPods, 0

OK so my boyfriend and I went through the drivethru. First problem: they were out of cream cheese rangoons. I could have brushed that off with no problem if that was the only problem. My bill was $11.10. I had $10.10 in cash and I told them to put $1 on my debit card. The lady screwed up and put $10.10 on my card and $1 in cash. They then told me they were going to give me a refund and try again. That didn't happen. I've worked in fast food and refunds are very easy to do. They gave me a dollar back and then tried to tell me that they gave me a ten. The manager came up and showed me two receipts trying to say that she refunded me. When a refund is processed, 0

I seriously cannot recommend the food served here. I was enticed to eat at this new downtown location because I had been so impressed with the french fries served at their south Phoenix restaurant.  The fries served here were terrible. My dining partner commented on how soggy and unappetizing they were and took them back to only have them replaced with equally depressing pile of soggy, 0

Have been going to this place for about 2 years because it was close by and had decent food.  The wait staff has always been extremely great and very pleasant.  Unfortunately I will never go to this place ever again and will tell everyone I know to do the same.  Their food has gotten extremely bad...too much salt on the all breakfast food and everything else is not cooked properly.  They just put out a new menu and raised their prices by over a dollar.  Pretty sure he did that because of his other failed businesses...a mortgage company that tanked along with other real estate investments.  They don't take reservations...or I was told that when I called to make some.  So we showed up an hour early to get a good seat for the football game.  I sat at a table and then I was told to move because someone had reservations.  So we moved to another table.  Then at this table we were told to move again because of reservations.  Then we finally got a table in their back room.  So we were all watching the football games and enjoying our overpriced food and watered down drinks.  Then with about 5 minutes left to go in the game we were told that we had to leave because someone else had reservations at our table and the Owner and Manager didn't even have the guts to tell us this themselves.  They made a tiny 19yr old girl come up to 10 guys to tell them to move.  She started to cry because she felt so bad to tell us and still no help from management.  Completely classless establishment.  We offered to share our table but they wanted us to move somewhere else entirely.  If that wasn't enough, 0

The rubber floor mats in my FJ are hooked into a c-hook to maintain placement. The brainiac who cleaned my car ripped the mounts out of the floor to remove and clean them. It's pretty obvious how to remove them without DESTROYING the mounts so needless to say I'm not pleased with this service, 0

I wish I could give a more detailed review concerning the food but we couldn't even get pass the bad hostess in the front to get into the place...I'm a local vegas "foodie" and decided to try this place on a Monday night around 630pm figuring it shouldn't be too busy and when my gf and I looked around the restaurant was half empty including the tables in front by the bar...as soon as I asked the hostess if we could sit she said it would be a 45 min wait so when I asked if we could sit at the bar and wait she said that area was reserved also...so I stayed polite and gave her my name and number and sat in front by the slots and watched as she let others in...after twenty minutes of watching this we felt insulted and left the casino and ate at a local Thai place with way better service...and not surprisingly the hostess at Gordon who I gave my number to never called me the whole night...so I'm going to make it a point to not recommend this place to all my local foodie friends and make sure none of Gordon's restaurants get a penny from me ever..thanks Gordon Ramsey for the worst front service I've ever experienced here in vegas!, 0

My husband also ordered the teriyaki chicken. He was very disappointed. Not that much chicken. Everything was filled with vegetables on the bottom. And a couple pieces of chicken on top., 0
food was great but they overcharged me for the bill.  Thought I was paying half what I was charged., 0
This is probably the worst McDonald's in the east valley. They close the play area early (7:00 sometimes). They ignore you when you're standing at the register. A simple "be right with you" would be a god send. A smile from an employee would be earth shattering. It feels like purgatory for these people. I feel like I'm bothering them just ordering something. I've read other reviews about the morning/day time shift so this only applies to the evening. It's often a bit dirty to boot. Unfortunately my kids love the ice cream and play area (when open) so I keep going back. Eventually they'll grow up and I went have to go., 0
Worst food I have ever tasted in my life. I went with my husband yesterday around 8.45pm. We ordered Ethiopian food. Sumbusa for appetiser and shared a vegetarian combination platter. The Sambusa was tasting ok. The five Vegetarian dishes we ordered were bland and was tasting similar (Shiro, 0
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! at the register a guest asked to exchange his order. He was told once the order is out they don't take it back.  When our order came the chicken Katsu was obviously burnt hence the darkness of the coating. When my daughter-in-law took it back they told her "it's because of the oil" she ask for a refund they offered her to exchange. She declined. The cook remembered her when she returned a plate of chicken katsu that was still pink inside. Proceeded to tell the cashier if they  refund her she will no longer be serviced there.  Once I ordered a dish when it came I advised the cashier it wasn't what I ordered and she stood there disagreeing with me. She wouldn't correct my order. Very sad customer service., 0
Bad pricey food. Had wings and fries and a tea. Ended up spending $25. The wings were gross and the fries were really below average.  I would have given 2 stars if I had paid $15 but even then the food would just not be close to what I'd expect from a restaurant serving wings and fries.   The service is good but that doesn't make up for the bad quality of the food., 0

Worst service ever. Irresponsible.  I lost a package that was full of my cloths and art supplies with their service. They never told me that one of my package was missing before i ask for it. They just delivered rest of two boxes. i spent two weeks trying to contact them and trying to figure why my package is in transit for three weeks. They answered extremely late and never knew where the package was or about any of process that it had gone through.

Unbelievably unorganized for such a new and hyped up hotel. The place is extremely big and there were no easy directions to our room. There are conflicting signs throughout sending us in different directions. When we finally got to our room all 3 room cards weren't working so immediately sent us back down to the front desk to straighten it out as no one answered the phone.  Billing was a hassle. We were 2 separate groups yet somehow the cost of both rooms ended up attached to one credit card. Should have been a simple fix yet took 45 minutes to check out because of this.  The place is too big for its own good. The food court that has the less expensive shops are about a mile away from the Venetian. Cant eat 5 star every meal nor did we want to. After trying to find it on the map and walking forever we gave up starving and ate whatever was in front of us.   Staff was friendly but place is unorganized., 0
My doctor had just retired and I had little choice but to visit a "doc in a box" for an infected toe and this was close to work.  There wasn't even a doctor on the premises in the middle of the afternoon on a week day.  I was seen by a physician's assistance who barely even looked at my toe, 0

Tiny little narrow shop. I had my girls with me.....sign on the front door saying "please hold children's hands".  Code for "we don't like kids".  We circled the store then left. Nothing that I couldn't live without so we left. So I guess this review is based solely on atmosphere., 0
Staying at the LVH is probably the most frustrating hotel experience I've ever had. They do not provide the bare minimum that you could expect from a given holiday inn. I even asked the concierge for qtips and they acted like it was a ridiculous request and tried to send me to the nearest pharmacy. It does not feel clean and is extremely out of date. This is especially frustrating if here on business. The one positive thing I must say is that the housekeeping and room service staff is very pleasant and accommodating., 0
SO OVERPRICED.  The only reason I even considered giving it two stars was because I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. However;  The base oil change was $40. NOT including oil, 0
I got a rib eye it was ok. The potatoes augratin was gross way too much onion. Service was friendly. The fries were horrible and the crab cakes seasoning wasn't good. The only thing I enjoyed was the bread basket. Way too pricey for the food being so bad. They really like to season there meat so if you don't like salty ask for none, 0
My mom sent me flowers for my birthday. The man who delivered them from this company was rude and very impersonal. I text my mom a photo and said thank you and she responses saying that wasn't what she ordered. While the flowers they delivered were in fine condition, 0

Had dinner with my wife here last week. Was very excited to try it.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.  We ordered raw oysters which were very small with no flavor and slightly fishy.  Then mussels which were very fishy.  Then escargot, 0
I've been here 4 times within the last year.  The "customer service" is atrocious - it's a bunch of high school kids with horrible attitudes that couldn't give a rat's ass as to what you receive or how you receive it.  Never mind the fact that you're paying a "premium" to shop at Michael's - you'll be treated as though you were buying food/custard from a subpar place.  The food is laughable.  Greasy, 0
I come to this Chipotle often, 0
ive been to better consignment places. however they are the only ones that would take some of my older clothes. they have a large selection which is nice but you really got to dig to find stuff. also i always consign like 10 things and only seem to get like $5 bucks in credit for nice stuff. it seems disorganized in there and can take awhile for them to sort through your things. also you can't call them to see if you have credit u have to go in-pain in the butt. i pretty much only go here if other stores won't take my stuff., 0
If all you want is pizza, 0
Expired food is my major concern with this store... It's either expired or less than 1 month away to expire. I love the friendliness of the staff but the quality is horrible., 0
Waited for 1 hr, 0
I understand that sometimes food doesn't come out as expected at times but even given this my family and I experienced  the worst pizza and or luck ever at the mellow mushroom. After a day of Xmas shopping we headed to the Mellow Mushroom. We have always heard good things about this place so we gave them a shot.  As we were seated everything started off great our server was nice and polite. We ordered a couple of hoagies and a large meaty meat pizza, 0

It's decent. Was much better last time I visited about 2-3 years back when I had to go to Jewish General. Service was okay but soup was a bit bland. Don't know what the hype about the spring rolls is. Maybe I'm just getting old., 0
This is an perfect example of a Pittsburgh restaurant-it sucks and people that live here don't know enough about what good food tastes like to realize that they are eating crap. Soggy and barely any veggies to speak of, 0
This is an Italian wannabe restaurant. If you're looking for true Italian food look elsewhere. Nothing bad per se, 0
My husband and I visited the Arizona Science Center two weeks ago on a Saturday to use a Groupon for the DaVinci exhibit. We like museums. So why only two stars?   Parking was confusing. Apparently you can get parking validated if you park in a specific lot, 0

Flew two days after Christmas and there was basically one security line that took an eternity to get through. Technically there were multiple lines but we were told that one was first class & priority (Checkpoint C) and the other (Checkpoint D) we couldn't use for some other reason and we were told to go down to Checkpoint E. I had arrived at the airport with two hours to spare and ended up running for my plane. I've flown out of Charlotte dozens of times but have never seen the staff as unprepared for holiday travel as this. At least they finally have short term parking again., 0
Originally I went here  as so many people here commented on how great the food was- so my expectations were high. However, 0
It's hit or miss with this company...but mostly miss! I have had a hard time getting the sizes I've ordered & they don't seem to want to remedy any situation when it's their fault., 0
I got the home security system installed.... which was expensive but at least i was to get 2 $100 gift certificates.  Well they use a 3rd party to manage those gift certificates who charge a shipping and handling fee in addition, 0
I decided to give these guys another chance and I'm sad to say that they have lost my business forever. I made an appointment online several days in advance for 12:00pm to have an alignment done. I drove all the way down there and the guy took all of my information and then when I said it was for an alignment he said they had no power and that they couldn't do it. Why wouldn't someone call me instead of making me drive  there?! Bad business. I decided to bring my car to Brake Masters instead and not only were they professional...they were $10 cheaper!, 0
The concept is great and the raw foods are very good.  But it all falls down with the service.  I've experienced long waits here., 0
Came here with my ladies (and gentlemen) and I think 5 of us opted for the pre fixe menu while Kristina ordered a la carte. I asked for the apple pie to go with the sorbet and molten lava cake. While everything was good, 0

Got a Groupon (2 for $36). There was heat-lamp  food. I thought both my kids would be kid price but my tiny daughter was charged $25 because she's 12. So that was $25 for a slice of rubbery pizza. She could have gotten the hamburger sitting under a heat lamp in water but declined. I thought the various flavors of cotton candy would atone for the lack of good kid food. I told them they could even get two, 0

It gets two stars for it's two stars.  1. The ridiculously great bread sticks and sweet cinnamon sticks. I will go back for these again alone if someone wants to go here.  They are light and tasty and could be sold by the dozen.  2. The great staff. We all thought that the lady who was helping us was not only adorably sweet but rocked her shape-ups well.   The pizza isn't anything special. The salad bar leaves much to be desired. I could see the location being a great hang out for a game with the open space and high top tables. It's on the brink of mom & pop meets college bar., 0

There pumps needs to be upgrade. When they rebranded from sunset/Decatur XP to Arco Am/Pm. They remodel everything except the pumps. The pumps are so old and haft of them don't have debit card swipe machine. But then there's some with a screen and some don't have a screen and just has the debit card swipe machine. The ones that has both the screen and debit card swipe machine. The screen then will display "the name of the card system on the pumps with needs upgraded to newest software". Usually Arco puts in new pumps before they open a new store. But they did t do anything with this station except some makeup and new signs/paint, 0

What can you say about a Asphalt Parking Lot with Elec.& Sewer & Water hook-ups. and Free Wi-Fi ? For $107.50 for two days. They could at least have cable TV. In a hotel for the same cost you get that. Also being @ Circus Circus they could offer a shuttle service to the Hotel & Casino. The KOA @ Boomtown, 0

Never staying here again. The Rehab pool party was going on while we were here and it was such a mess. Not my scene., 0
I like flavor and the carne asada had ZERO flavor. The restaurant is very nice and the spiked agua fresca was awesome. BUT the food has no flavor. Good for drinks not for food. Chips and salsa are ok., 0

It would be zero stars if there was an option.   I will ever visit this place again. It was not busy when we arrived but we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. That should have been my 1st clue to leave.    When we were finally seated the waitress appeared offering water we were already prepared to place our order from waiting so long.  She took our drinks order and about 15 min later the drinks arrived. My drink came in this Palm tree plastic cup hmm ok whatever it taste good so we placed our food orders and waited and waited about 30 min which would have been fine except when they brought the orders out it was the wrong items. I ordered the BLT wrap which was correct but my husband who is super sensitive with his food had ordered the carnitas plate. They bought him tacos. He is a diabetic and was very hungry and edgy at this point. We did not take the tacos the waitress said he ordered tacos my husband said no I ordered the carnitas plate. We said being the check.   Check arrived and they charged me $24 for my drink WHAT it was from the slush machine I was charged $11.25 for the plastic Palm tree cup I told her I didn't ask for the take home cup and didn't want it. She said you can just leave it then.     By this time I had it wrong food order waiting forever to be treated like this. Never again  I will be sure to share my review with others, 0

Wouldn't recommend the Suburban Pantry for breakfast.  Had traditional cooked breakfast with two slices of soggy toast balanced on the side of the breakfast plate.  Had to ask for a side plate, 0
Overall a pathetic and weak excuse for a Gyro.  The pita was slightly stale and chewy and there was so little meat here that it was lost in the pita, 0
I have going there for couple years and there is always new people and they are just slow. I don't have time to be sitting here for hours just for a pedicure. Plus I hate that they are close on Mondays and don't open until 10. This is a 24 hour town. Open at least at 9 am. Time to get to a new place, 0
Went to this last Wednesday. I thought it was a total waste of money. The dolphins are in small concrete pools and the few lions and tigers were in very small enclosures. Reminded me of the local backyard zoo. One of the tigers was pacing frantically from stress. Should be closed down for cruelty! Very disappointed in the Mirage and Siegfried and Roy for sponsoring this. These animals deserve better., 0
Open 24 hours including the pharmacy but if you have a choice go elsewhere-anywhere! I was in misery, 0

Terrible Terrible Terrible. 6 visits of the tech fiddling around with god knows what on my roof saying "it should be okay now" the cold I've had for the past two weeks because my apartment can't get above fifty degrees says otherwise. They NEVER apologized for giving me the royal run around, 0

I dined here for the first time on a  Friday night and have a mixed review to report. I guess I should preface this by saying it was their first night of their new menu and by this point in time they should have some of the "kinks" worked out. We did not know they had a new menu and not being entirely familiar with ceviche, 0
The Food and Service was HORRIBLE. The pepole sitting next to us found HAIR IN THEIR FOOD and we saw a cockroach on one of the tables! One of their dishes tasted so NASTY and SALTY.  When i asked them to take away the dish, 0
Worst car rental ever!! DO NOT RENT WITH THRIFTY! There is a reason they are called Thrifty and it is because they WILL rip you off!! I called to renew my rental and was told they could not find my agreement. During the same conversation I was told I would not pay any fee for turning my car in "LATE" since they could not find my agreement. ( the woman felt that maybe my rental was made under an incorrect name, 0
I came into this office tonight for an abscess tooth. I have had a few so I know the difference. The pain is unbearable and your gums form a pocket after you have had a cavity for some while.

Bar far the worst baja fresh is town. Small portions cold employees especially the Hispanic manager who had an attitude about giving me more thank 3 napkins. No wonder it was a ghost town in there at 3 pm on a monday. They need better staff, 0

I don't get it.  It's fine for what it is and the price is decent as well, 0
I cannot talk about their food because we left the restaurant after waiting 20 mins to get seated. We made a reservation and showed up on time. The waitress didn't bother to ask the name on which a reservation was made  and gave the  last available seat to somebody else who came to restaurant after us. All this while we were standing right there. I checked the list and sure enough their name/time was after ours. Also my living room bigger than this restaurant(no exaggeration), 0
Dear Carefree Station, 0
Dropped off laundry and dry cleaning:  25-30 pieces.  Had a great front desk service when I was there during the week; picked up my clothes on a Saturday and was met by the most unfriendly woman I have met in the service industry in some time. No "hello"  No "thanks for spending 125.00"...just a mean glare when I asked that she help me count the pieces to be certain it was all there...I asked if she was the owner and she said "nope" to which I replied "good thing since you are very unfriendly"....she could have cared less...my money will go elsewhere which is terrible since I live so close...their loss., 0

Not impressed. Service was poor. Food was slightly above average. Our entrees came out one at a time over a 10 minute period., 0
Hard to find for out-of-towners. It's across the street from Dominos on Green St.  Decently fast service - took just under 10 minutes to get 2 tacos and a deep fried quesadilla (say it like Napoleon Dynamite's grandma). The tacos are somewhat authentic w/ cilantro / lime / onion.  They put mayonnaise (interesting) on under the meat on the tortilla, 0
I am fed up with so many midwest restaurants calling themselves "Louisiana/New Orleans style" "Creole style" "Southern Style". It's no where near the real deal. It is a complete shame.   I dined here a few months back on a Saturday evening. It was pretty late and the restaurant was about to close in a hour or so. This could have been my fault for coming later in the evening when the kitchen was so close to shutting down and not providing good food. Still, 0

i came here to get a fill because my normal nail place wasnt open early enough on sundays and they opened at 10a (i had somewhere to be at 11a)  i called the night before to make an appointment and still had to wait when i got there because all of the employees were late except one. she rushed through my fill (who does a fill in 15 minutes?!)   she was also pretty insulting because she kept asking me if i wanted to get my eyebrows waxed while i was there. i kept telling her that i do them myself and i knew they needed to be done i just hadnt had time. i dont trust anybody with my face except me and i'm glad i didnt have her do them because she did a shitty ass job on my nails.  they were so bad i went to another place a week later and got a whole new full set.   dont go here., 0
I love this restaurant and have been coming here since its original opening. Today the service has been absolutely horrid. I had to ask to get a table cleaned. Ask for a menu. People seated near me are now eating. Had to ask the waiter to please take my order. Is anyone else experiencing these problems here? Worth waiting for the food as it was amazing. Never have seem my waiter again. Guess I'll go inside and ask for my check and tip myself for my hard work., 0
I was so disappointed with the quality... the salad was drenched in vinegar, 0
The customer service is horrible. Called them 5 times with 30 min waiting time each. The manager will HANG UP ON YOUR FACE!!!!!! All I need is just to send me the confirmation email. Poor service. Not recommended., 0

By far the worse food I ever had the displeasure of ordering and eating.  I think I should have just ordered the ice cubes and a napkin; those two items are the only things that even deserve a star on Yelp., 0
I am really hate to write a bad review but this one really got on my nerve.  So here is how it goes. - Atmosphere: Three stars. It is a okay atmosphere since they make it like a bar. - Food: Three stars. Nothing special. -Everything is okay to me. I order rice with the marinate beef. Not really a fan. I like the chicken wings though. - Clean: One star. The table are dirty even after the waitress wipe it off??? What??? I can still see the food the other customer left behind. - Service: Really bad service. We have to ask for everything. From utensils to sauce for the food. Sorry if I can give a negative star I would. - Price: Three stars. Okay price. I come on the first few days of the the discount week. The whole bill is only half price so it is cheap at that time. Total: Two star.  And here is how it get one star. Since I decide to give it a second try because all restaurant are busy on the first day, 0
I have been back a couple of time and really need to downgrade my original review.  The service has been sketchy at best, 0
This nightmare of an embarrassment of a dinner .. Not only doesn't serve the eggs Benedict but when I ordered the lobster omelet.. It arrived 37 minutes later (empty restaurant people! ) with no lobster ! ! ! I can't even imagine the mess this place is when it gets busy.. If it even does ..This place sucks. Might as well go to McDonald's  or starve .. Stomach acid is way better., 0
Is this place one of the few inexpensive buffet spots on the strip? Yes. Is the food comparable to other buffets on the strip? No. Why? Well, 0

When did they get rid of their stamp cards? I have been gone for far too long. That's not the only thing that has changed. I remember coming here often back in high school. Were my taste buds just off or have they changed? I had the honey lemon green tea with aloe vera about a month ago, 0
Bad service....everyone had their food and I waited 20 minutes and had to ask...I also said no cheese and they added cheese... The manager was hesitant and kind o rude at first, 0

We decided that we would take in another great breakfast this Saturday at Matt's.  The food again was awesome that is not my beef.  We arrived at 0600 and our course there was no one else there since they still didnt open until 0630.  The employees were busy getting ready for the day.  Meanwhile some other customers started showing up and it seemed that a few of them knew each other so they must be regulars there.    The door opened and 0630 and a young blond lady invited us in with the others that were waiting.  This is were it happened!   I walked in the door and chose a table to the right and was informed that "that table is set for three".   WTF??    We were the first people in the door and anyone who has ever eaten knows that it is open seating and if seats are not available then you put your name on a notebook sheet of paper by the door and wait.  So, 0
I've been to Harley's several times for brunch and enjoyed it several months ago (breakfast pizza with egg and bacon was amazing). They've recently (in the past couple of months switched to a "Buffet". The past 2 times I've gone it was really lacking. Food was cold, 0
I dont like to hit these guys with a one since Its been three hours and Im not ill like my last 1 rating but after asking for feedback it was agreed that was what they earned tonight. Here is why:  Im not a Sushi expert by any means but I do enjoy eating it and learning about new Sushi dishes. So when the GF and her daughter suggested it I agreed so we came here.  Upon sitting down we were greeted right away by the whole staff but that is where things went horribly wrong.  The server brought out our chop sticks and mixing bowls and we found a hair and some rice stuck to one dish.  I would normally walk out here but this is their favorite place so we stuck around. (No discount was offered for this but a very fast sorry about that was received)  We tried about 10 dishes and we were all disappointed that the rolls were all rice and filler with just the smallest hints of seafood. The fish wasn't the freshest but the flavor was good.   There was three people in our group and two other tables with one server and two chef's We each ordered a roll and they all came out separately. Since it was all you can eat and family style I can appreciate that but when the other two tables were being served new dishes before ours came out it seemed liked a very disorganized restaurant   When a set of rolls came out prepared different than how it was listed they explained it was a new chef and they would make us a new roll. Not wanting to waste anything we said thats ok.(this was another pluss for them)  Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the toilet in the mens bathroom. If you remember the Ferguson from the TV show "married with children" this is without a doubt based on that; for the business those toilets must see they must have some serious power just remember to stand before you flush or you may get sucked in. Its a serious vaawhooosh!!! And Al Bundy would be proud., 0
The quality of the food and the service has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY since the original owners sold the restaurant and moved back to Thailand. The new owners are stingy with their portions and the quality of the food sucks! I had been eating there for years but will never go back again. The service this last time was the worst I've ever seen. My server was extremely rude @ it was the owner! I'm done with this place forever!, 0
If I could rate this place 0 I would....watch every bite of your food closely you may find a little creature in your food...and they will do nothing about it except take your food back and not refund you and tell you to get lost...RUDEST PEOPLE EVER!!, 0
I would have liked to given this place a great review since it's so close to me.  I was really looking forward to taking a lot of people here.  But the gelato was soupy, 0
Food is not bad. Open late.  The staff aren't always nice - pesters you for the tip., 0
Horrible horrible horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes and were not greeted so we got up to leave and all they did was wave us goodbye, 0
Sat in a booth with my wife and my friend. We had a bartender with short blond hair take our order. We ordered drinks. Drinks did not come in a timely manner. She brought me my beer  but forgot to bring my buddies margarita and my wifes adult shake. It was about 945pm and the place was not busy. I watched her go to the corner of the bar and eat a burger. Our food comes and we tell the guy that we never got our remaining drinks after 20 minutes. He took care of us and got us our drinks. My buddy tasted his drink and didn't like it. The blond came up to us and said she had a rough day and that it was 110 degrees today and people were rude. She was totally not a friendly bartender. The food was good however we won't be going back., 0
Don't believe the hype. My chicken taco  was so dry that a knife couldn't even cut it. It's easy to tell that it was chicken reheated from the previous day, 0
I rate this a 1 star because of their crappy service.  45 min wait they said at the door for just me????  I walk through the restaurant to access the strip and I see table upon empty table.  Someone needs to fire a GM and hire some staff.  I hope to try the food one day, 0
Bad service and rigged video poker.  AVOID at all costs.  I love Vegas, 0
First let me start by saying Tammy is a horrible server, 0
My girlfriend and I recently had an late dinner here and it was terrible. We had to wait in line for 20 minutes with 2 people ahead of us. The service is really slow and the staff was not friendly.  We had the chicken wings and the Greek salad, 0

If this were the only Smith's in town it would be closed. The employees are lazy & rude and the place is always in a state of disarray. Like Sandi K said they have the entrance blocked up with sale items and of course the CASINO is right inside the door for the gamblers. We only shop here when other locations are out of SALE items and for some reason this loccation has an adequate supply., 0
Not a good vietnamese by any standard. The Vietnamese spring rolls (not fried) were mostly filled with vermicelli, 0
So sad that this place has gone downhill. We have loved this place since it's opening. However, 0
I've been here twice and neither time was good. The service is slow, 0
This is the worst air conditioning company ever. They've been to my house 6 times this summer and the problem is yet to be fixed. They are highly unprofessional. The service manager came out and openly expressed he did not have enough time to complete the repair. Instead of doing his job and fixing the problem, 0
Went by this shop yesterday on my way to the Sprint store, 0
Drove into this somewhat overwhelming place that does everything for your camper.  I have been to another one before and had such a great experience decided to cover all the things needed here.  Went in to ask about getting the things done that we needed done and was told go there and there and there.  Sounds fair.  The first there was in a different place than pointed too.  Then I was told the gas was outside and we will "get there when we can".  I get busy, 0
I used to love this place but I've had two bad visits in a row so I'm done. Yesterday 2 out of the 4 people at my table got the wrong starch, 0
DO NOT Do business with this company.  They are scammers and are not professional.  People need to be forewarned about this company.  In their website you will noticed that they don't have information as to their companies address etc.  This company is probably not a legitimate business.  I checked on the state of Nevada website and this company is not listed.  Shouldn't they have a bond or license number on their webpage?  Their BBB rating is F.  So please do not make the mistake that I made.  I will give this company a negative 10 star rating., 0
MEH.....stopped here after a night at dave & busters for dessert. They were still open for another 45min or so, 0
I would give it no stars if it was an option. Saw a roach on the wall and the guy at the register said "better on the wall". Food was ok, 0
Highlight of the night  *NO WAIT AND WALK RIGHT IN*  I gave one star for no waiting and one star for being spacy.   We came on friday night and it's typical Asian invasion. We walked in and the decoration was kinda interesting. Budda everywhere. Budda was never a decoration in chinese culture, 0
So this show has been running for 28 years and unfortunately it feels like it.   The queens I saw tonight, 0
Didnt make it to breakfast. Had pesto chicken sandwich. Had high expectations, 0
One star. Noise can be heard from the strip on the 28th floor. REALLY?!? woke up both nights multiple times to sirens, 0
Do not stay here!!!  Filthy!  Overpriced!  Had two hookers smoking the reefer and doin the do in the room next to us. So, 0
Youfit seemed like a great idea but like a previous reviewer said, 0
I've been to this venue several times because I travel and have quite a few friends who happen to be musicians. The security and staff are crazy, 0
We went to try to eat there tonite after we called.  We were told the wait time was 25 min but that was not the issue. We were not greeted at all and not even looked at!!! It us rare to encounter rude Thai folks because they are generally kind..., 0
We had dinner here tonight with visiting family. Needless to say, 0
If I could put 0 stars I would.  terrible service, 0
Went into this F&E this evening and a lady told a f&e employee that one of the meats packaged was very old. He just walked by her and said well don't buy it then. there were about 5 customers  and all of our mouths just dropped:0 The lady was very respectful at his comment and said that was a weird response. I said that was rude!  I think another customer went to report it to the manager. Smh!, 0
Rating is zero stars for the customer experience that I was given to me by the employees and even owner of the omelet house. I unfortunately had to experience hair in my food and when I brought it to the attention of the employees there was no apology or accountability. Then the owner came over and proceeded to tell me that " I enjoy the hell out of my meal and blamed me for having hair in my food" I was at this point insulted and made to feel as though my meal of $10.00 was more important than the overall customer experience. I will never eat there again. Needless to say this was the worst customer experience I have ever experience and after you read this you rethink if you time is worth being mistreaded by an owner who doesn't value his customers experience., 0
DO NOT go to this restaurant!!! There are plenty of BETTER restaurants in Vegas to go to. When you know you're going to spend a big chunk of change on a meal, 0
I went to this nail place for the first time today because someone bought me a gift card there. The location was good & the salon looked fair clean (although a bit run down) but the staff was not friendly & did a lazy job. I went for a pedicure &  tech was so annoyed at how short I had cut my toenails. Then when I wanted a bright pink french pedicure, 0
Only stopped in to try a macaron. No reason to go back. Waste of money, 0
Food was ok. It's more like appetizers priced at regular food item costs. The service was bad. The waiter never asked if we wanted anything to drink. We had to stand up and walk over to him to get a drink. My friend asked for a soda and they thought he asked for a salad. Food was enough as I don't eat much, 0
Ugh...I had never been to a Waffle House, 0
Okay it gets a star for the patio but that's about it.  The food is just ok.  The main reason I don't like this place though is due to my first experience here.  I was at a bachelorette party and I am not a big drinker so I only had a beer.  I watched as the waiter "bought" a round of shots of the girls.  They each had a mixed drink or two and they WAY overcharged the girls assuming they were too drunk to remember.  This has happened at another bachelorette party I went to as well. Maybe this is just an Arizona thing?  Every time the waiter "buys" rounds of shots and then charges the table.  Not to mention that the mixed drinks here are REALLY expensive.   If you are into the Mill crowd and you want a party I suppose this place works, 0
Horrible service  I would give it a zero if I could   had an appointment for 9a for both my wife and I, 0
Within a couple hours of checking in, 0
Service is SLOOOOOOW at best. Took ten (10!!) minutes to get a drink refill and our waitress only had three tables!! She also was uninterested in the customers and had zero personality (not a requirement for the job, 0
This place sucks.  Mr. Luckys 24/7 fusion cafe...Chinese and American to be exact.  Go serve yourself a burger and egg roll and wash it off with some bud light. Terrible combo.  Had the fried rice and spare rib thinking it was gonna be decent chinese food..EHHH!!!! Tasted more like Costco frozen fried rice, 0
The office staff was overly unconcerned about clients. Not a smile or hello did i see or hear!  I shouldve left at that moment cause it only got worse., 0
I am giving this store 2 stars based on Customer Service alone. The front desk is located right in front of the entrance. The day I walked in, 0
So I'm a California native use to malls being big, 0
Don't plan to go here if it's anywhere near closing time.  They are open until 10pm and when I called at 9:30pm I was told by the receptionist Rebecca that if I arrived prior to 10pm and was signed in...my child would be seen by a doctor.   We arrived at 9:55pm and she told me that since 2 other people arrived just before me, 0
Only if there was a 0/5 stars.   Food: worst sushi place I've ever been too and I eat a lot of sushi. The sushi at this place taste like plastic and the portions suck. Its like 70% rice and 30% sushi and we all know the crab meat is imitation, 0
I'm really not a fan of this place an quite frankly I never have been. The entire ordering system is completely screwed up. You walk up and order and then you are supposed to stand there and wait for them to cook your burger, 0
Let me start out by saying their food was decent. I had the sweet and sour chicken and I thought it was pretty good but nothing special.   The reason for the 2 star review is their customer service. The other day I came into Flo's with 3 of my co-workers. We were greeted by a very kind hostess and immediately seated. We sat down and waited all of 30 seconds before our waiter came over and took our drink orders. He must have run to the kitchen and back because next thing we know, 0
I would give negative 10 stars if I could, 0
I did not stay here but went to visit out of town friends who stayed here.  The hotel was definitely not designed for anyone with any type of mobility issue - steps everywhere!  Steps to get ice.  Steps to get to the pool area.  Steps to get to the lobby.  Can you find a way around some of these steps?  Sure - if you don't mind going into the parking lot and circling around the building while cars drive past you.  The rooms seem nice but there is no way on earth I will EVER stay here.  This hotel doesn't seem to have any concern for the disabled whatsoever., 0
Everything up to the point of my wedding went well.... the ladies are very on top of the whole ordering process and very nice to deal with. I wouldn't have even written a review except I feel like they could have been a little more apologetic  about delivering my wedding cupcakes late to my reception. I had all my guests sitting watching the assembly of my cupcake tower when they were to be delivered an hour before the reception was set to start. Then I get an email notifying me that I was late making final payment but since they neglected to call me to ask for payment they were going to wave any and all late charges.... Um, 0
Overall experience is VERY bad.  Use at your own risk!, 0
I really wanted to give 1 star, 0
I am definitely not a fan of this casino.  Yes it is nice to look at from the outside, 0
the folks at my work would order this food quite often.  This doesn't say much  considering my coworkers love for strange underwhelming establishments.  You could fry a roach, 0
I really don't have a review about the show because few days before I was suppose to attend the show it was cancelled. I am disappointed because I saved money for a year to see her. I was not able to cancel my airline ticket or hotel. I am so disappointed because I am going to Las Vegas for no reason. I should be reimbursed for hotel and airline ticket. I know I won't be able to see her in person again. It took me along to save this amount of money. I am really hurt that I couldn't see the concert and never will again., 0
Very difficult to return defective products here.  We purchased a 32" Samsung TV the previous day. After assembling it and turning it on we noticed it was defective in the following ways:  the set leaned to the left, 0
Bally's is one of the cheaper hotels on the strip and you get what you pay for. The location of this hotel is awesome but the rooms need some serious updating. I felt kind of dirty staying here. Look at all your options before booking a room here., 0
They only get 2 stars for the food, 0
Sushi fell apart, 0
I'm an Enterprise Plus member...and typically I love renting from them. However this experience was much less than good.  I rented from the Las Vegas airport location. The counter staff downstairs was exceptional!  Thank You.  It was when I went upstairs, 0
The positives?  The easy to look at hostesses/waitresses and lavish las vegas styling.  The negatives? This place is a misleading and stupid.    We were reeled in because it was "Happy Hour" & the hostess said appetizers are half price and the drink specials are two for one draft beers or 2 for 1 stoli or patron.  So, 0
Loved this place when it first opened. What happened?  Changed the menu so they don't offer sandwiches at dinner. Bootlegger burger now has a thick slice of uncooked bacon on it. Kale salad left in big chunks where it used to be julienned. Disappointing. Drink prices have always been too high but I could overlook that for a great place to hangout in the neighborhood. Now I am wondering whether it is worth it to go here when there are better places down the freeway., 0
Crap. Bud Light, 0
I kind of have a love hate relationship with US Airways. I have always found their staff to be extremely kind and helpful. I especially appreciate how patient they have been with me the many times I have found myself running late, 0
Ate here for dinner ordered Thai egg roll the calamari and pad kee mow . Egg roll and squid awesome ordered the pad kea mow at a 3 but came at a 8 easy too hot called the owner over and tried to explain and he started to yell at me grabbed my plate and in front of a crowd to me to get the F out of there. I will go to the corner Thai kitchen at trop. And tee pee., 0
I pass this place on the way to work and wanted to give it a try. I walked in to a small crowded room with no seating available. With no one at the counter I looked over the menu. I went with the special, 0
First time eating here.  Burger was fairly good, 0
No only have we waited 8 min for someone to come over and take our drink order.  She tried to tell us we can only have the appetizers in the bar!!!!! WTF GET YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!!, 0
I want to like this place - I really, 0
I have brought my 3 cars to be washed here in the last 5 months and even though the wash wasn't great it's pretty much the only place in town I would keep going back.  But after today no more.  So I come and of course they are always trying to upsell, 0
The service was poor we had to ask for refills, 0
Came to Gallagher's Steakhouse for dinner with my friends while I was here in Las Vegas.  Gallagher's Steakhouse is the high end steakhouse for New York New York Hotel.  The d\u00e9cor here has that feel of an upscale NY dinning establishment.  It's a nice high end feel but comes at a price of that they really pack you so that you're really close to your neighbors and that the acoustics of this Gallagher's is lousy so you have to really speak up in order to talk to the people across from you.  They had our reservations and was able to show us our seats within minutes of arriving.  The menu here is pretty basic and what you would expect from a steakhouse, 0
Went to Carlos 'n Charlies for Friday night drinks before going out. The patio was PACKED to capacity (probably 300-400 people) and the bar was staffed with TWO bartenders. Friends of mine waited 50 minutes to get service, 0
The worst place I have ever stayed. It's better to spend a bit more for much better quality. The security is lame. The won't do anything if you've been robbed. They will literally shrug and ignore you. They will also screw up the rooms you reserved cuz they can't do their damn job and when they finally get it right, 0
the burgers were adequate. i'm undecided about this place since i just moved here. as far as impressions go, 0
This is pretty much my worst nightmare: a giant restaurant with multiple bars that serves huge-ass margaritas and plays Jimmy Buffet music and videos NON-STOP.   Needless to say, 0
Worst experience of my life.   From the moment Dr. Schneider walked in to do my root canal I wished I would have never stepped foot in this office.   Walking in and acting like king of the world, 0
Stay clear of this place - mixed up orders - unprofessional - bad customer service.  Don't bother calling in an order because when you arrive it will not be ready.  Even when the staff admits the error nothing is done to better the situation - discount or attempt to get you to return as a customer.    Stay clear - you have been warned, 0
Weder gut, 0
Frozen margarita was sub-par, 0
So I get random take-out Chinese cravings every once and awhile and today was one of those days.Based on such positive reviews I was really excited to try my "usual" at a new place ...a good place. Unfortunately, 0
We decided to pop into the open kitchen for lunch.  Our server was very prompt in taking our order, 0
Not bad.    We moved to AZ from Bangkok and my wife is Thai and a superb cook to boot, 0
This place is a joke. I generally change my own oil but have been busy with work and my son. I stop by today and one of the kids flags me in. Next the 2 young men approach my car to let me know that they can't service my car because they are out of oil filters. Doors are open, 0
I will have a spicy tuna roll with a side of racism. My family and I went to Sushi Tachi a few months ago and it has taken me this long to calm the rage from the experience to write my review.  One evening my husband, 0

This place was horrible ond overpriced.  Save yourself $40 and go to McDonald's., 0
I'm 100% sure I won't return and it's not because of the location or the wine/food.    Some friends and I decided to do a wine tasting and they provided some cheese, 0
** Update 4/12/08**  The reason I moved my star rating down to 2 is because the food is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! And I left it at a 2 rating because the bar is actually nice for cocktails ONLY!  I took my friends there for some beers and food and thought it would be fun because they are in town from England....Since when are fish and chips that are supposed to be "beer battered" cooked with Italian bread crumbs?????  The chips where regular french fries!, 0

Why no power for recharging?  You gotta get with the times and add power. Every seat needs a plug. EVERY. People sitting on the floor along walls is super lame. And it's about 82 degrees in here. Have you not heard of AC? Get with it Vegas Airport., 0

I had a battery under warranty (otherwise I would have went to Costco) and got a new battery that died after 1.5 years.  They did a free install and everything was good.   I drove into work today and went to lock my power locks and car was dead.  Turned out the negative cable wasn't tightened enough so wasn't getting the power it needed.  Luckily I had a wrench in my car so I was able to tighten it and everything appears good now.  I wouldn't trust any of these chain car shops to any repair except under extreme emergency, 0
The absolute worst place I have ever done business with! To start off with the lady I talked to on the phone didn't even know how to give me directions to their location or didn't even know what corner they were located on only knew they were near Trader Joes then when I finally got there the process seems simple then I left with my rental car I least my car on a Thursday and paid for one week and my rental car was given to me dirty I've been received a phone call from a girl in their office asking for a different person not even myself and I asked the girl if she was looking for me she said no then I get numerous phone calls from a blocked number then finally they told me it was a vis rent a car and that my rental was up on a Wednesday which would only be 6 days not 7 then the kid on the phone told me I was wrong and I was an idiot so we exchange words on the phone I was told to bring down the vehicle which I did then when I got there to return the vehicle they were very rude customer service was very bad and didn't even I know how to work the computers I was there for about 45 minutes trying to return the vehicle this is the absolute worst place to lease a vehicle I would not recommend this business to anybody stay far far away from this business!!!!!!!!!, 0
the WORST MEAL EVER! btw, 0
Mediocre food & terrible service.  Got 2 stars cuz they offer lunch specials 7 days per week & innovative dinner specials which are modeled after the lunch specials., 0
customers be ware! They did an oil change on my car a 2006 Hummer, 0
I wish I could give even lower. I am an African American female who just wanted a fade. I walked in and no one acknowledged that I entered the door. Of course all the young girls who may not be that experienced with my hair type delayed enough to ensure the only African American would get me. Well they probably could have done a better job and been more professional. After being patient and watching her watch tv, 0
Very very disappointed with the total lack of customer service this Company and store provides! We purchased the "happens"service plan for our cell phone. We purchased the plan from Aaron and Tom.  They both told it was great service and told us we would get % retail trade in value for phone if we chose to upgrade our phone.  We paid 9.99 a month for 8 months and came to store to try the upgrade.  First off, 0
Service mediocre, 0
I'm only giving them one star because you can't give zero(or maybe I don't know how to). I'm currently renting a condo from a realty company.  The ac started leaking water from where the filter is, 0
We ate here today for lunch.  Although the food and service is good, 0
I have been going to Big-O-Tires for the past 4 years at various locations and this one for the past year. I am honestly not seeing why everyone is so impressed this this location on Bell. I really like the Tempe location and find their mechanics to be better and more honest.   1st off, 0
Too far off the strip, 0
My daughters had a "sisters night out" and showed up for Hip Hop Night 7/18/14. They were told (after they had been there for 2 hours) that glow in the dark skating was going to begin and they could not skate without purchasing something that glows (such as a necklace).  This should have been listed on their website!!!  What a scam, 0
Huge disappointment.   -Service was realllllly slow. Overall it was a 1.5 hour breakfast for 2 people once we were seated. We waited over 15 minutes my credit card back after giving it to the waitress and eventually went inside to find it. I think this is partly due to being understaffed.   -We sat outside and they leave their maple syrup on the tables. Bees were EVERYWHERE. The hostesses were swatting them and spraying them with whatever they clean the tables with.  -The biscuits are terrible. I would think if you have "biscuit" in your name and they are included with every meal they would be decent. They are dry and flour-y with sugar sprinkled on top. Any fast food restaurant has better biscuits.  The blueberry pancakes were pretty good as were the grits, 0
This is my 3rd time here and the WiFi is horrible!  What a waste of time, 0
I took my truck in for a turn signal and a key replacement on the 23rd of August.  They didnt have the parts and said they would order them and schedule the appointment once they came in.  I called them back twice, 0
Curious to where they moved to? Just spend a lot of money on a 6 month package a week before they moved and have no idea to when they will be up and running or where they re located??? Would have been nice to know they were moving when i signed up. Tanning season is here and I cant do anything about it., 0
This place is just sad! The employees are too lazy to let you meet any of the animals. These kind of businesses should be shunned and shamed for their practices. How can we as a society allowed businesses like this to survive?, 0
I've eaten here about 12 times over the past few months. Fairly inexpensive Asian food with the only bubble tea available on the west side of Madison make it appealing. A few dishes have been great, 0
Camden Canyon apartments are very nice inside. I lived in a two bedroom apartment with a roommate for just under a year, 0
Im sorry to say that I did not have a great experience here.  I really wanted to like this place, 0
This visit was awful here. The employee who didn't have a badge but was Asian screwed up the entire order. Was charged for guacamole which I didn't get the bowls were made wrong and the line was out the door. Customer service was awful. My chips and salsa was no there. Talk about a nightmare this is the worst location I've ever been to. I understand it's fast food but really I've had better service at food truck then this awful location., 0
2.5 stars...  Really?! I was not impressed. The ambiance and decorations here = modern, 0
ugh... never again... the DJ was horrible.. he would put one upbeat song, 0
Worst buffalo ever. The manager is a complete dick. On a college football Saturday in the middle of important games he turned all the tvs to a UFC fight and told us that it didn't matter what we were there to see that is what was going to be on. How can you run a restaurant with absolutely no customer service? we all walked out without paying, 0
Not a fan!  They were good when they were on State Street, 0
I browsed through this store with my girlfriend. There were two employees working, 0
Would be good if they would fill your drinks. Or bring your food after 30min. Terrible service!!!!!, 0
This is a general overview of our experience with Tire Works.  We had a flat tire in the airport parking after getting back from a week long trip.  We brought the car into tire works and they filled the tire with Nitrogen.  They mentioned that the tire had been checked for any issues or punctures.  Of course, 0
I had heard abt there so called BLIZZARD but was very disappointed with the taste or   Flavor or I would say was that an nice cream, 0
My wife and I took her aunt here for breakfast. When our order was brought out everything looked good. It was not until I cut into my omelet that we realized that was not the case. Raw egg oozed out all over the plate. I waited for a while for the wait staff to return and had to go bring one back to the table. They were not understaffed or busy. I think they had 12 staff members and 4 tables of people including ours. When they returned with my corrected order, 0
The second star us just cause it's mostly clean.  No one behind the counter has a clue. I asked if they had any pies besides apple. She said cherry, 0
Yikes. An atrocious sports bar with 3, 0
Agree with the reviews about service. Our order took over 20 minutes and it wasn't even busy at all. Many people who came in after us all got their orders before us. Then to add insult to injury they put the mayo on the sandwich which we had asked to be left off so we had to wait for it to be redone. The french fries were also cold when they arrived. The manager came out and apologized and comped the one sandwich but it was still an unpleasant experience. Food was just so so. Then while we are eating our sandwich outside these two really nasty looking pigeons are going to town on the food left on the tables. It was so disgusting they were on the plates and bowls I went inside to suggest they clear out the tables. After a few minutes someone came out to finally clear the tables and shooed away the pigeons which then flew right over another diners table while they were eating. Thank goodness it wasn't ours! The fellow dining patron and I both mentioned we hope they have good dishwashers!! Anyway I must leave this place as the pigeons are going after another table and I can't take it anymore. Please if you are going to have outside dining clear the plates often!, 0
I was looking forward to trying thus place out, 0
This place was awful. I don't know why we stayed. But we had to wait to be served for an hour. Also, 0
Absolutely the worst customer service I have EVER SEEN! I am 33 years old, 0
As a fan of the restaurant it hurts me to say I am not so impressed with the truck. It really hurts. We were visiting the Monkland street fest and saw that a few trucks were staking claim on the street during the event and one of our first stops was the Lucille's truck since we've been frequenting their brick and mortar for the past few weeks.   We ordered a lobster roll, 0
There should be a rating for criminal activity, 0
I drove to vegas may 6th, 0
I found the food to be EXTREMELY crunchy but tasteful. I ordered a fish. An orange one. Also, 0

GOLD in RUDENESS. it was my first time and only time going to this location. Whole staff was very rude, 0
I moved all the way up to 2 stars because of the outside patio, 0
Soup  and chili were adequate for upper Midwest pretensions to Mexican food. Those who ordered the tacos plates seemed to enjoy them.  The sliders (from the bar menu), 0
You didn't offer a Zero. This place has good food but is overpriced and the music they pipe in that prohibits conversation should get someone an opportunity in another industry., 0
Hmm.. seeing all the reviews on so-called dive bars in Phoenix made me remember Kay's Place -- the diviest of all dive bars I've ever entered. As in, 0

Wasn't a big fan of this place.the crab legs are served cold the gumbo wasn't very good, 0
I did not like this place at all. First of all, 0
I have no idea why this place is so famous. I eat sushi almost every week, 0
Let me start by saying I like their boba. But the services are to be desirable.   I ordered a few drinks with coffee jellies.  Ordered One drink with coffee jelly and boba. When my drinks came out, 0
Ok so first impressions are everything right, 0
All I can say about this place is SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Our service was slow and it wasnt even full. The food was cold and tasted old. The best thing I had here was my drink and buffalo wings. Let's just say I will NOT be returning here., 0
I really love their juices here but their customer service makes you not want to ever come back.  All 3 times I've been here the teenage girls act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.  Usually takes 10+ minutes to get anything even if there is nobody else here.  They are just busy in the back gossiping., 0
Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste., 0
We parked here and validated the ticket ourselves at the machine by the cashiers. When we left, 0
Not going back. It's the cleanliness of the place that still haunts me.   5/15/2010 i sat on the patio. When you enter there are 2 lamps on the brick wall outside..one is totally busted. There are 3 ceiling fans on the patio that do not work. (one didn't even have the hardware attached just dangling cords.) Instead there was a floor fan on the bar. There were FLIES everywhere!!! I had to sacrifice half a beer because one went in and drowned...i barely noticed this!!! Not one bit of this review has anything to do with food...but everything to do with maintenance and impression. The tables and chairs were just dirty. I enjoy sitting outside, 0

Can't say I'm impressed with the Cosmo food scene. There's better tapas at Firefly. The hidden pizza joint next door is a more satisfying meal.   The Cosmo better step it up food wise. It's highway robbery for very so-so quality food. They obviously want more of a vibe than a great place to eat. Great food gets return customers. Everyone on that 3rd floor are in for a surprise in a year from now...., 0
*sigh   Another place that used to be the best in town, 0
Ok sandwich but the portions are small and it's overpriced. I won't be back., 0

I heard such great things about this restaurant... I was totally looking forward to it.. The building and interior decor is totally outdated.. but then again who cares. Its about the food anyways.. I ordered the TORTELLINI BROCCOLI ALFREDO..... So SO gross. Tasted like something cheap out of a can.. I am not a picky eater at all whatsoever... and this was nasty...., 0
I received their flyer in the mail for them to install a WCC relay for our AC Units.  Our cost would be zero dollars because of the $80 rebate from NV Energy. Of course they tried to upsell into a maintenance package as well (which is understandable).  The appointment time was almost two weeks later to show up between 12-2 pm.  I finally received a call from dispatch at 4:45 on the appt day  that they need to re-schedule because the technician was sick. The dispatch supervisor (Angela?) wanted to reschedule nine days later.   Two questions she could not answer:  1: Why did I not get a call earlier since I had to wait at the house?  2: How can I be sure that you will show up on time for the next appt?  No apology was made. In a sarcastic undertone she made it sound like "you are getting this installation for free."  Does that mean that my time isn't valuable?

I just came back from the Las Vegas BB store on Maryland Parkway.  The store manager refused to sell me 15 laptops at regular price after we waited for an hour to try to get the order in.    This is how the sales process went:  we went to the front area and spoke with a lady in customer service.  She got a rep on the floor to help us, 0

I really loved this place when it opened and was happy to have a high quality sandwich and med place across the street. Unfortunately since originating management has left the place has rapidly gone down hill. My sandwiches are now about 1/2 the meat and less attention to quality as before and the prices have gone up. I sure they will make up in the transient crowds but its sad to see them squeeze every buck versus having consistency and quality. I just paid $7+ for a sandwich that should have cost about $4.50. I wish them luck, 0

Worst experience ever!!! Took 30 mins for 1/2 table to get drinks and then they messed up most of them. When we asked for a manager he was supposedly "behind the bar"...well if the manager is that slow behind the bar he should change jobs. Food was so so., 0
Probably the worst service I've ever has.  The food might be good, 0
Mediocre food and poor service. Went in there today for lunch and the server brought me the wrong drink, 0
Let me start by saying the new "Stay Well" rooms are FAB-U-LOUS. I have never, 0
Great location but down hill from there. Customer service is lacking-help was marginal at best. One highlight after my first 3 beers were not available-my waitress commented that we have 5000 beers and you can't find one!  We were ignored and left shortly after that. What's the attraction if there is no game. Try Sharps edge were knowledge-customer service-and Beer come together! PS: Staff said that fall beers were not out yet...geez, 0

free bread was the best part of my meal clam chowder was bland tuna sandwich was very strange and not appealing although i ate all the tuna mac and cheese was one of the worst i have ever had....almost as if they dumped a bottle of liquid smoke in my batch...yuck  for 114 i expected more, 0
Buddy and I had drinks and ate at the bar.  It was a Friday night but a little early so it was fairly quiet.  My buddy had Meesa wings and Sliders which he said we just OK, 0
So I ended up going back there to see if anything had changed since the last time I went. MY MISTAKE! The guy taking my order zoned out mid-order and I had to repeat myself twice. He gave me the wrong total for my order (more than it was supposed to be) and so some other guy came up and "fixed" it. Somehow it turned out to be more. I had already placed my money on the counter while I was waiting for a total and the guy tried to hold on to it and was all like "wait." I was like "NO. Every single time I've come in here I've had terrible service. This place is terrible and your staff is even worse! I'm taking my money elsewhere." I literally had to tear my money back from his hand so I could exit without causing too much of a scene. Seriously, 0

I can't say I'm much of a fan of this shoe store. The prices are pretty high and.. This may seem mean.. But they only seem to carry "old lady shoes". For all the times I've wandered in here, 0
Decent food and great atmosphere. They seem a bit short staffed though. Waited two hours after being promised 40 minute wait time. Then took 10 minutes for drinks to hit our table and then 40 minutes for food to hit the table. People (family of 3) were seated after us (5 friends) and served their food first. The prices were ok, 0
I really was hoping to like this place. I live downtown so any new addition to my neighborhood is welcome.  The good: gorgeous bar. Nice looking crowd. Decent music.  The bad: Completely lackadaisical staff. It wasn't busy.  We sit at the bar. Over 10 minutes before a bartender even notices us because she's busy socializing. Second round of drinks? Didn't happen. We got bored waiting and left.  You go to bars that are twice as busy downtown like the Griffin or Artifice and those bartenders work it. I'm not seeing that here.  NOTE: here's no sign and it's next to Global Salon, 0
I'm surprised this place is still opened. the waitress was very rude and thought that we were just high school student stopping in to eat after school ended. ordered the fried pork chops and was overcooked, 0

When I came in today 10/13/2014 at about 11:00 am for an Express Detail I had my Expedition and my parking sticker from where I work. When I left I just had my Expedition. It was on the passenger side of the car stuck to the lower part of the inside front window. These stickers are very hard to get off. So needless to say I won't be back. To bad I had been coming here for a long time., 0

Way overpriced and rude staff.  They act like they are doing you a favor by charging you and letting you in.  Disgusting!  Olympic Gardens is much better with hotter women., 0

This is for the nightclub.  It was pretty empty. No line, 0
Are the furniture prices good?  Yes.  Did it take us three trips to their store for them to get the order correct?  Yes.  When we called their customer service line due to a chip in the furniture did they tell us they wouldn't exchange even though it was the same day as delivery?  Yes.  Second experience purchasing a dining set was horrible.  What was I thinking coming back here?  See Ashley Furniture Sahara review for more details.  This company is garbage., 0
I've fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didn't care about price at the time with the coupon.   After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm.  We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasn't for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldn't be so subtle next time.   The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didn't frequent the games I would've walked out. Probably wouldn't notice.   All in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up., 0
Was truly looking forward to this stay.  Booked over the phone since I was not able to book multiple rooms.  Was promised a king-sized bed in each.  When checking in (Longer than it takes at LAX--and on a Monday) was told there were none available.  Asked if they could apply my Senior discount, 0

Truly this isn't a vietnamese restaurant... Not an asian person on staff. Sure for your urban folks this is how they tolerate eating asian food but to anyone who knows asian cuisine this is not the place to go.. First the service was nice - slow but the workers were friendly enough.. Second, 0
Stayed here for NYE. The rooms are spacious but the furniture is outdated. They did not clean our room one day and thought nothing of it. We asked room service if we could have a knife to cut some limes with for our drinks and they wanted to charge is $4. Ridiculous. Our flight got delayed to 11pm due bad weather and the latest check out they could give us was noon saying they were at full capacity. That was a lie because the lady at the front desk offered to extend the stay by one night for $130. Yeah right. All we wanted was a late afternoon check out. The shopping is also terrible. Would never stay here again., 0
I found them to be the exact opposite of the previous glowing review.  Yes, 0

Awful. I've had 8 flights this month and every single one was either delayed or cancelled. Rude. Bad customer service. No charging stations. Old planes. Cranky flight attendants. Agents are never at the gate when they're supposed to and no other agent wants to help you out.  Lesson learned: Avoid at all costs in the future., 0
Eh... its an ok place to go. The service was pretty decent when we went but it was kinda empty for a Thursday evening or maybe it was just my perception and the food was just ok..  I don't know, 0

First of all i was hoping for a romantiky evening with my wife before i left for Toronto for two weeks... The waiter was very nice but a wee bit clumsy...the view was spectacular.  The food was tasteless we got there at 730 and they had already already.run out of mussels and the place was empty.  Calamari was slightly greasy and over cooked.  Who the hell gives pasta sauce with bread.  My wife's pasta was bland and tasteless even tough it supposedly had anchovies  and according to the chef was supposed to be drowned in oil.   My seafood pasta had yesterdays over cooked squid bits and cut up shrimp that was equally over cooked and i am pretty sure made to look like mussels.  Of the four types i was supposed to get i got two.  Suffice to say even the view is not worth it cuz i could get the same one for free just by walking in front of it like i do everyday....Run from this place.  At the price they ask for you are better off going to any Giorgios or Pacini or any other italian restaurant run by people who are not italian., 0
Called to speak to who replied and got the same run around. They don't care about their tenants. The property managers are spread too thin so they quit after short periods of time. I would avoid them at all costs. We are stuck in a house that we can't sleep at night because of the neighbor's and they say I have to do all the year long work on dealing with it, 0
CVS Pharmacies are generally pretty convenient if you need to fill a prescription and just pick up an item or two.   They have a little bit of everything.  My biggest problem is they always seemed to be understaffed.  Pharmacy lines can be long depending on time of day and one cashier and 10 people in line is a bit much.  I'm sure it's hard to get the staffing levels right but if they could figure this out I would give them 3 stars.  (I would probably give then 2.5 if I could), 0
I went their two days after the grand opening and the food was ok at best. Bit pricey for the quality of food I got. I think I'll try it again next year after they get things situated there., 0

This isn't a full cupcake shop. It's a little boutique that sells what seem to be little dresses or something. We've gone there twice and both times they were out of the cupcakes that must be brought in from the actual store.  I can't comment on the cupcakes because I've never eaten them obviously. My advice...call ahead or go to an actual bakery., 0
They sent us coupons to try them out. Printed on the coupon is their hours. But in the one month that the coupon was valid, 0
Quite possibly the worst Giant Eagle in existence. Super small, 0
Very very disappointed. I can only assume that if you order off the menu it is astounding as compared to the buffet. I expected it to be expensive based on its Scottsdale location. However, 0
Very disappointed. My mother in law described our meal as barely acceptable. They were running out of items and the Salmon was extremely over cooked. I liked the pesto shrimp tortellini and the bread pudding (although it ran out fast). I will not be back again unless it's free, 0
I think I'm sorta' over The Dane. Especially this location.  It's hard to find decent parking. There's always a wait. It's loud. Service is slow. The beer is mediocre. The food is "meh."

I don't know why my review is funny?? It's the truth!!! They are in a African American community and they are not targeting the right people. Tell how is that funny please.

The truth hurts does it., 0

I loathe this bank. I have had my biz account with them for over 5 years and they never cease to amaze me with the bad policies. They will hold a check that is over a certain amount so you don't have access to the money for over a week - sometimes two.  Whenever I have an overdraft they charge double - the NSF and then an overdraft charge - daily. So if you don't keep an eye on your account every day, 0

This is the WORST Little Caesars in Vegas!! Every single time I come either at the quoted time of my order or a few minutes after and it is never ready! It seems like the staff here CANNOT communicate!   They're trying to be laid back and "cool" but it just comes across as childish and unprofessional! I get that it's a fast food restaurant but I feel like a better management team could make these kids provide a better atmosphere!  Tonight I placed my order over the phone. Was quoted 15 minutes, 0

I was really looking forward to trying this place and heard great things about it. Our service was fantastic but the food not so much. I ordered the flat iron steak cooked medium topped with shrimp and a side of cream spinach. The spinach was so hot I burned the entire roof of my mouth on my first bite so after that I couldn't taste very much. My steak came out VERY well done so I sent it back. (I felt awful that I did this) It came back pretty much blue rare. At that point I should have said just take the steak I don't want it anymore and because everyone in my party was almost done eating. I don't consider myself to be a "foodie" and felt like a complete ass when I sent it back the first time and I regret it now but I ate it. Our server Jodi was outstanding and also the gentleman that brought us our wine. He was very friendly and fun to talk to. He seemed quite passionate about the food which made it even more disappointing., 0

The place was really nice and the staff knowledgable and friendly..I thought it was a little pricey. $33.00 plus a $6.00 tip makes almost 40 bucks for a medium THIN pizza 5 wings and two cokes. I can't understand why people like this pizza. It's super thin and most of it is the huge crust which is doughy and tasteless..I guess that's why you need "dipping sauce" which I'm not used to unless ordering from Pizza Hut. They have some huge Beer Menu that's also pricey! $7.00 drafts? $4.00 for a can of Miller Lite? It's not the kind of place I want to sit around and drink in anyway..If I felt like a few beers I would just go to "Wild Wings" next door were the mood is more festive and the food better and cheaper. The wings were o.k...nothing to write home to mama about! There's a place called Stevies on 59th and 101 ..I can get better, 0
Place was good, 0
The most expensive trip to Vegas. They charge for everything.  If you would like to carry on a bag. There is a fee.  The fee to check in a carry on while booking flight starts at $25.00. At the kiosk machine $44.00. If you check in the old fashion way $100.00. Wow. Nothing is free not even .peanuts, 0

Seafood in the desert is always a challenge. Earnie's is not the place to get it. I was excited to see the menu of seafood and try it out and did the other day. The joint is located at what once was a Jilly's location. They haven't changed one thing outside of the signage either. We got sat in a corner booth and I immediately noticed the dirty table. The salt shaker was completely slathered with grease from a prior patron - half filled too.   Sat down and waited for service..and waited...and waited. Christ the place is empty, 0

Can't believe I have to give one star. Went to have my vehicle inspected which isn't a big issue at all. But man they wanted to gouge me for everything you could imagine. And asking me to replace my wiper blades because they would fail when I had just replaced them that morning.   I won't be going back and I only went there because it was close and convenient., 0
They did a good job but I got callous remover and the nail tech got some on my leg and didn't notice and I didn't think anything of it because it didn't hurt at the time but then I get home and have a huge chemical burn on my leg.

I would actually give it 2.5 because it does not meet the standards  of any RESORT we've ever stayed in (we stay in Resorts 2-3 times a year). It does not have a restaurant.   Both swimming pools are to one end of the property making it inconvenient for most guests.  Dose not have attractive grounds. It's in the middle of a business district (not retail shops) but it is easy access to a freeway and close for shopping, 0

This was the worst experience ever...we ordered 3 burgers and sides..The cashier couldn't even get that right...worst part as we sir and watch the idiots cook all the food we receive ours only to have 3 burgers literally straight from the raw package...they were disgustingly raw..As I sat and contemplated having them redone I realized the realm of employees I was dealing with...either A. Drunk still from New Year or B. Just really don't give a crap about their work  performance at all so i handed it to the cook and advised he might want ti actually cook the meat before servi g it ...he offered to cook them some more but at this point we decided if we had them redone we would end up with "special sauce" on them.    So needless to say we ended up with $40 french fries and tator tots.  Never again will I eat there., 0

The South point buffet has the worst food I ever tasted in Las Vegas well not just in Las Vegas anywhere I can't believe somebody would pay money to actually eat there. their food looks good but tastes terrible I recommend this place to nobody, 0
I was brought to this facility after breaking my leg in a motorcycle accident last January. I found a majority of the support staff to be surly and downright rude. The nursing staff was about 50/50 as far as being caring and knowledgeable as opposed to the other half who were incompetent at best, 0
I base my rating on the first and last impression of this venue. Parking. Plan for an hour to get in and at least an hour to get out. We will never be back. This venue should be embarrased. Venues double the size can get patrons in and out faster., 0
Love that it's not crowded when I go. Needs updating and most importantly they need to get wifi, 0
WORST BRIDAL SHOP EVER!!!!!!  This company is absolutley horrible! Do not give them any of your money. I am sure they will be out of business soon. Just as MOST of the other reviews on here, 0
In a word.... NOPE!   Katie M's review was EXACTLY how i felt about this place after i read it on my phone after departing from this place. Of course i noticed all the good reviews first, 0
This place is a joke. Ordered pizza on the day I was too sick to cook for my son. THEY FORGOT TO DELIVER MY FOOD! It was an hour after I ordered it that they called to tell me and told me it would take another hour. I asked for a refund. I noticed that they also charged me twice. I'd better get refunded for both!, 0
I've been to the original RDTR, 0
Horrible service. Went for a polish change on toes and nails, 0
I've been here twice - with non-local friends of course who insisted to eat here. I got good health insurance and a gym membership, 0
My 10 year old son chose this place last night to celebrate his birthday. We hadn't been in a while so that's where we ended up. It was busy, 0
Went to an Angels spring training game and got an ad for $1 nachos.  We saw their "great place to day drink" ad and though it would be good for happy hour.  The map showed it was down the street from Diablo stadium.  Ends up it's not, 0

Awful. Just plain awful.  Service and food. Yeah pizza hut is not the greatest, 0
Update on TAO : Went back last weekend. Still really nice but come on!!!!!!!  whats up with the CRAPPY MUSIC ALL NIGHT??????? By like 2:30 AM all they were playing was some 10 year old techno. And the staff is dumb as rocks - we had  to close our tab at a bar they decided to shut down and while were talking to the bartender there's some moron telling us we had to leave  the area. I literally screamed at him that we needed to get our freaking credit card back for like the 5th time! I think my run  @ Tao is over - next time were in Vegas, 0
Had Buffalo Chicken sandwich, 0
Passable fries. Burger was not good. Lobster roll ok. I apologized to everyone in my party for taking them in there., 0
It pains me to write a below average review for Kaya.  I have loved Kaya for years but have been away from the restaurant for quite a while because recent menus did not appeal to my wife and I enough.  Anyway my wife convinced me that we needed to go back so we did.  While I was pleased with the current menu and received excellent service, 0
Pizza is definitely not NY style. Soft crust not crisp like NY pizza. Mediocre pizza at best.  Crust tastes like frozen pizza crust. I wont be going back., 0
While I had high hopes for elevation and I appreciate the idea of organic beef and products. I wasn't impressed. Their ingredients are fresh, 0
This was the most horrible waste of time I've ever experienced, 0
This could have been my go to celebration spot. I wanted to like it so much I went twice, 0
I have been coming to Spacolis since they opened thier doors last year. In the first few months this place rocked, 0
Well I'm sad to write this but they have delivered to my house before and this time they tried to come out here which is a mile away from the restaurant and instead of calling me when they couldn't find it they just went back and ignored it.  Totally unprofessional and fucked up.  Wow. Way to run a business.  Maybe if the person answering the phone for delivery could understand English then they could get an address correct.  Fuck this place.  I'm still hungry. Assholes, 0
My boyfriend booked a room at Mandalay Bay for my birthday trip to Vegas. We specifically picked Mandalay Bay because we had such a great time when we stayed  there 3 years ago. We couldn't wait to go back for this occasion!  When we arrived to check in, 0
About as lackluster as BBQ gets. There is nothing at Famous Dave's beyond mediocre. And the service is curt at best, 0
You just don't realize how nice Southwest is until you fly with these bozos. Old MD80s with tiny seats wedged together and bins that hold nothing so you have to check a carryon bag make it miserable. The crews seem jaded because everyone is miserable on the plane and they have just given up. I will do my best to avoid American, 0
Wir sind rein, 0
We thought that when the name changed they may have also improved the quality of the food, 0
If it was noon (lunchtime) on a Sunday when the NFC championship game was playing........don't you think they'd staff appropriately knowing that there would be a crap load of people?  Not BWW.  We were seated quickly, 0
Never eat here in the day time, 0
Disappointing.  Walked into a virtually empty restaurant, 0
It is possible to get really bad Mexican in the SouthWest. I rarely ever get burned with my food choices, 0
I just recently stayed at the Vdara with some friends, 0
This place was a real let down.  I had dinner here with a couple friends and we were all of a similar opinion.  First off the prices are a bit over inflated as is evident by the constant "sale" prices on the menu, 0
Grumble. I would hate to be measured by my worst day at work, 0
I'll preface this review by saying that I was there on a Saturday night, 0
New place with a lot of kinks to work out! First off having the entrance at the far right side of the place is just wrong. I am not sure how long Biscuits has been open, 0
My visit was a complete disappoinment.  I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt's, 0
Do not waste your time! Called to get combinations to 2 of our safes redone at my retail location. He gave me the price of his service charge and an estimate of what it would cost, 0
Stayed here last weekend for a girls trip. Horrible customer service. I will never stay again... But I might eat at the beach bar restaurant, 0
Not very good.  I had the salmon and the BBQ wasn't very good.  The veggies were supposed to be grilled but didn't appear to be.  My father had the ultimate fajita which included pulled pork.  We've never been to a Mexican restaurant that had that in it.  He was also disappointed with his food.  On the plus side the staff is friendly., 0
I used to like this place but wow, 0
The residential apartments above Maharani have serious cockroach problems., 0
I went with my wife and daughter to have dinner there we order spaghetti with meat sauce and pizza half Hawaiian and half supreme when are spaghetti got there it was the nastiest plate I ever seen it was like a soup super watery did not taste good at all when are pizza got there it was so watery like they did not strain the pineapple it was just a horrible experience the Supreme side was alright and the wings was the only good thing that I would go eat there other then that I don't like the food here., 0
Perhaps all of the great reviews set me up for disappointment, 0
If you're looking for over priced shoes in tiny sizes then this is the store for you! No slip resistant work shoes for under $70 or in larger sizes., 0
I love butterfield's and my family and I go there every sunday to go eat breakfast. But the only problem is the girls that work up in the front are a little ignorant to people and for it being so early in the morning not a lot of people really want to deal with that. One time my mom asked the girl if she could borrow a pen the girl looked at her said she didn't have one yet they had a whole bunch of pens in a holder....gee..what great service. The waiters are great!!! they always are on top of their game and of course since we are regulars they love to talk to us. We have told them about the girls but I think this is a perfect way to put them on blast! If you are working at a place that considers great customer service (obviously everywhere) then fake a smile and put that nasty attitude away. Being rude is not good customer service. Other than that go to Butter Fields! they have the best food of course :), 0
Disappointing Chinese bakery. The baked goods are freshly baked right out of the oven but don't taste that great. The bread was tough and other items did not look too appetizing; like the cracked egg tarts. The ladies behind the counter could care less about their customers. They just chatter away without paying any attention to you.  It's much better in SF., 0
This place was so disoriented when I visited.  I went for dinner and we had to wait an hour for the food to come after we ordered from the server.  The meals all came out at different times and it was so awkward to all eat at different times.  My food was not hot at all so I had to send it back.  The waiter wasn't really giving us a good explanation of why it was taking so long and why the food didn't come out hot.  She said that the cooks don't know how to cook in the kitchen.... hmmm. The manager didn't have any idea why the kitchen was being so slow., 0
What kind of night club denies you entrance on a Thursday when its only you 1 person and want you to get table service when its only yourself specially when you are coming out of state that is freaking pathetic okay specially when they say locals its fine makes no freaking sence lame af! avoid go somewhere else on a Thurs. fix your bouncers or yourself as a club #pathetic, 0
Very rude uncalled for service the food was excellent though and that's why i gave two stars. The waitress (lady) outback serving the tables on Memorial day by the bar outside really needs to check her attitude. In the future I will give this place a second try., 0
Disgusting!  I've always wanted to go here because the buildings and the decor pulled me in. The food was worse than fast food. Pasta was overcooked. Broccoli tasted old, 0
So my wife and I have gone to this place several times now. The food isn't horrible. The price isn't horrible. The service is very horrible. Every time I go in here I feel like they think I just kicked their dog. The first couple times I thought maybe the girls serving us were just having horrible days but now every single time we have gone in there they are rude to us. I try to be extra nice to see if maybe I can get them to be decent just for a little but no luck. I'm sure they are upset that people don't tip what they think is appropriate but I know I tip very well and even did the first couple times. But I will not being going to a place where they don't appreciate my business. There are buffets on every corner and maybe they don't realize this but maybe they will when they are closed next year., 0
Horrible birthday experience! They called an hour before to confirm the reservation and left a message saying they would cancel if the call was not returned, 0
I called toward the end of the night so I'm not really surprised that the lady that picked up seemed a bit passive-aggressive when I told her I wasn't ready to order and was just asking how late they were open. I called a few minutes later and they told me that it would take an hour since the driver would be taking the pizza on his way home. The driver was a nice, 0
I honestly think that the Bellagio is highly overrated.  Our room wasn't any more impressive than at MGM or Mandalay Bay, 0
Amazing view to Bellagio fountain show if you seat outside, 0
The best feature is the pool, 0
I had a gift certificate or otherwise I would never have gone there.  (Not a meat eater).  However, 0
Stopped by here last night and this business has gone out of business.  Signs on the front door said this location is permanently closed, 0

Believe this place was closed last week.  Husband went to pick up a cord they forgot to give us and doors were locked.  Glad we got the computer out in time., 0
Not food network worthy yet they claim Guy has been there and loved it was highly unimpressed not going back ever, 0
ugh. the wings are disgusting. can't say much more for the service either., 0
Chompies is awful, 0
I've been coming here and even worked here as my first job 15 years ago. It's going downhill. I order a coffee it's cold I send it back and they say they'll brew another pot so I go park and wait on nuggets and coffee. They bring food to car the new coffee same cold temperature missing fries in bag and never gave me the bottle of water I ordered! I understand hiring kids cause I was one that worked here but this place is terrible now. The manager needs to manage and monitor things better!, 0
Why does everything list this as a top tourist attraction? It's a never ending maze of shopping malls. There's nothing interesting about it. If you want to shop, 0
They lost my bag. The staff was NOT friendly, 0
Worst service if any Starbucks. Waited in line 35 minutes to place an order, 0
Brunch was very disappointing--like a bad expensive Denny's. Bloody Mary bar is outstanding and the building is nice, 0
Came in for a few drinks with co-workers after work  THE FOOD  Bar food. Not bad, 0
Nightmare to deal with.  The store is fun to walk through. But that's it.  They make a lot of promises about low prices and quality. But the few times I've purchased products, 0
My least favorite sushi experience in a long time . . .I've had better from the grocery store in those plastic boxes.  Took an employee on their recommendation.  I guess it's quite different at happy hour and the evening.  Very nice surroundings down to the fish swimming in the floor. That day it must have been a "two-fer"  Sushi and attitude all for the price of the sushi.  Rachel T. sums it up well!, 0
They don't accept appointments for lab work. So, 0
Just left and had a really good time until the end. There was a costume contest and our friend came in second. He won a bottle or so we thought. Went to the bar to claim it and the bartender said he already gave it to the person the owner told him to give it to. The bartender is the same person who announced our friend won second place!  We asked to speak to the owner who had Already mysteriously left. I wonder whose friend got the bottle? This was our first AND last time we Will go there. Our waitress was amazing. Don't know her name but She was dressed as a fire fighter. Its too bad that they lost 5 new customers over this. We only live 5 minutes away and I thought we found our new  football hangout but I guess not. Cheaters., 0
Pretty much worst Italian ever. Calamari, 0
GREASY! expensive and the actual restaurant was gross...food all over the floor...etc.  If you want a truly greasy burger that tastes like artery plaque then have at it. I'll stick with In & Out., 0
I don't get it. Average food at best.  Insanely large menu and confusing, 0
CLOSED DUE TO LANDLORD LEASE FORECLOSURE SITUATION  They're looking to reopen in new space somewhere soon., 0

Avoid this place in the airport. 20 minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable. I had to wolf down my food to make my flight when I should have had plenty of time. Epic fail BK, 0
My friend and I went to Planet Hollywood expecting good things. We were unpleasantly surprised.  When we checked in, 0
First...they wont take a credit card.  That alone will keep me from going back.    Second...very poor service.  The waitress took our order and never came back.  I had to walk up to the front just to ask for the ticket so that I could pay.  They sent me back to my table and told me to wait for the [absent] waitress to bring me the check.  I also was not brought my entire order.  They went back to the kitchen to get the rest but never returned.    Third...the options were dismal even though the portions were large.  They have no pickles for burgers, 0

Please don't confuse "Mekong Plaza" with "Mekong Palace". "Mekong Plaza" is one of the finest Oriental shopping center In Mesa (my opinion). "Mekong Palace" is a newly open Chinese Dim Sum diner (restaurant?) at the north end of the Plaza (basically a Food Court). I happen to be shopping at the "Mekong Plaza grocery store". I was excited to try out this new restaurant. (I wish I had read the review before - but I didn't - unfortunately).  One of my favorite Chinese foods is "Dim Sum". Being it's newly open; I figure they would have some pretty good food.  Exactly the opposite!   I wish I can say something nice; let me see; well the Tea was pretty good; and the ice water was pretty good. The waitress is pretty, 0
You will not find costumer service here! The sushi was okay, 0

The food here is good but there is 1 server here with a bad attitude who ruins the whole experience. A short little skinny woman with black hair and the requisite tattoos for this part of town. It's such a shame because this place has good food. But I won't come back because of little Miss Frowny Face. Hint: If you don't make your guests feel welcome they won't come back. The place used to be jamming but it's now empty at lunch time, 0
First time to this place. Made a proactive effort with the manager/owner to learn all about this place. More than 60 minutes after placing our order and no initiative by our server to assure us our meal was coming we asked for an update. The manager/owner came to the table to say, 0

Read Yelp reviews which indicated a record of very good work delivered and trust. Then found a very disappointing process attempting to secure an appointment to get an estimate. Called office number and was promised a return call to set an appointment.No call came. Called again and did recieve a return call. Scheduled an appointment and then the estimator was a no-show. Called back to main number and empathy was low and no accomodation for two service failures was provided. Even got a little lecture from the scheduler about how busy they are. Really? So am I. Gave up and started searching for another provider., 0

I was anxious to try their famous "frozen hot chocolate" but was a bit bummed because it really wasnt ALL that- I have no idea what all the hype was about.  My friend had a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate when purchasing 10 dollars so we ended up getting a pepperoni pizza that was overly greasy. I know pizza can get oily but there was a LOT of oil- pretty gross when the cheese is sagging down with the oil drips.., 0
It's such a shame really... I used to enjoy going to Howies Restaurant, 0
SAVE YOUR MONEY HONEY!  For 3 people we spent $95 all to look at computer screens? Ok you start off with a crime scene and then you go from computer to computer to "Solve the case." which could have been a fun concept if it weren't for the fact that its programmed to solve it for you. OK fun right.  So basically all you do is go from one computer station to another click a mouse and boom that's your "CSI Experience" The kicker is you get a diploma afterwards which is an EXTRA $5.95 nope they couldn't include that piece of paper in the $95 they initially charged.   RIP OFF  Me id rather watch paint dry., 0
Awful Place, 0
The Playboy club isn't really a club. It's more of an expensive place to gamble. All the girls are dressed up in bunny suits and I'm pretty sure the tables are on the high end. It's just a room basically, 0
Walk-in humidor was well-stocked though I did not detect the familiar "closeness" that a humidor's humidifier creates. A broad selection of top brands was available. Prices ranged from about $5 a stick (for low-end brands) to about $18/stick for top of the line stuff. The median price range was about $7 to $10. The staff seemed cordial though a bit distracted and not particularly helpful. I would probably only resort to this shop on a "plan B" basis., 0
I am Not a fan. A la carte pricing means your dinner becomes really expensive really fast. There are things on the menu (like the ground beef tacos) that are simply not good. If friends want to go here, 0
Do not bring your car here. My car broke down on a Sunday. I knew this place was open. We got my car started and took it there. We asked alot of questions before agreeing for the work to be done. The first question we asked was do you back up your work. The person at the desk stated they do.  They said they would check the car out and call me with what is wrong. They called after about an hour, 0

Update and bad news: BEDBUGS! I was all bitten after coming home. Called them and they were very unapologetic, 0
Worst I have ever had. Waited more than an hour in line. Line is not so long. It just doesn't really move. Looks like it will need another 20 minutes to get to desk. Will never rent with them again. Used several other rental companies before. Budget, 0
Wife went there with her wedding party to get their hair and make-up done and had an absolutely dreadful experience. Staff was incredibly rude and incompetent., 0
I wondered what happened to what Fry's used to be.  I walked into the store and thought I was in Food City.  This was the last grocery store in the area that the multicultural population could shop at.  It now caters to the Hispanic population.  They stopped baking fresh rolls for sandwiches and the stock in the aisles is all Hispanic oriented.  Geesh!, 0

If I could give them zero stars I would. Do NOT go here if you want to have fun in Vegas.  The employees here are extremely rude and the pool area is filled with even more rude employees. My brother waved hi to the life guard and got kicked out of the pool area because he could "potentially TOUCH a girl." EXCUSE ME!?!? THIS ASSUMPTION IS DISGUSTING AND DISRESPECTFUL. Even the people around were appalled and agreed that he should not be kicked out.  Absolutely absurd., 0

Absolutely the worst HOA ever so I agree with all the previous reviews. Totally unresponsive after they send you vague violation notices and they seem to want to just cowtow to the Board that just hired them. Avoid any community managed by this group., 0

Let me start by saying what a horrible experience i had in this hotel. I travel from New York to Las Vegas at least twice a year and i always stay at high end hotels. I decided to give this place a chance but they failed miserably. When i just arrived they took 3 hours to find my east tower studio terrace room because they were "sold out". After i requested to speak to general floor supervisor the room magically appeared available that moment. Second day being in a hotel my room was never cleaned. I called 5 times to cleaning extension i had to be on hold for 15 minutes each time before they picked up the phone. I requested to speak to a manager and  told him my room wasn't cleaned for whole day. Still cleaning lady never arrived that day so i had to reuse wet towels and sleep on unmade bed. Next day at 4 pm she finally arrived and did her job. They charge you $25 resort fee that includes internet wifi. On third day wifi did not work for maybe 7 hours. To go in to one of their pools i had to pay money, 0
I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....  I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, 0
Probably the lousiest chicken & service I have had in a while.  The hot sauce is straight from the bottle with all heat & no flavor., 0
I was so disappointed with my stay! They gave me a dirty room so they moved me to another "upraded" room for the trouble. They charged my credit card $2000.00 and even produced an altered receipt saying I authorized it! Beware they are crooks! Also just for your own information check out bbb.org and check out there record before deciding to stay here!, 0
SHIT HOLE!!!  Too bad 0 stars is not an option here.  The staff and management are rude and only want money.  Someone sprayed pepper spray and sent multiple patrons to the ER and the staff just sat there like they could care less.  Save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet!.  This place is so ghetto and trashy.  All the money they make from $30 admissions and it still looks the same as it did in 1974.  Disgrace to the gay community!!, 0
Wow Aria! You really went out of your way this time! Above and beyond! That's right; you made it painfully clear you do not wish us to return. It wasn't just the bait-and-switch of reservation prices at the counter, 0

Tony and crew lure you in with a $86.50 fee for a diagnostic and then found a horn ring or clock spring issue.  This is a cheap part and 30 min of labor according to the dealer.  We got hit with a charge of $565!  According to the dealer this should have been no more than $250 part and labor.  I recommend having any electrical diagnosed elsewhere as they used to be a great shop but have slid in recent years.  Buyer beware., 0
This is probably the worst Target I have ever visited. I do not understand the layout of this store at all and it always takes me twice as long to find something than it does at any other Target. I have hopelessly searched around for over 15 minutes before I even found a sales associate to help me. And today solidified by desire to never return. I encountered 3 unbelievably rude sale staff one of whom refused to move their cart for me so that I (and the lady behind me with 2 young kids) could pass by. Instead, 0

**** WOW!  Just realized 7 "filtered reviews" all give Nyam Nyam ONE STAR.  Click on "filtered" at the bottom of the list of glowing reviews.  Really disgusted at Yelp at the moment. ********  I don't have much to add to my husband's review, 0
They have bad service. They take awfully long on delivery and I live right down the street. Then they call me after 40 minutes of ordering my pizza saying they did not have it. I was getting very frustrated cause I was hungry. Go to the one on Boulder., 0
I am still trying to figure this place out... The decor is off and the restaurant almost feels unfinished. We tried the pecan, 0

It's an ok breakfast place.  The place is overhyped.  This is no different than what I can make myself.  The coffee is ok.  I was disappointed they did not offer real cream with it.  Instead, 0

Hugely disappointing. Service was poor and management didn't seem to care. If your a steakhouse in encore you don't have to be good you will always apparently be busy. Waitress had too many tables at once. Much better dishing in Vegas for that price. Great sommelier though., 0
Skip this place. The coffee tastes burned and stale. Service is far too slow for an airport., 0
I had a really sad experience at Ulta today. I went in to refill my perfume "Angel" by Thierry Mugler. The sign said " Bring Your Own Bottle save $30". The lady who works there didn't know how to refill the bottle and couldn't tell me how much it costs (new ones 1.7 are $80) she got the manager who was even worse and quoted me the regular price of $80 for refilling the bottle/ completely disregarding the store's sign!! False advertising and awful management would describe the ULTA I went to. I know there is a more sincere business near me who cares about my time and money. I am very sorry that people have to face such dishonest managers and poor customer service., 0

This Starbucks sucks. In terms of cleanliness and quality... It's fine. Standard. But the PRICE. It costs almost as much as eating at a normal breakfast place. Also I just really needed a cup of water and got told it's $.75 for water. Awesome Starbucks. I will go down the way and eat at an actual restaurant if I am going to pay $35 for 2 breakfast sandwiches, 0

What can you expect from a place as loud and obnoxious as this?  Being in here brought back memories of my 20's.  Not in a good way either.  Food was a greasy sloppy mess.  Made me feel ill afterward.  Service was not horrible but wasn't great either.  They brought out the wrong order for my hubby but corrected it pretty quickly.  It was near empty when we went but all the TVs were blasting at a decibel way too loud for any undrunken ears.  But I suppose it's a whole different experience when you come at night to drink and ride the bull.  Unfortunately we were here for lunch after doing some shopping.  Definitely won't be back..., 0

Took my '95 ETS to Lund Cadillac to have the AC recharged this January.

This was my second trip in and I was hoping for better.  I had the cubano panini and could barely eat it.  First off when it arrived it looked sloppy...you know the bread didn't line up ..like it was thrown together.  It was heavy on the mustard and pickles.  So much that I couldn't taste anything else.  I don't think the bread was very fresh either.  It just didn't have that grilled, 0
I bet back in the day Stratosphere use to be an awesome hotel to stay at. But now time has passed it by.  It just feels like an old casino off the stripe now. There's nothing sexy about this place  -no really good restaurants or buffets here.  -the bar/lounge on top is lame.  -no good attractions to draw you in.   -The guest that stay here are old/ugly/ and just depressing.   -rooms resemble a motel 6, 0

Wow... My friend asked for a Cabernet 4 different times to 2 different servers an it took over 35 minutes even after they discussed the wine list to him.. Then she finally came to the table an said your cabs here.... We were like where? This server thought we meant a cab like in a ride... The foods good but the servers are terrible., 0
I started going here since the place opened a few years ago. There was no other Chinese place in Surprise (that I knew of) at the time. Oil is definitely a main ingredient in their dishes. The beef dish I had once was pretty bad and never ordered it again but always loved the orange chicken with lo mein noodles. Lunch specials are pricey. Now that I'm a vegetarian, 0
I was excited to try this place based off of the reviews but in the end I was disappointed. It has a convenient store feel with a fast food place inside of it. The food was ok at best, 0

I would never go again. Food was cold and not fresh. I had to send back my fries because they were cold. Service was mediocre. Although the vibe was pretty cool.  You would get a better meal at Denny's., 0
New Years Day and this was the only pizza spot in Squirrel Hill open late. I decided to take a chance on this place... The service was horrible. Then to add insult to injury the pizza was beyond unappetizing. The toppings were dry and over cooked  on the Bellino Pie not to mention the fact that there was barely any cheese or sauce.... Just dry over cooked toppings. We also ordered the chef Bellino pie.... It clearly stated white garlic sauce... There was no sauce at all. Actually, 0
I am an Indian and I love Indo-chinese food. Was excited to see manchurian on the menu Worst Manchurian you can have!! The uttapam was very sour too! Had some chaat which was okay. I told the waiter that the manchurian was really bad and he did nothing about it. Do not recommend :/, 0
The spa is pretty run down and my first robe was visibly dirty.    My package included a 50 minute massage which was not horrible but definitely was not good.  It was to include a 25 min body polish and a frangipani hair treatment.  The frangipani hair treatment was nothing like the description in their spa menu;  I am pretty sure she did not put anything in my hair when she rubbed my scalp, 0
So I have now been here many times and I have to say that my previous review must have been from an amazing night here.   The last few times I was here the burger quality has gone downhill significantly. The tomatoes were green and crunchy. The lettuce was white or almost white. The bread was either stale or soggy. The meat was under or over cooked. Not good.   We used to come here for their amazing shakes. The last bunch of times I've been here their shakes have been lackluster. They have obviously changed their ice cream supplier. They were using high quality and now it's probably equal to off brand at Walmart. I probably won't be back!, 0
The customer service was very good. The food LOOKED amazing and SMELLED amazing but the flavor was just meh.   The food was pretty bland and the pulled pork and brisket were dry. The smoked sausage looked and tasted overcooked. The macaroni and cheese could have benefited from a better blend of cheeses and the sprinkling of red pepper on top was unnecessary. The sweet potato fries were awesome, 0
I was excited to try this place since I heard so much rave reviews during my visit in NY.  I was disappointed.....!!  We went on a Tuesday @ 1:00pm and we had a flight to catch at 3:30.  There was no line and the service was quick.  We ordered chicken wings, 0

Old working man's bar. People are nice for the most part- bartenders are less skanky (some even nice) than the bars in the neighborhood with the same owner.   Nothing special about the place- just a neighborhood dive. Sometimes there are a lot of bikers- the neighborhood is going to hell. Shoot out just the other day- saw a man blocking traffic on Peoria right in front of the place, 0
Ordered food to go at 130 today and was told it would be ready at 202pm via email.... did not receive food until 245pm and was late for work because of it... also the employees were very rude and did not want to help me... thanks for letting me down and the bbq was just ok not great, 0

This place is awful. Including the delivery folk. Consistently lose mail or don't deliver it, 0
Come here for the Italian beef. But the Asian lady who cleans the tables is just too much. She comes over to my booth and starts cleaning up. I had to get something to clean the table myself before and now she tries cleaning up around me while I am eating. She takes my tray and bag so now I am supposed to clear off my table when I leave? With what?, 0
So my buddy called me to let me know that his car broke down and he was having it towed to the shop that he and his brother have been going to for a long time.  I am talking like 10 years.  And yes the shop I am referring to is Airpark Auto Service.  He text me to let me know that this place quoted him $1300 to do his water pump, 0
The food is actually ok. Margarita LITERALLY made me puke, 0
I went in a few weeks ago and the man that took care of me was very rude. He jerked my feet around, 0
Probably the second worst detail I've had on my xterra. The left some spray  that they used n my dash on my windows that didn't come with cleaner.  Unfortunately it was darker out when I picked my car back up so didn't inspect it very good.  They are ok for cleaning the outside, 0
This place was quite disappointing! The check-in process was quite smooth, 0
This casino hotel is not that bad. I just have experienced better. The room is tolerable. The casino is small and smoky. The elevators are kind of scary. The parking garage is old and sucky. I do not mind walking so the distance from the Strip is not that bad. I would not pay more that 40 a night though., 0
Terrible restaurant - my friend got very sick twice on the sushi and their frozen drinks taste  toxic.  Servers and bartenders rude and arrogant.  Glasses dirty and crowd sleazy.  Board of health should be checking out this place!, 0

Booked a suite for 3 nights and was promised that there we would receive a set of buffet tickets for each night. TOTAL LIE!  Service was also horrible. We asked for extra blankets the first night and they were never delivered. We asked again for extra blankets the second night and housekeeping brought them by throwing the blankets at me!  Not going back ever again., 0
It's sad. I had a reasonably pleasant croissant two days ago and was very pleased with the quality of the baguettes. I bought two and they were delicious.   HOWEVER. The cappuccino was a piece of mess. It was more close to a caffe latte. It wasnt even a foamy latte. Hardly any foam. and then, 0
Maybe we came on a bad night but that was so not impressive. Some of the worst service I've had in a while. They took forever to take our order in a non crowded restaurant. I barely remember what we got due to starvation messing with my brain that night. However I do remember that we ordered four quail eggs for two people, 0

Yet another vegas disappointment.    I went here with my fiance and a few close friends last year for our engagement party.  We each ordered the four course prix fixe menu and were very disappointed.    The service was slow and the waitstaff knew nothing about the food they were serving us.   I think the only person there that even has the slightest idea as to what he's doing is the sommelier., 0

Not Impressed!!!  I stopped in to get a pedi was told it was a 15 min wait....45 MINUTES LATER they finally started- and a day later my polish started to peel!!!

Eek! Methinks not. My ears are still ringing from the unbelievable scene that unfolded when I told the guy his place sucked. It is a place to have drink and not much else. This place sucked when it was Ruby Tuesday, 0

A little disappointed about the service. They used to be more friendly.I have been a customer for over 10 years. They have changed owners several times I believe. It's just not the same anymore.

I think that this is basically your typical brewery restaurant ... nothing special that can be raved about. I'm not much into beer but have tried a few from their selection - the Hefeweizen & Sunbru are two I've liked. As far as the food goes, 0
I was going to give three stars because its  chicken fingers and French fries.  I decided this place deserves only two stars because they have only four items in the menu -oh, 0

Not impressed.   Ruth's Chris is not the end all of steak houses, 0
This place charges $8.00 FOR WATER.  They refused to give me tap water AND they gave me a small Fiji water for 8 bucks.  I thought water was my right as a human being?  The only reason they get a second star is because Andrew Keegan was at the club the night I went.  Not that I am a huge fan girl or anything, 0
After a really good recommendation from a friend out of state, 0
I used to love it here but not since new management. The old (great) nail techs left since the takeover and they haven't been the same since. My last visit was horrible. I wanted just a trim on my nails and she took all the length off. She then rushed the whole routine and didn't bother cleaning the sides. Clearly I will not be returning.   On a good note...I've found some of the old crew in the next parking lot over at TLC Nails., 0

This is NOT a real Lotions & Potions. The owner of this store is posing as the founder and franchise owner for Lotions & Potions and was even shut down over 15 years ago for posing as a Lotions & Potions before. If you would like to get QUALITY products and superior service, 0

My boyfriend and I had been considering cleaning services for awhile. We both work full time and with to toddlers the last thing we want to be doing on our days off is cleaning. I orginally saw a living social deal for another company but with poor yelp reviews I opted to pay a little more for what I hoped would be a better exprience. I filled out an on line questionaire and then recieved a phone call a few days later with a quote. I spoke to Matt and told him what I was looking for. A deep thorough clean to start and then a bi-weekly service of touch ups. I also let him know I had family coming in town and wanted to change one of the bi-weekly cleans to a few days earlier to accommidate my guests. He was able to do that no problem! I also went over some of my biggest areas of concerns like door frames being wiped down (toddlers lover to run there hands over everything) he made notes of all my concerns. I was excited about my clean and couldnt wait to come home to a clean house  fast forward to cleaning day.... Our cleaner shows up she was friendly but asked if this was the first time cleaning in our home or if this was a repeat clean. This threw me off because I was told I was getting an exprienced cleaner who will come in and deep clean my house and pay attention to areas of concern. Was she not told everything I discussed 3 days prior with Matt? This shouldve been our first red flag but we ignored it and moved on. We let her know we were going to run errands to get the babies out of the house so they would not be in the way and if she could give us a call when she was done we would appreciate it. 3hrs goes by we dont get a call but decided to head hme and check it out. Upon entering our home we find that our GAS stove top was left on and the house was full of gas we are lucky there wasnt an emergency like our house blowing up. Once we opened all the doors and windows we walked through the house and immidetaly I was disappointed. Apart from some parts of the floors being cleaned and the beds made not much else was done. I called Matt and left him a message. No call back. I then sent an email asking to cancel the bi-weekly schedule i signed up for. He responded asking if I found a better rate. That annoyed me slightly as he knew I had my house cleaned the prior day I left him a message noo returned call and he didnt ask how my exprience was just if i found a cheaper rate. ANyways I told him about my frustrations with my clean. He offered to send what I understood to be a touch up crew which I let him know I would not be happy with. I didnt need a touch up I needed a cleaning... the one I paid for. He told me he could send Jayme a quality control manager to check out my house the following day. When she got there I let her know I was just frustrated at my exprience and I showed her the checklist provided by her company and we went down the list and I showed her maybe 3 things of the 49 things were done. She agreed that everything was missed  ceiling fans not wiped blinds not wiped window sills not wiped switch plates not wipes door frames not wiped cabinets not wiped the only mirror in my house not wiped shelves not wiped we closed my daughters door and realised everything was just swept behind there  Jayme was nice and super apologic and ensured me this was not acceptable and not there standards and offered me a complete reclean at my convenience. I accepted and asked for Matt to call me that day so we could work out a time. I dont recieve a call so I send an email. I dont hear anything until the next day. I didnt really feel a sincere apologly but I am hoping Jayme let him know why I was so frustrated. What did the last cleaner do in my house for 3hrs? Anyways the re clean is today and again I a mtaking my kids out of the house so as not to be in the way. I just hope this time I am blown away and get the deep clean I am hoping for.  I will post a follow up review after todays cleaning., 0

Run by scumbags.  If you contact a promoter to get on the guestlist the doormen pretend that they don't know who that promoter is.  Huge line outside 1+ hour wait and the club is completely empty.  They are just trying to hype it up and make people want to pay $10 to come here.  That seriously killed everyone's buzz.  Ended up ditching the line and cover charge for NO line and NO cover charge at Axis and had a great time!, 0

No just no. The food was way below PAR I ordered the chicken enchiladas thinking it should be a delightful one..It was a big fat NO! Chicken was not cooked and the sauce was so bland I wanted to slap myself for coming to this place. A big let down to cheap and easy mexican food.., 0
The service was "eh" and the food was "meh." Not planning on returning any time soon., 0
Very disappointing. Only thing that saves this place is the service. Overpriced food that isn't really that good, 0
This place charged my credit card three times, 0
Big disappointment.  Little competition for the nearby Milio's Subs. The menu is a little confusing with silly mining names.   I think they are overpriced for the quality and my sandwiches were just ok and nothing that tasty.   Went there twice and went back to Milio's., 0
I had the lamb burger with sweet potato fries and the nutella milkshake a couple of weeks ago.  The lamb burger was OK, 0
I got excited to try this place after seeing a 4.5 star review.  I am a sucker for good carne asada tacos so I ordered the carne asada tacos with onions, 0
There is always a good 20 min wait every time I come to this location. On the plus side I guess you know it's fresh but 20 mins takes the fast out of fast food! The staff is usually very nice but they've messed up my order more than once giving me regular chicken wings instead of boneless. The sauces are ok. Even their hottest isn't very hot though. After mild it seems like all the other sauces have the same mediocre hotness.. Even atomic. On a plus side, 0
Now I really try to like this place, 0
wanted to try something new so stopped at nacho daddys. was hoping for a full on mexican style restraunt. first thing server told us is that they were known for thier nachos(of course). i even ordered the house recomondation of bland sparsley loaded bbq chicken nachos. my husband had a burger!! not impressed n not going back, 0
Extremely over priced!  Many hard to find items can be purchased at regular grocery stores these days. I kept getting sick from eating their soups only to find out that the bad produce that wasn't sold was given to the chef's along with the old meat to make the fresh soups everyday., 0
Should have went to pita jungle... Chicken tacos are pretty bland. The nachos were good but salty., 0
The food is ok for 1am food. I've had better but it is definitely edible.  However I waited over 30 minutes despite nudging twice to pay. They are massively understaffed, 0
very very let down. service was super slow and food was garbage. I got the duck quesadilla thinking it was going to be great because of the reviews and everything but I was sadly mistaken. Perhaps I should have gotten the crispy quesadilla instead of the large soft one and there is where I went wrong. But in any case, 0
My husband and I eat at the establishment on Spring Mountain since it's close to my home. My husband was on the other side of town and decided to phone in a pick up order to bring home. I dont really care for their ramen, 0
We were extremely excited to find out that Rice Trax was finally re-opening after many months of waiting. However, 0
I don't normally write negative reviews but the service we got at this place was less than stellar.  On a Friday night we popped in to get a round of drinks before last call.  We ordered a couple Espolon shots and a beer for the 2 of us to share.  After waiting at the least crowded bar for about 10 minutes, 0
While it is hit or moss with the masseuse you get, 0
This place is definitely a place you dont want to go to if your looking for a job. I went in for a Wednesday interview she said i will wait sometime for the other manager to setup a second interview because the first one went okay, 0
This is one of those in-between ratings. It's better than "Meh. I've experienced better" and worse than "a-OK"  It's a convenient location for me, 0
Not impressed. I will stick to Lowes. I went to a Chiropractor in the same parking lot as Home Depot. I wasn't even parked anywhere near the Depot. Very windy day and no one was collecting their shopping carts one of them flew into my car and left a huge dent. I brought the cart inside and told them about it and they really didn't seem to care. they just sent someone outside to get them. So no I have a huge dent in my car., 0
Friday night was the second time I've visited this place. Atmosphere was nice, 0

Check the top of your tv cabinet!! Hmmm....the main reason we stayed was the lazy river.  We went with some friends who insisted that the lazy river was the best thing in the world and it was pretty awesome.  So they get one star for that.  It was great, 0
I had to take a couple of weeks to write this review since negative reviews aren't my thing and felt that a cooling off period was necessary.   We were guests of the Golden Nugget July 21st-23rd and we do choose to stay here frequently and enjoy all it has to offer.  After checking in on Monday afternoon, 0
We have been shopping at this location since we moved into the neighborhood this past year. Copp's (the past year or two) has really gone down hill. We normally do our big shopping at Woodman's because it's cheaper. We'd go to this Copp's more but 1, 0
Im giving this place two stars because I love the first location at 20th St & Highland.  That place was always great.  This place was pretty bad.. at least on this visit.   We arrived to eat to see a packed parking lot. Many people were eating at Oregano's and we've always enjoyed NYPD.  As we walked in, 0
How Horrible can it be.....Well let me tell you.  The food was uneatable and that is putting it nicely.  It started with no appetizers, 0
This place is a joke. They have the most ridiculous parking validation process I have ever seen. I attempted to validate my parking at the cage. They told me a floor person needed to do the validating and to hit the service button on a  machine. We did. Waited for 15 minutes at a random machine. Even had security page a floor person. Finally resorted to physically walking and flagging someone down. Then this woman wants to argue w us that she didn't see us playing so she refused to validate even after we explained that we were on the other side of the floor when we played. We did what the cage person said to do. Had to pay for parking. But oh wait I have no more cash. And they don't take credit cards.  So I had to go back in and buy something from subway just to get out of the parking garage. Super pissed I will never spend a penny here again., 0
Food here is good. Service is bad and the people are rude and also very dumb. Hi-hoh!, 0
Terrible grumpy rude and obnoxious tech showed up at our house and proceeded to yell at me. I asked him to address me with respect, 0
Meh. Ordered two coffees. Their regular roast was horrible. It tasted like it was made with chlorinated pool water. Also ordered a flavored "flat white" which is a light foam cappuccino. Again, 0
Hey 1 OAK, 0
I might be jaded since I often get free access to a lot of things in LV so I don't have to justify the cost of shows/rides and I feel it gives me a more objective viewpoint on things.  So here we go: This roller coaster sucks.  You are constantly being jolted back and forth, 0

My review comes not from personal golfing experience, 0
Will never go to this place again.  Gross is an understatement.  Had to send my dish back as it made McDonalds look good.  Strange atmosphere.  Don't reallyfeel like going on about this place as it sucked.  Just don't go., 0
Paul at the Dollar car rental falsified the rental agreement in order to force us to pay an additional $450 and the supervisor at the desk said that he is a great long time employee who did a great job and we would have to pay that additional amount.  Dollar investigated and said they found that it was falsified and they would contact that manager, 0
I had one of the most disappointing experiences at Cactus Moon in Mesa az on Sat night. From the time we stepped in the door the service was below average. It was like pulling teeth to get our first order in. This set the tone for the rest of the night. Finally after getting fed up and deciding to leave, 0
We chose to eat here after walking over and into "Old Montreal" after we attended the Indiana Jones exhibit at the Montreal Science Centre for a few hours and didn't feel like looking around long for a place to eat. Steak sounded good, 0
Food is ok service is terrible. God forbid u have to send something back! They treat you like crap.  Very disappointed, 0
This BofA can blow it out it's a$$!   Stood in line for over 30 minutes to withdraw MY money.  As I type these words, 0
Come in here spend money. Girlfriend has to use the bathroom and management says it's closed. So I ask them to open it and they won't, 0
All around bad. It started with the front counter saying no double non-smoking rooms were available. The person I  traveling with quit smoking so this just wasn't workable. Magically a room opened. Then later another one. The first room looked like no one has vacuumed in awhile and the hall carpets where loose and coming up like the entire floor has flooded (floor 4 North Tower). There was also bad mold in the bathroom. I called the front desk to see if I could at least pay for an upgrade and they sent me to a room that was better but had hair in the shower. Later found the heater does not work (during a cold season it was 40 degrees at night) and the shower gets room temperature at best. I wanted to get my money back and leave but there was a big convention and everything is booked.  The reason for two stars is location. While loud, 0
I had one sub-par meal there, 0

took my wife to get some oxtail and I got the goat which my wise is dominican and am half Dominican and puerto rican needless to say whe know what authentic is living in the country and also eating out allot and from up north when they finally bring the food out it was horrible no taste the oxtail was burnt my wife returned it and got the chicken same story the waitress agreed that it was burnt and without us saying said that the manager was not there to take it off the bill like we ask for that the waitress had a hang over from the previous night and not paying attention to anything bad service bad food and the price are just ridiculous will never go back to this place, 0
There are only two good things about staying at the MGM Grand hotel in Vegas. The location and the bed. First of all the super gay employee who checked us in had an attitude when he told us there was a $200 fee to check in and we only had cash. I had no idea of the fee to begin with. Then we were never able to log in with their WiFi connection. Super complicated and it never worked not even offline my phone couldnt connect. I dont know if they have a signal jammer or what. The walk to the room was half a mile. I guess we made the mistake of staying when that loser miley cyrus was booked so the hotel and the parking lot was jam packed with the fall of americas future clogging up the hallways, 0
This is the worst night ever, 0
I don't see what people like about this place. I visited during lunch, 0

I am sorry but after experiencing The Buffet at Aria wicked spoon does not compare. Bad selection food is just okay and I was disappointed with most of the food I ate. The chef at the omelet station needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to make an omelet., 0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine. To clarify, 0

If you want cheap pizza that tastes good go to Little Caesars 5 Bucks and your out the door! Unfortunately when I order here I get cold pizza looks like crap and comes with no peppers and cheese!  But ya I suppose you get what you pay for =), 0

Not the best. Ate here before the Pen and Teller show since had to plan day to get there.  We got there at 630 a d the wait line was atrocious!  I recommend that using cash or credit as there is no line for that, 0
Food is fresh.I'd compare it to Jimmy Johns but way more pricier.I paid 15$ for a California sandwich, 0
First they got my order wrong (#4 breakfast combo). It involved crediting my CC back, 0

I was suckered into overpaying for a ride.  What should have been a 10 minute ride took 45 and cost $50.  "Sammy" handed me a blank receipt claiming his printer didn't work for credit cards... the receipt was for a different cab company.    When I checked Google Maps, 0
I'm full and disappointed. I ordered shrimp egg foo young and crispy orange tofu. The egg foo young was burnt and even the sauce didn't saturate all of the burnt crispy edges. It was burnt, 0

This is the worst place we have EVER eaten!!!! That's all I have to say! Wait one more thing YUCK! I just threw up a little in my mouth after that horrible meal! Stay away! Treat it as if you would get A rash just for eating there., 0
NO VAPE, 0
Still haven't played there, 0
This location is absolutely ridiculous. I went with a friend to eat here when it first opened. Mind you it was her first time having barros and I told her how good they are, 0
I was not pleased with my meal at all. The salad rolls were obviously premade and refigerated because the rice paper was stiff and cold. The singapore noodles were a bit salty and rushed. Maybe next time I'll try the sushi., 0
I would not go back to this place, 0
never in my life have i been so happy to dine and dash before. i won't give a time it happened, 0
Congratulations, 0
Just went to Chili's last night for dinner.  My biggest complaint about this place is the service.  I know we had been seated in the restaurant for about 50 minutes before we got our food.  My glass of water was empty for the majority of the time (had to wait for the ice to melt to get any water).  Our waiter also kept changing.  Now to the food... The chips were not the warm oily chips that you expect from Chili's.  The chips were just typical and kind of dry.  The salsa was ice cold.    On the plus side the food was good.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was excellent.  Everyone else at the table liked their food too.  I just wish the food had came out a bit sooner.    Also, 0
Truly amazed at all the positive reviews, 0
The music was great, 0

My girlfriend loves french fries the way that the Soviets loved lines.  It's just part of who she is.  So, 0
I had high expectations for this place because of the reviews I read on Yelp among a reference from someone who is a regular here. When my friend & I arrived we helped right away which I liked because we had an appointment but once the lady started doing my nails I noticed she wasn't very friendly & was constantly giving my friend & I dirty looks. She also became upset when I asked her for something specific on my nails & this place isn't a high end place . I didn't like the treatment I got nor the attitude I received from the person assisting me I think she was the owner not sure she was sitting on the first table on the right when you walk in. I will never come here again because I am paying for someone to do my nails how I want them & I expect as a paying customer to not be given attitude ., 0
First and for most. It's awful when a breakfast place has crappy tasting coffee. The food portions are sort of small for the price you pay, 0
This Place SUCKS lets just put it at that they have a buffet going on and let me tell you that no service and honestly the food was. About a day old horrible food really sad I wasted my money here, 0
Very rude caucasian salesman ! I'm hispanic So I walk in the lady at desk doesn't say Hi another African American lady sees me and doesn't say Hi! So I'm already walked like 1/3 of the mall.

The view of the Valley from the foot of South Mountain?  Check.  Now here's the rest of the story.  It was our first visit there and over an hour wait was what it took before my wife and I were seated.  I knew it'd be a bit of an old western type place when we parked in the overly rocky, 0
Beware. Lousy food at a high price!!! What do you expect for airport food hu?  The burger was Raw, 0
We had a sweet heart of a waitress but when ours wasn't near we called Aimee who was working 5/11/12 close to mid night told us in a rude manner that she was not our waitress. Then latter on she walks by and tells us that "they ran out of food and they cant feed you" Really This chick needs to get out of the service business and find something that will fit her rude manner like WWF, 0
Plain and simple this place sucks! The food was disgusting and the waiter wasn't able to give me any details on what was on the menu. This so called high end restaurant had some stuck up hostess and waitress. I ordered a steak medium rare, 0
I don't usually write reviews for things like this but in this case I will make an exception. I have parked here numerous times and paid some amount of money almost every time. They have an option inside of the market where you can validate and get a free 1.5 hour of parking. I have used this option every single time I have been in the market without issue.  The other day my husband and I went in to get some coffee and have breakfast at local loaf and we were unable to get the validation machine to work. We tried before eating our breakfast and again when we were leaving. When we were leaving we checked the barcode and I thought it had added the small extra part on the end but we realized I was mistaken when we went to go pay and the total was coming up as $8 after only being there for just over an hour.  We decided to go on to our car and speak with the person working the pay booth on our way out as this made the most sense to us.  We drove up to the woman working the counter and explained to her that we had been unable to get the validator inside to work. She said she would look into it and then stepped out the booth and asked us how many times we had tried it. We told her we had tried no less than 5 times.  She then proceeded to walk over to a gentlemen sitting on a john deere golf cart listening to his iPod and talk with him. They were out of ear shot but he then took the ticket and began walking down to the market. She then told us to wait until he came back up. At this point everything seemed fine, 0
What a disappointment!   This was my first Tim Horton's.  Growing up in New England, 0
The hotel's only 4 elevators are pittifully slow (2 are usually out of service every time we've stayed).  My complaint was met with a "sorry you feel that way".  The elevators that are running have so many people in each, 0
The smell of the place took me off at the beginning of the experience. I was shocked-perhaps it was the carpet? No one was there but they still sat us in a far off corner which felt weird as well. We ordered their new pretzel burger which tasted good but was super greasy. I could not eat the whole thing because of the grease, 0
I would have given Courier Cafe five stars after having had a wonderful lunch last week and having had a delightful milkshake there this evening, 0

Worst food poisoning of my life by far. I did not have any alcohol in my system so that is not an excuse. I am vegetarian and ordered the Vegetable Fried Rice and asked the served when ordering whether or not the dish was fully vegetarian and she said yes. My boyfriend had a little of my vegetable fried rice and he is not vegetarian at all. 30 minutes after the meal he threw up. 20 minutes after him, 0

On a trip to Vegas a few months ago  we decided to give the stratosphere a try for our last night in town. Paid les than 100.00 for the oasis suite on Sunday night. We were looking forward to dinning at the Top of the world restaurant mainly for the view. Getting to the restaurant was somewhat of a challenge from the time we entered the elevator loading area on the main floor to the restaurant.  Had to ask for directions a couple a times. Once seated we began with their very taste bread basket and wine.   My wife ordered the ribeye and was fairly satisfied with it, 0
Horrible Management! GM will not take responsibility for his own mistakes is very rude when spoken to. He will completely ignore and interrupt you, 0
Moved here two months ago.  Got two bedroom apt for 12 month lease... BIG MISTAKE... My toilette has been flushing automatically since the day I moved in.  Maintenance seems not to know how to fix it.  Numbers of complains filed - NO ACTION taken by management.  Office staff is full of beautiful women but that is where it ENDS... Their PET policy is a JOKE... When I asked how strictly the pet policy is enforced - office staff laughed!  I got answer and I quote "...as long as pet is under 75 lbs - they are welcome" So I said and I quote "...So if I get 10ft tall mountain lion or wild cat - it doesn't matter as long as its under 75 lbs!"  Shocking answer.. "YES!!!!" - When I asked, 0

I used to LOVE this outlet store.  I have spent hundreds of dollars during my previous trips to Las Vegas here.  But now they have very little have discontinued Disneyland park merchandise in the store.  They said they may get some again around the holidays.  So sad, 0
Nothing epic here. Would rather go to a savers and that's saying something. Sure they are clean because they have nothing. Huge empty store. Mostly clothing with what looks like broken and parks of electronics and toys, 0

I stayed at this hotel back in 2010 so decided to come back because of the excellent rate and first experience that we had. Our second experience of this hotel  in 2012 was the worst experience I have ever had in my life.   We checked into our hotel and came to find out that the shower had little to no water pressure at all and the water temperature did not warm up. I wanted to make sure I wasn't just being crazy so I had my husband check it out as well. Low and behold it was not just me.   We called maintenance and it took them several hours to come to our room and look at it. Finally they said they could see the issue but he could not fix it and would need to call for an additional repair man. It took them an additional call and seven hours for them  to come up to our room and we had a show to attend that evening.   When the second maintenace man came up he said that the entire side of this hotel had the same issue. Our question at that point was, 0
Horrible experience. From the floorplan to the food, 0
Well I give this place 2 stars just for the fact that my boyfriend and I did not have to wait in line or pay and then maybe add 1/2 a star for the music mostly booty popping hip-hop.....  But like allot of people on here say they do just let anybody in here... Let's just say an older un-attractive demographic.  Will most likely not be back do your self a favor go to XS, 0
I was here once, 0
Ridiculously small portions for ridiculously high prices.  This is MEXICAN FOOD for gods sake!!!!  Do they realize how many knock-you-socks-off authentic Mexican food restaurants there are in the southwest???!!!!??  For a portion of the price!!!!  The pretty setting is a plus, 0
Ate here as we were at a conference and did not have a bunch of time in between sessions. It is just ok not great not horrible. The free popcorn was yummy and the perfect amount of salt. The chicken fingers I split with a coworker were extremely overcooked and dry. Ok when you are rushing between sessions., 0
wayyyy over rated. Just because they have had stars here they think its acceptable to charge evryone alot but not worth it. It was a beautiful club, 0
I called inquiring about kids BJJ belts. The guy on the phone was pleasant enough but didn't have a clue about sizing and thought the smallest size was a 0.  I realize that kids belts and gis are probably not a huge money maker for them but I think they should have a better idea of what they sell and what's available on the market. FWIW - kids sizes go down to 0000 which is considerably smaller than a 0., 0
It was alright. Had the lobster ravioli and flank steak. Honestly I can make a better ravioli than that hands down. And well the skirt steak. I'd had way better in Carne asada burritos. It is what it is. A glamorized steak house in vegas., 0

good service & clean but food was sub par.  we were disappointed & would prefer other cafes in the area over this one.  pancake were OK but potatoes and corn beef hash were dry & flavorless., 0
I took my dog here after she got bit and my normal  vet was closed. We waited in the waiting room with her skin hanging as some other pets made it back to an exam room. We finally made it back and after the vet visited he determined it was necessary to keep her overnight for surgery. I had to call the next day to she how she was, 0
This place really pisses me off.  Being in the food service industry in vegas for over ten yen years I find the plates here offensive.  In an attempt to defer their food cost. All the sushi you order has a ridiculous amount of rice on it so as to fill you up fast.  You incur more cost if you don't eat all your  rice at all you can eat restaurants. Fine. Charge me more up front.  I come to sushi, 0
Have bought probably 6+ Waterman Ballpoint pens here. I tend to lose them and give them as gifts. Was really happy to keep my business local as my office is a short walk away.   Stopped by the other day to see about getting the decorative silver tab replaced on my pen, 0

If you like hoppy beers this the place. Nice try but i like OMB better!, 0
This is hard to write because the food was so insanely delicious. However! My party waited for 45 minutes for a table despite the fact that we had reservations. No waitresses ever asked us if we wanted drinks while we were waiting. I had to go ask after 20 minutes if we could get drinks. They told me yes and to look for the waitress myself. The whole 45 minutes we waited she didn't bring all of us drinks. Some of us didn't even get our drinks till we were seated at our table eating appetizers. The waiter was not helpful whatsoever. Also, 0

Let's be honest... If you're not an attractive woman go to Pure. They let any woman in no matter how unattractive she is... FAIL!!!  Pure is one of the worst clubs I've been to in Vegas. I'm not talking about the music, 0
SO disappointed.  My husband and I went last night with our infant daughter (asleep in her carrier) and here is a rundown of how it went:  We were promptly greeted and asked by the hostess if we needed a carrier sling.  I declined and said I'd just tuck her carrier under the table by my leg.  The hostess then had a sub-hostess (?) come over and take us to our table.  She also asked if we needed a sling.  Again, 0
Roaches everywhere! Dead and alive! We got out of the restaurant even before we could place an order., 0
Disappointed with the food.It didn't taste good to me. The noodles were starchy and my order was swapped with another gentleman. There was not enough flavors to their stir fry.However I did like their dumplings with some hot sauce, 0

Did a lot of business with this company decided to have an order done somewhere else asked for the artwork that I paid for been getting the runaround for a week now wasn't thrilled with the product that I got originally but the people were nice and planned on doing future business with them based on the hassles and trying to get my own property back from them May have to rethink that   Will update good or bad.  Finally got my artwork after owner talking all kinds of crap to my partner about me because I'd ask for a price and didn't move forward with an order guys a jerk don't recommend doing business with them, 0

Just to make everyone aware living social IS giving refunds! I was emailed today and told mine would be available in 3-5 days so if you are as un happy with this company as we are please contact them!!  I called so many times to try and scheduled it was crazy! I wrote on Facebook, 0
If I could give Cox a rating of zero stars I would! The worst customer service I have experienced as far as an Internet Service provider. I called to make a payment so I dialed the main 800 number but because it was not for Residential Internet Service I was given a number in the automated system to dial. Whatever happened to automatic transfer of phone calls? Then when I try to make a payment they say I will be charged an extra $10 if made through a representative? WTF? Canceling service as soon as I can., 0

Took my car in for service at Berge and had a horrible experience. This was the first time I have used the dealership and was completely disappointed with the whole event. Not only did they not repair my car properly they provided zero help in a solution. They were rude and took every opportunity to bad mouth the dealership i bought my car from.   What should have been a simple CV boot repair has left me stranded with no car for the weekend and will either cost me a full day of work or the cost of a rental car. Not including the aggravation of dealing with their poor customer service.   I know VW is better than this, 0

I'm still looking for a GREAT burger.  I cant find one.  Ill review ZinBurger next.    This place is okay.  The fries are good, 0
Service was mediocre at best. Food presentation was excellent although the cook must not know that teriyaki is a marinade instead of a topping. Chicken was the same but at least they use real chicken instead of precooked like some others. Atmosphere seemed Hawaiian when we walked in right up to when they had the local hip-hop station playing instead of one of the many Hawaiian radio stations available online for free. Prices were about right and I would go back if the other Hawaiian places were packed. No smiles, 0

It was our first time trying poutine. It was also our last time. So much hype about poutine and everytone said go to la banquise. but it was soggy french fries covered in a sweetish gravy with salty cheese curds. HUH? Should we have been plastered to appreciate this novelty? Such a bummer, 0
Let me start off by saying that the alterations weren't horrible, 0
Sadly today this location FAILED. To be clear they comp'd the meal, 0
Horrible how the hell do you lose my package when I'm less then 10 mins away from your facility? Also the driver marked it was delivered twice for some reason. I wasted a whole day with these people and the weren't even sure if the driver even dropped it off at all and supposed the driver lost it. After a 2 minute call with Amazon they were very familiar with OnTrac's inconsistencies and gave me an instant refund. They ruined my first and last Amazon experience. Looks like I'm going back to eBay and ups., 0
This would have been a 4 star review until the 90 minute wait at the valet. I get it, 0
I accidentally stumbled into this place while trying to get to another pizza place that is right down the street and it sure was a bad mistake. The theme here is kinda like night club meets dirty strip bar with shitty house music and terrible decor. The staff just left me standing at the counter for like five minutes before taking my order and when I got the Za's they where greasy as hell, 0
Over this place was VERY disappointing.  I went in with high expectations for delicious hamburgers and left feeling unsatisfied. lets first start off with the horrible customer service.we we're sat at a table and I asked the server if we could possibly be seated at the booth he rudely  said  those we we're being saved for larger parties.  After looking around and saw that they weren't very busy I thought that wasn't right. Our waiter then disappeared when I looked around the place I notice most people we're still waiting and that multiple servers we're just standing huddled up conversations.   All in all very disappointed!, 0
This store looked much better than the one we went to on Twain - at least on the outside.  But don't let the facelift fool you - it is filthy inside - dust on the shelves and dirt on the floor.  It was so gross than I wouldn't even shop here.  Try Fresh and Easy - that's what we did.  Vons/Safeway - clean up your Vegas stores!, 0
Would be so much better if they did not cook the cheap pasta into mush. I want to like it, 0

I wish I could give this place 0 stars! It was absolutely disgusting! There was a bowl of melted ice cream that overflowed all over one of the tables and debris on many of the other tables. There were 4 teens working and 2 looked like they were working on custom cakes and one who was apparently the store manager doing absolutely nothing even though there were a few people in line. We ha to wait for the only girl that was apparently helping customers finish with her last order. We asked to speak with the store manager of which the one who was doing nothing said she was. We advised her that the lobby/ eating area was completely disgusting and that we had literally lost our appetites sitting there looking around. She was very insincere when apologizing and did not offer to do anything. She didn't even clean up the mess. I also noticed that another worker was drinking a can of coke as be was making these custom orders, 0
This place is terrible. I do not suggest coming this buffet at all! I would be nice because it is a new place but I'm not! The food is nasty, 0
Well after a long 14 HR. Day at work I wanted to grab something fast and easy...  well not fast at all in fact a little over 10 min just to get too the food.  I can handle that. But when I went home too eat my food there was hair.  I called the manager to confront her about it...  the answer I got was I don't know how that happened. We don't have anyone with long hair working the grill. I was offered to have the food remade but between the wait, 0
I have been here a few times in the past but not in years.  The other day I stopped in to grab lunch at 1:20pm and was put on a wait list 5 groups long.  The most frustrating part was that their were 5 tables open inside and a full open patio outside.  The cooks were twiddling their thumbs with nothing to do and there were easily 4 employees total just kinda hanging out.  I waited 15 minutes thinking there had to be a reason we couldn't sit in these empty tables and at least sip on an ice tea... but there was not, 0
disappointing. we asked the waitress for suggestions and she provided a couple of suggestions including the "starred" pollo margarita. waitress recommendation, 0

Worst massage EVER! They were 5 minutes late and had me leave 5 minutes early(Sounds like less than an hour). Then I asked for a deep tissue massage and they gave me a little dainty chick that couldn't squash a grape in a fruit fight! And then when it's all done you get to head back to the lobby and get the biggest sales pitch of your life. NEWS FLASH... You can get $40 massage's all day on groupon. There are better places you just have to look., 0

Not a huge fan. The food always seems cold.   We had a double cheeseburger meal with tots. it was ok.   The best thing about Sonic is... hmmm.... ?  We ate there since it was nice out. I don't like ordering from a wall it seems dumb since the people are 10 feet away, 0
I came here for my annual health-insurance work screening. What a pain.  They scheduled to come into our office the day before Labor day and since I was going on vacation I had to make the lunch trek to their office. As to why they planned it that particular day I have no idea...let's make it so as many people are not in the office as possible.  I get there at my reserved time and the place is slammed...as in, 0
My husband and I stopped for a late lunch today and will never eat at this restaurant again. We ordered our food and sat down in the dining room to wait for it to be brought to us. There were very few people in the restaurant and all had their food so we knew ours should not take long. After about 18-20 minutes our food was sat up in the pass through window by the cooks and just sat there. The cashier was in the lobby at that point emptying trash and there was no one else out front to bring us our food. As we sat we witnessed a female employee come from the kitchen with a paper towel or tissue in her hand. She BLEW AND WIPED HER NOSE and threw the tissue in the trash can under the counter and then immediately reached up and grabbed our plates of food with her dirty hands. She reached in and scooped cole slaw onto our plates contaminating the entire batch sitting there and proceeded to walk to our table with the contaminated food. We refused it and demanded a refund immediately asking to speak to the manager. The manager never came out and I left but not before getting the number of the district manager for Long John Slivers. I have contacted her and the health department with a complaint. Do not eat at this restaurant., 0
We booked this based on reviews that were not accurate. Very seedy run down hotel with rude staff, 0

This is a restaurant that has a lot of potential but right now is veryyyyyyy much missing the mark.  first if you're doing Thai you night want to commit to the theme.  I like football but if you want to be a sports bar be a sports bar.  if you want to be a thai restaurant maybe play some asian music?  now on the service.  my girlfriend was given a plate with a hair on it.  probably our waitress.  glad I caught it.  but you gotta be careful of that sort of thing.  only one waitress for the whole restaurant buuuut she only had 3 tables so no excuse for being swamped.  water tasted bad obviously from the tap.  had to ask for refill of thai tea.  took 10 minutes to come.  at the end of the meal.  also the waitress didnt buss a single plate the entire evening so by the end was pretty cluttered.  then comes the creepy buss boy wearing a jack daniels t shirt.  he says 'dont worry i actually do work here' who goes on to explain 'i get it all the time.'  wellllll have you tried maybe wearing a uniform?  trying to be professional?  or at least not creepy and in your face?  to be fair he WAS trying.  but i'd say its the waitresses' job to be friendly and whitty.  not the buss boy.  he could actually be a very good employee if properly trained.  but it seemed like he was the only one who was really trying.  an inattentive waitress.  an over the top buss boy.  another guy who helps with the drinks but when we ask for more rice says 'tell your waitress'  this place is all kinds of mismanaged.  clean up your over enthusiastic buss boy.  put a proper uniform on him and you could have yourself a good waiter.  BEAUTIFUL decorations complete with Buddha statue.  so like I said.  a lot of potential.  but confused on their identity.  and obviously lacking in leadership.  needs better service.  be fast on the drinks.  refills.  clear dishes as they empty dont let them just pile up.  and add some music and commit to your theme and you'll turn this confused experience into one of the cutest and authentic thai restaurants in tempe., 0
The pho's a bit pricey and they're very short on selection variety. And it's even worse because the size of the pho was tiny. I needed a magnifying glass to see it! Just kidding. But you get what I mean.  It was edible and okay at the least, 0
Let me start by saying I have never ever written a review. I am doing so because of how terrible my experience was. OK so I will say the rooms are huge and for the price, 0
Yuck. Salty low grade beef with under cooked bacon wet bun and terrible onion rings.  The place smelt like the sewer backed up and the waitress had 3 tables and took way longer than she should have.  Never again., 0
This place is a shit hole! Food was not good and there was hair in it! Nasty! And to top it all off the people working were very rude! Would not recommend it unless you had zero taste buds and could not hear or see...., 0
Rubios food is always great, 0
Not thrilled with this theater.  Staff were too involved with each other and not with customers waiting to ask questions.  Felt more like they did not want to be there.  Poor customer service.  The theater was also very warm.  The popcorn and hot dog tasted like they were sitting around for awhile., 0
Once again my friends wanted to come here to my dismay. They don't let us in because someone is wearing "high top" sneakers. No dress code anywhere but they always want to turn people away because of random selections of clothing., 0

The meal was not fresh.  We ordered the Cowboy Stuff and most of the meal seemed to have been cooking all day.  The bbq chicken was dry and tough to eat.  The ribs were also dry.  Both of the kabobs were much better than the rest of the meal.  Even the garnish and cru de te was old.  The lettuce garnish was dried out crispy, 0
First time last night. I loved the BBQ sauce. The lack of cleanliness & no plates turned me off.  The restaurant needs to train its employees to clean with a disinfectant between customer on the tables, 0

This used to be the best buffet in Las Vegas.  Not any more.  The food has been bad the last three times I have been.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the setting is beautiful and the staff is usually good (although I have had bad service here in the past).  Interesting that the place has been empty the last few times.  Please improve the food!  Your guests deserve better food than the garbage you have been serving.  Why pay over $40 to have dinner here when you can have the same mediocre meal for less than half the price elsewhere., 0

I had worked up quite the appetite after spending the day in the Sportsbook experiencing march madness so headed to the cafe for a burger.    The 100% angus burger with fries should have hit the spot.  I would have been better off going to mcdonalds.  The burger patty had absolutely no taste and was clearly a frozen patty.  The bun was huge resulting a a poor bun to huger ratio.  Fries do not come with the burger so i expected I nice sized portion but only a small plate was served.   I expected more from the Wynn than a frozen tasteless burger., 0
Everything was too salty. But it does feel nice to be sitting in this indoor-that-feels-like-an-outdoor type of environment. And they did rush our order since we told them we had a plane to catch. Service was not bad., 0
Great food but terrible take out service.   It's weird when a place has perfect pizza but terrible service.   I ordered a large pie for takeout. 30 minutes later I'm there to pick it up and it's not ready. No problem, 0

Okay people listen to me! As you can see some of these reviews are okay and some are very bad. Let me first mention this in my review; Anyone who comes here because Eva Longoria is the owner is out of their mind. You wouldn't know good acting let alone good food if it sat on your face! People...she is not a cook! She is an actress (word used lightly)!   My wife and I were at Beso at 8PM on Saturday night. Marky Mark was our waiter (yes he looked just like him which thrilled my wife) and although he was a nice guy he belonged behind the bar at an Outback Steakhouse. Just not very professional and in over his head with a higher end menu. I ordered the Foie Gras as an app. For those of you who have never experienced enlarged/fatten duck liver, 0

Food was a-OK..not bad...; We ordered take out and it was nice to have parking spaces up front for the take out orders. Hubby ordered the sea clams and specifically asked for two sauces - the red sauce and the tartar sauce.  The host said they always put the two sauces in there.  We got home and there was only the red sauce.  I called them and I told the host that the hubby was not happy....she laughs.... This was the SECOND time!  and to have a the host laugh at the situation did not help.   I had the mussels in the garlic white wine sauce which was tasty and plentiful.  I also ordered the hearty house salad. The low rating was due to the host laughing at us.... what was that all about???, 0
This is by far the worst food I have ever had in my existence. The chicken tastes like boiled "meat ?" and is absolutely disgusting.  We ordered several items to bring back to a family party.  I was so embarrassed by what I served.  I had to apologize to everyone for the horrible dinner and we ended up ordering pizza.  Do not waste your money on this nasty food., 0
Someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down. A large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful. The stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel. The cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can and there was nothing special about the bread. The upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot., 0
OK so like everything in the Wynn it's gorgeous, 0
Came here on a referral from a friend. It is close to my home. I've had really bad luck finding a meticulous manicurist here in Vegas. I gave it 2 stars only because of the overwhelming acrylic smell that hits you at the door. I received a mani pedi and it was ok.  The pedicure lasted a full hour and super relaxing.  Nail tech was very nice.., 0
This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, 0

Service: the service was good. Other than waiting a few for a hostess the service was good. Our waiter was attentative and polite.  Food: food was subpar. The oysters had shells on them which normally isn't a big deal but they were baked and covered with cheese so it was a nice suprise.  The salad was awesome. The highlight of the meal.  The tilapia Bianca was flavorless.  The grilled shrimp skewer with rice pilaf was flavorless as well.  Atmosphere: nice atmosphere. Good music. Nice seating. Clean dining area. Good decor for the theme. I enjoyed the dining experience overall.  Conclusion: come here for a few drinks and some dessert. This place should not be a main course visit but more a drinks with friends as a night cap or a pre night out stop., 0

Decided to eat here before heading back to Long Beach based on the 4 star review on Yelp.   I honestly can not figure out how this got an overall rating of 4 stars.

Extremely disappointed in the service here . After driving for 30 minutes to get to this doughnut shop our friend convinced us to get up and go to we were left with a selection of 3 different types of doughnuts . We told them it was our first time and how far we had driven to come in . All we were told was oh well it's national doughnut day you should have come earlier . No coupon to get us to come back and I'm assuming the older man who opened the door for us was the owner and unlike one of the reviews where he gave them a free doughnut to try no offer or even attempt was made to make our trip worth it .   The reason I'm giving it 2 stars was because of the actual donut, 0

We came here after seeing 4 stars on yelp. We must have come on a really bad night. This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had. The hot & sour soup was too spicy to eat and I could only taste pepper. The fried shrimp & egg roll with the meal was swimming in grease-very old grease. We took about two bites of our orange chicken and sweet & sour chicken before deciding it was too gross to eat. It only gets 2 stars because the workers were super nice!, 0
Ate here once about a month ago. I thought the food was great so I decided to return for lunch with friends. Arrived and the wait was 1 hour. That's fine no problem. Waited 1.5 hours then the hostess told me the chef said not to seat us. Don't you think they should have told us that before we waited over an hour. This place is very popular but it won't be for long if they do this to people., 0

I grew up on Burrito Express and when I moved away I missed it. When I had the chance to eat at this location I ordered and handed the guy my card and he informs me that they do not take cards and points to a small sign on the bottom of the cash register. That was the only sign. He tells me that I can use the ATM in the store. I told him that I will not pay three dollars extra for my meal. The Internet says they accept cards, 0

I was in the area running errands and needed a light bite to eat. I had never eaten at Yummy Grill Sushi before and it had an overall score of 4 stars on Yelp so I figured it was worth a try. Mistake on my part! I am guessing the majority of the high-star reviews are for the cooked food that YGS offers.   I had a lemonade, 0

I have NEVER written a review for yelp BUT because today's experience has happened 7 times already I had to.

Nothing to write home about.  The traditional spring rolls were dry and didn't have much taste to them.  The combination sandwich was decent but odd combination to have a side of fries or sweet potato fries with it. The Saigon Bun was okay - the dressing was tasty but too many dry noodles, 0
The selection of stores is just okay. However the layout is not good. For most people accessing both sides for the stores or theatre they will find that they prefer to move their vehicle than cross to the furthest side by foot through a massive parking lot.

the food is really great good drinks  but terrible atmosphere the music so loud the waiters cant even hear you i work in clubs and their music is alot overpowering than anywhere ive been not good i understand the loungy feeling they want to put out but not to the point its uncomfortable i had their foie gras french toast which was amazing and i think i tried mac and cheese too i ended up leaving and sitting outside and had my meal packed to go i couldnt take the music and i got a migraine. they could do better. the food is amazing but i would never come here again for the sole purpose of the environment. we did ask the waiter if they could lower it a tad bit but if they did it was highly unnoticeable, 0
Not really thrilled with this place.  I expected more of an interesting beer selection.  The food was good but nothing to rave about.  Our salads and entrees arrived back to back which I was not thrilled about.  The inside was nice and the staff friendly.  My husband and I agreed that it was not good enough to go back to., 0

I wanted to try this hotel because I thought the design was neat. I have never stayed here and the price was pretty good.   I liked the gambling area and the restaurant area was cute. Looked like you were walking on a street through a neighborhood with trees and everything.   We stayed in a Broadway room. You have to be careful when you book that you are not put in a room with pink windows. I was warned of this before we booked because apparently your whole room is pink all the time.   The room was pretty spacious. Unfortunately it did have a big column in the room that blocked part of our view. You do get two big windows though.   I know you don't go Vegas to watch t.v. but when it's late and you just want to fall asleep to it you want it to work. It's a small junky old t.v. Keep your little kids away from it because it's really loose on the little swivel thing that holds it. The remote had a mind of it's own. It didn't matter what you pressed on the remote it just went all over the place. Plus you had to use your muscles to even get it to work at all. Then, 0

I was there over an hot and my second lunch of chimi came out and it was colder than the first. The bar tender did not want to charge me for anything and did an amazing job. I made him charge me for something so I could tip him as I did not have cash.  This was by far the best bar tender, 0

This is not a gastro pub. The food all tastes as if it was previously frozen. The bread was not baked recently and the fries reminded me of my grade school cafeteria fries.

I saw the pizza and fries sitting on top of the oven and I knew we were waiting for the Calzone. When we got home the fries were warm and soggy and the cheese on the pizza had started to harden. The Calzone was flat and under cooked. This is the 3rd and final time I go here, 0

Sorry...but this restaurant is absolutely disgusting.  I went with 4 friends and every single person left the restaurant without eating more than a few bites.   I don't know how they make their gravy but it tasted old and maybe spoiled.  The Chicken and Waffles sounded great...but the chicken was dry and the bacon in the waffle was flavorless.   Yeah the portions are huge...but there are literally a hundred places in Vegas that serve a better breakfast.  Even Denny's is far superior., 0

i have to admit I am pretty sad after my first few times here. I went over the holidays and found that the place was bought out. They changed the prices which was uncomfortable at the end. The stylists are still there but it was just different. Of course we all know you choose a salon based on the stylist not the place but after paying a great price I am not interested in the price hike. sorry :(, 0

Let me start by saying the food was amazing! Best ribs I've had yet and really great baked beans. Nice environment with a great open strip view.

When I first checked into the hotel everything was excellent! We were offered an upgrade for a decent price. My mom has a medical problem and we were given a complimentary refrigerator for it which they sent up very quickly. The stay was really good everyone that worked in the shops were really nice helpful and respectful. I lost my credit card in the hotel and it was returned my a staff member. I had to wait about an hour at the front desk because the Supervisor was caught up in something but the Security guard that was there was real nice and funny and kept me entertained. We then went to see the show Pin-up which everyone recommended not to see and I now know why. We arrived 25 min early and greeted by a really nice lady and seated. They were going around serving drinks in sections. They went to every section but the 10 of us in our section we waited about an hour into the show before I went up there and asked when we were receiving a server to order drinks they then came over about 6 min later and asked what we wanted but by then the show had 10 more min left. The show was very dry and not very entertaining. The housekeeping who took care of room was really nice. Towards the end of my stay the refrigerator that was given to us froze my moms medication. We figured that the medicine was ruined because it says do not freeze but she still needed to take it till we got home just in case. So we let it defrost and checked the temperature to make sure that it some how wasn't moved to a colder setting which it wasn't. We didn't tell any staff about it that day. The next night she goes to put in her medication for her eyes and it was half way frozen but was able to get out some drops. We then called the room service in the morning because we were going to sleep. In the conversation with the front desk at 10am we were told that housekeeping will be up with a refrigerator. Security came up and did a report who he was really nice and answered everything that he can. And also stated that housekeeping will be up. We waited about half hour and left thinking by the time we come back it will be changed out. We got back into the hotel at 1:53am and it was still the same refrigerator with my moms medication frozen again. We called front desk wondering why one never came up. They stated they didnt know why and they will call housekeeping but we didnt need a new one we were leaving in 5 hours. I then called housekeeping which I waited on hold for 8 min and then received a housekeeper that says that she guesses that she is a little busy and the front desk cancelled the order thats why it never came. And decides to get really rude when I start asking her questions. I called the front desk and spoke with Carol who was really helpful and concerned with the situation and didn't really know what to say and was relaying messages from her Supervisor. I then became very Irate because it seemed like nobody is concerned about my moms well being. I told her that I would be down there shortly to speak with them face to face. At this point in time I no longer wanted to spend money in Stratosphere. I came downstairs very hostile were Julio the supervisor explained that I needed to calm down or I would be escorted off the premises. I did and he was very helpful nice and understanding and Comped our night and Resort fee. I then apologized to him and Carol for anything that I did to offend or disrespect them. The Security officer Mr.Ellis was very helpful and concerned as well. 5 hours later when its time to checkout which we were told we can do on our TV wouldn't let us. When i get down to the front desk there were 3 clerks all busy with a 4 more people ahead of me. When I finally get to the desk I told him that we were checking out and he said that in order for me to get that money I had to wait for him to do the math and paperwork. Because I waited i then missed my shuttle to the airport and had to wait an hour for the next one!, 0

I was not pleased with my experience at this salon.  First I purchased a groupon for $39.00 for a cut and partial highlights.  I had my hair died dark so the highlights would stand out.

He asked if it were to be shoulder length and I said yes.  I like my hair messy, 0

The worst.  Rude servers and hostess' plus the service takes forever to get anything.  The place is run down and smells of food that has been sitting for a while or even gone bad.  I'd rather travel to the next location than eat here again.  It's worth the drive to go to another location., 0

Unless you are a hard core Hershey's fan then this store is just like the Coke store or the M&M store over priced and over rated. Not that much to it. Just a place full of all things Hershey's it would be cooler if it had a Hershey's waterfall or something over the top. I rather go to walgreens and get everything I can get here for more then half the price. Unless you got money to burn then don't bother $10 dollars cupcakes and expensive Hershey's clothing that I don't care to wear unless I worked there and had too. Who in the world would wear Hershey's clothing anyway... "Weird!" The cases full of goodies are tempting but not for that price. It you are a due hard fan then check it out if not don't bother!, 0
Food was just ok not as good as all the hype. The service on Saturday Oct. 27th at around 4:00pm. After waiting for 15 min and still no drink we had to flag someone down to ask why and were told changing keg. When beer finely arrived was warm and smelled rotten. After taking our order we never saw the waiter again. Food was brought out by someone else and after waiting for 20 min after finishing our meal we had to ask someone to try and track down our waiter who I could see from our table B.S.ing with his buddy in the back room even after he was told we wanted our check he still stood talking with his buddy for another 5min until I got out of my chair and had to go to the back room to get my check.   I know things can happen and staff can get busy however after speaking with the manager she and both of the waiters laughed it off as on big deal. Food came slow service not at all and very pricey. I'll not be back., 0

After about 10 minutes on the phone the reservation was found and he assured me it was set.  Well, 0
Just moved into the neighborhood and came to check this place out because they sent over a flyer. We walked in and were sat within 3 minutes. The food and drinks looked great! We were excited because there was still 15 min left of happy hour. Little did I know that we would sit for the next 15 minutes at our table without anyone coming by. I tried to grab someone's attention but every time they just dodged me. We walked out and headed next door. If your busy it's understandable but at least bring by a water and greet the table. It's very rude and unprofessional to let a table sit for 15 min without acknowledging them. The Main Ingredient next door has been a much better experience., 0
I don't know what the appeal of this place is..it has almost 900 reviews    ( at the time of me writing this review)...and a four star rating...and it was such a disappointment. I think people that eat here mainly go to eat out on the terrace and people-watch. Sole redeeming factor- great fries., 0

Casino: plenty of new games to keep players amused both old and new. The two floor layout means the upper level tends to get less smokey. Lack of washroom facilities (there's only one near the check-in desk) on the ground floor can be problematic for those playing on the far side.  Restaurants: Ground floor McDonald's and a Krispy Creme. Upper level a Steak House (which has been closed every time we visit for the last five years.. we must have terrible timing lol..) and an open restaurant that has a buffet for some meals and also menu ordering.    Other: Nice that it's on the Fremont Street Experience. Parking is free for guests, 0
Stopped in today after church for lunch. Liked the patio feel of the place. Food was decent Service very spotty and took forever for the food to come. One of us ordered the roast sandwich. When it was over 30 minutes for the order, 0
Their billing policies are inconsistent.  I got to the check out area and she said my bill was $789, 0
Well I was SUPER excited to go try WS because of all the hype, 0
This  place is very efficient at extracting money from customers.  The first thing that irritated me is that they wanted $84 for an hour's labor to diagonse why one of the back doors wouldn't open from the outside.  (Any repairs would cost extra.  They failed me on my safety inspection, 0
I came here for a late lunch/early dinner. There was one party of people in front of me and most of the restaurant was empty but there was still about a 10 minute wait. The d\u00e9cor is somewhat sad when you think of a place that is in a hotel like Aria. The d\u00e9cor looked old and faded with scuff marks all round. While the view was pretty I was seated at a table that had the sun shining directly in my face and there are no window shades.   We ordered the Fish & Chips and the Jambalaya Pasta. I have to say that the Fish & Chips was kind of a mess with the batter being kind of soggy and the fries just kinda bland. It wasn't worth the $22 bucks that it costs except for that it was a rather large portion. The Jambalaya pasta was another large portion and was decent but again nothing overly wonderful. The chicken in it was a bit dry and it was swimming in sauce. That dish was also $22 bucks but again wasn't really worth the money.    We finished eating and didn't even want to bother taking our left overs. So we paid and got out as quickly as possible. I usually think that hotel coffee shops are pretty much the same with sub-par food and this one was the same. Which I think is a shame since there are so many other higher quality eateries in the Aria to choose from. You're better off grabbing some coffee and a pastry from Jean Philippe Patisserie., 0
I refuse to eat at a places where the staff is rude. The very first person I encountered when I walked in the door had an attitude problem (the hostess). So we turned around and walked out the door. I don't care if the foods good. There's tons of great places to eat in Charlotte with friendly staff., 0

Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, 0
I can't find one good thing to say about this particular store. I've been in a handful of times and if the service isn't poor, 0
I'll make this short and sweet...  Don't waste your money. Service is average at best. I got the impression that this was supposed to be a steakhouse. To be honest I've had better steak at Outback. Overpriced, 0
Costa vida can be good the problem is that it's not constantly good. Also the pricing is confusing and if you ask the employes (ex. Does a side of sour cream cost anything?) all of them will give you a different answer. I like the pork but a lot of the time it is hardly shredded at all., 0
The first time I went here was for a pedicure and it was excellent! The tubs were clean and sanitized, 0
Our first time trying this place and we will never go back again! Service was terrible and food took forever to come out. They screwed up our order and my daughter never received her food. Orders came out separately and half of our table was done before the other half ever got their food. Always had to track down wait staff to get help. Food was ok but we've had better at Saigon 8 on spring mountain.  When I complained about the service they seemed to not care and never apologized about the problems. I will never recommend this place to others., 0

I love the 5 and diner over by the 10 off Ray Road ans so we decided to check out this one at the Chandler Mall.  A disastrous breakfast decision. While the service was friendly enough the food was terrible. I have no idea how one location can be so bad compared to another a few miles away but we will never come back here.  There were hardly any diners on a Sunday morning when most other breakfast joints are jammed so I guess that should have been a warning sign from the beginning., 0
I worked here when they first opened up. I left because I couldn't stand to work for a place that takes no real pride in what they do. Beer from a bottle into a dirty glass? Not to mention the glass doesn't hold the entire beer, 0
People giving this any more than 1-2 stars need to have their heads checked (both for service and for food quality).  Ate here on an evening and food was starchy, 0
I noticed this place open up around the holidays.  It seemed to be dead whenever I passed it so I wanted to stop by and give them my business.   Plus, 0
Room service cleaned our room and took sheets off the bed not replacing them. Nothing like coming back from a 12 hour trade show day to find yourself with just a single sheet (fitted sheet missing from bed????) and a blanket. The sheets that were on the beds did not fit to start with, 0

Wanted to get my hair done for a work party! Re-grand opening so i called at 11:10am and scheduled an apt for 3pm!  One of my big pet peeves is people who don't show up early (that goes for anything) and letting a client (also goes for anything/anywhere) sit and wait with out any update is not good service.  I arrive at 2:35ish and check in with the girl at the counter she calls the back and says I'm here, 0
The pizza was not what I expected. I expected fresh ingredients, 0
The waitress was great! The space was interesting!  The food was practicably inedible. Probably the worst pizza I've had in ages and the Pastas for the most part don't have a red sauce.  The one we had  we had between the two of us could barely make a dent in it.  I would say this would be a alternative to taking kids to Micky D's.  the pricing structure doesn't make sense.  Cheap pastas, 0

Worst experience! Guy who did my nails was VERY RUDE.  Polish all over my fingers and under nails still dirty. Color selection is sparse at best. No glitter! I am going back tomorrow and ask for a do over. Beware!!  UPDATE Went back today and was treated like I was scum. Don't worry I will take my money to people who WANT my business and have good customer service! Wish I could do 0 stars!, 0
You get what you pay for and this place is very affordable.   If I'm drunk and feeling cheap the place is pretty ok for delivery; but dead sober it's a disappointment.   I've ordered a few times and there is a good hit or miss factor., 0

I really don't know how all those people up there are saying this food is amazing. It's garbage. The pizza is good if you're drunk and hungry and nobody else is delivering. I've ordered from them at like 1 in the morning because I really wanted pizza and decided they were the only ones open. Be that as it may, 0
The incompetent girl taking pizza orders for delivery last night clearly sucks at her job. She said her delivery driver was outside my place calling me several times and even left a message. Prove it. We waited an hour and she didn't think to try calling the number as well? Instead she just cancelled my order all together. I know for a fact I gave her the correct phone number. It definitely wasn't a mistake on my behalf that's for damn sure. I recommend you don't go here. EVER. She hung up on me and blamed me for it. Unreal. Customer service here blows. She didn't even try and make it right and send me a new one. Go to Z Pizza, 0

I just called the Salon for the first time. The person who answered the phone was so rude. She yelled over me "PLEASE HOLD" before I could even speak a word. I was on hold for five minutes. I called back. I was trying to get a price on color and she put me on hold three more times and cut me off anytime I tried to speak. I finally had to hang up because I couldn't take the rudeness.  This girl really needs to work on her customer service skills! Not a good representation for Aveda!, 0

We had recently stayed at the Luxor over the Christmas holiday week. I had personally stayed at this property in Oct 2001. Back then I was in awe of this marvel of architecture; this time not so much. We had booked into the pyramid and at check in the clerk told us she was upgrading us to the tower due to being sold out in the pyramid. It is my understanding that the pyramid rooms are under renovation and we were lucky to be in the tower. I will agree to the tower being nice our room was clean and newly renovated. We passed by some pyramid rooms and saw peeling wall paper and the rooms were just plain wore out. Overall the entire hotel/casino is wore out IMHO. If you pay attention you will see the dirt everywhere. We will never stay here again; there are just too many options available. The draw backs are the same as other reviews in here but the MAJOR DRAWBACK in the rooms walls are, 0
Bad food and service AND they try to cheat you on the tip!  I should have listened to other Yelp reviews but I was craving some of the menu items that you can't find in other places.  The food was mediocre to bad and the portions are small for the price they charge.  The soy sauce soy milk had a burnt taste; sesame pancake was hard; I won't go on.   When I received the check, 0
My appointment was for glasses.  I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.  Their frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, 0

I recently went to Abuelos because it was in the middle of where I live and where the people we were meeting live. I was not particularly impressed. The food was bland and was not very good. The salad was awful - it was basically lettuce smothered in cheese and beans and had a weird taste to it. The tortilla chowder also had a strange taste and I could only eat a few bites. The others at my table said their food was just ok - they ordered burritos and fajitas.  The only redeeming thing about going there was the delicious margaritas! I got the Island - with coconut - it was delightful. Otherwise, 0

Wanted to go to Sakana and it was packed .  Went to Blue Wasabi and the fact that it was not even filled up should have been a warning. Over priced!!  The tuna poke was $17 and came in a small martini glass that was filled with lettuce.  The specialty rolls had so much rice that I left feeling like I ate a bowl of rice.  The service was good., 0
The first time we went to Gordon Biersch was right after they opened, 0
This buffet needs to be updated. I have been going to Main Street Hotel and Casino for about 15 years. The only thing I really love about the place is the microbrews.  I went to the buffet last night and it was $12.99 with your players card. The line was long. Took about 20 minutes to get seated.  The food is basically the same stuff they have been serving for the last 15 years I have been going there. Everything is average at best. The food is very fatty and not the choicest cuts of meat. I spent more time waiting in line to eat than I actually did eating. The service sucked. I got one drink (and it was completely full of ice) and no refills.  Step up the quality of food Main Street. I am no longer eating there again!, 0

Was excited to check out Vegas Indian food. Saw some good reviews but I'm at home watching football so I ordered a delivery. A little hard ordering because I had to repeat myself the same thing several times. Not a problem though. I actually consider that to be a good sign because it means it's authentic if the one on the phone must be the best speaker of English. After a little struggling while ordering I asked the price because the guy was about to hang up without saying it. All I ordered was chicken bartha rice and garlic naan. I told the guy I only had $40 so if they don't take a card, 0

I was so excited to try the dinner buffet at the Wynn.  I've had lunch there before and it was great.  We waited in line for a little over an hour but i figured it would be well worth the wait.  Everyone at the Wynn is super friendly and the customer service is excellent.  However, 0
Don't expect to have any conversation with your fellow diners. So loud in there. Made me wonder- is this place a nightclub or is it a restaurant?  Fine either way but owners should make it one or the other   Food is nothing to write home about. Fish tacos were greasy and carnitas had chunks of fat in them. Salsa and ceviche were very good.   Speaking of salsa. If you want it you have to pay for it. What decent Mexican restaurant out there charges for chips and salsa?  Beans and rice are also a la carte and are not included with your meal.   If you are looking for a fun loud nightclub I recommend this place. Don't go there expecting a memorable dining experience., 0
Logans roadhouse is a total waste of money. I can make a better steak in the comfort of my home and be in a comfortable not grungy cheap environment like this place.  I always dread when my boyfriends sisters parents choose this place over chilis.  The "high quality" steaks are so rough and disgusting.  I should be a steak connoisseur between my brother and I on how much actual Good steak we have ate since we were young we should be on a show to grade steak.    Short and simple...Do NOT waste your money here.  Unless you like cheap low budget steak this is your place ill spend an extra 20 and a get a real steak at a real Steak house, 0

Was really looking forward to the food here and a little disappointed. I do have to say that we tried the gingered sweet potato and pumpkin soup and loved it! The tostones were deep deep fried and overdone. If they hadn't been overdone they would have been great - the mojo (i think it was a mojo that came with them) was pretty good.  We also each tried a little glass of sherry - the manzanilla on the menu - I've never had sherry before and can't really make an educated comment about it because I have no reference for what sherry is supposed to taste like - it reminded me a little bit of Sake - but I can be way off. It was interesting.   For food one of us had the Pollo Cubano which was ok and the other had the catch of the day - I was a little disappointed in the catch of the day as I thought the focus of the dish would be the fresh fish but it ended up tasting more like the batter smothered with the creamy cheesy sauce.   I might go back to try some other items on the menu.Nothing to complain about as far as the service- in fact our waiter was great.  We would have tried the dessert if we weren't so full.  The live music was a great touch. Overall we enjoyed the ambiance but were disappointed in the food., 0
This building sighs with tired malaise.   I walked around for at least 20 minutes trying to follow the signs for the "Bodies" exhibition. Was offered "free tickets" in exchange for some awful timeshare presentation. Got lost. Gagged at the site of all the ugly decor around me. Left., 0

I have been going to Pho Kim Long for many years now. It is a long drive but my family and I made it a point to visit every few months and ONLY for the food. It must be because we are not Vietnamese or maybe we constantly get the most rude waiters working there... But I have never had good service there.  We had chosen to ignore that aspect and recommended the curry chicken and chicken wings to anyone looking for differentiation in their diets. After going today, 0

The bartender saved this place from a 0 or 1 start review.  I took my foodie son for happy hour on a Saturday while we were up north because he has rally wanted to check it out. There were NO other customers when we arrived so I would expect decent quality- even if we ordered from the happy hour menu. How hard is it to get french fries and a burger right?  French Fries: absurdly oversalted. The aiolis and truffle ketchup were tasty and, 0
The worst Best Buy I've ever been to as far as service goes. No one greeted me when I walked in and no one helped me while I was browsing on the sales floor. The cashier was so slow at ringing up the customers in front of me that I would have walked out had I not been holding what I was looking for in my hands. I wish there were a closer electronics store to me., 0

So nothing gets me more mad then a struggle to get to the business itself. I can easily get over it once i am there and the service and food are worth it. This place is on a normal day and night is one of those places that is worth going the extra mile to eat there. Luckly for this night i was across the street at a phoenix suns preseason game. Since the game was a blow out and it was only a preseason game i decide to leave early to go across the street and enjoy some delicious pizza. It was a Tuesday night and i looked up what time this location closes. The website said 9 on this particular night. I decided to leave the game at 835 since it should only take ten minutes to walk across the street. As i leave the game early with a friend who i am telling it will be worth his time the pizza is amazing and we cross the street we finally make it. As i approach the location i look at my phone to make sure we made it in time its 850. Right before we walk in my friend says "it looks closed." We walk in and the doors are still open as they should be there is still ten minutes in there business day.  As i approach the counter the girl says oh we are closed. I asked her why if the business hours are till nine. She told me because the business was dead and nobody was coming in. She said sorry and proceeded to clean behind the register. As me and my friend leave and walk back to are car we are so mad. I vow never to return to this location if u don't understand common business and how to serve the public professionally. I will also never recommend this location as u never know what you are going to get. Don't have business hours if you are not going to go by them., 0
I want to give them ZERO stars.  I called to change my appointment and they charged me for the original appointment that I changed.  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT???!!! I called and clearly said, 0
It was the first time that I dined at a Cheesecake Factory and it will likely be my last.  The wait time wasn't bad at all even though it appeared very busy.  The waitress was pleasant but seemed rushed.  She filled our drink orders promptly which is a big plus.  It was very noisy but aesthetically pleasing.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was adequate.  We ordered the ribeye steak medium rare for our main course. It came out well done.  They offered to cook another one for us but we didn't think they the next steak would be prepared any better so we just ordered some pasta.  The waitress never apologized for this inconvenience. The pasta was pretty bland but edible.  Overall it was not worth the time or money that we spent there.  If your going to go to a chain restaurant stick to Outback, 0

I came in yesterday for an eyebrow wax and gel pedicure. Never again. The older lady working burned my eyelids with the wax and then I sat soaking in water for an hour before someone was able to get to me. Overall it should have taken an hour for both services and I didn't leave until 2 hours later. Very disappointed with the customer service. The manager knew I waited a long time and did nothing about it. Should have offered something to compensate me for wasted time and a bad experience., 0

I take ODS shuttles to the airport almost monthly from the Venetian.  Usually there are no issues.  Today we seem to have either a dispatching issue or just confusion.  I showed up 15 minutes early as your supposed to and the driver showed up at roughly 10 til 3.  The driver was polite and greeted us and loaded our bags as usual.  We boarded and began to wait.  It was ten minutes after 3 when I got off and ask the driver when we would be departing.  He said I don't leave until 330.  The issue was we were supposed to depart at 3.  When I ask if we could depart early because the 3pm shuttle did not show up he said no.  While I understand that there could have been a delay elsewhere to prevent the 3 o'clock shuttle from getting there ODS or the driver should have made accommodations to transport the 6 guests to the airport at 3 if the other driver was delayed.  I know there are issues when it comes to transportation but it was the fact of how the driver handled it!  I ask the driver Geb, 0

I finally made it in this place. It was filthy but I was expecting that.   The place was packed because it was .49 cents a pound day. I was a little overwhelmed but I think anyone would be.   They have tons of garbage. Tons. when they wheel out new bins people go crazy. The employees literally scream at customers to not touch until they say go.   I actually purchased 20 pounds of stuff. I found some kids clothes and things for diy one thing I found was this sea shell chandelier thing that's going to be amazing with some spray paint.  I can't really say if I will or won't come back., 0

I went to their satellite location at 2020 Ardmore Blvd. in Forest Hills.  I took in 4 dress shirts to be pressed only.  I'm not happy.  The shirts barely look pressed.  The collars are absolutely smashed with no noticeable starch which I requested.  Smashed as if they sat a large hot brick on them and not an iron.  NO creases in the arms?  Very disappointed.  It was under $8 for the 4 shirts but what's the difference with doing such a poor job.  Take your dry cleaning elsewhere., 0

Went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% "service" fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  First I asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  Had NO clue what I was talking about.  Finally gave up and got a Coors Lite.  Food was overpriced and less than average.  I had the Baked Scrod.  Exact same dish at Eat N Park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  I would stay clear of this at all costs.  If you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at Sonoma Grill down the street.  I'm shocked this place is still in business., 0
No more shopping at Best Buy for us! After the first incident a few weeks prior to this incident where Best Buy pulled a bait and switch with a promotion (buy an iPad and get a free iPhone). --They were out of the 16 gb iPhone for the promotion, 0

I went into SuperPawn this morning hoping to get a small loan and there was a woman behind the counter helping another patron. I must've been a ghost because I wasn't even acknowledged.  A simple good morning ma'am I will be right with you would've been just fine. So I waited for about 5 to 7 minutes until she finished with the customer. Another woman comes from the storage area and doesn't speak to me either but it appeared that she may have smiled, 0
No longer my favorite Starbucks. Horrible customer service. Received bad service twice in 4 days. Apparently it is so hard to smile. Girl at the drive through really did not seem to care. Decided to go inside for once and they forgot my drink. The girl did not write it down, 0
I don't know why i have been here more than once, 0
My husband and I travelled from York, 0
We stayed in a "remodeled" room which apparently means some new paint/wallpaper and linoleum flooring.  It was probably a good thing the floor was linoleum we decided after seeing the disgusting carpets in the hall ways.  The carpets were so old and worn out that they were all wrinkled and buckling.  They were horribly stained and probably hadn't been vacuumed in years.  We had a "non-smoking" room that reeked of cigarettes in the bathroom.  We could hear everything said in the neighboring rooms (and they weren't being unusually loud).  The second night we needed to move to another room due to a leak in the bathroom coming from above.  I had to go to the front desk to get someone to do something after being on hold for 20 minutes.  The new room had a sink that didn't drain.  They offered no compensation for the hassle of needing to move at 1:30 in the morning.  The beds were very hard and the linens pretty poor quality.  We checked with other guests who experienced similar.    Over all the worst hotel stay we have ever had., 0
The location is upstairs in a tired looking food court. I eat Panda occasionally but not here! This is my second  time at this location and once again I chose a salad from Wendy's because the food here looks like it's been sitting out overnight, 0
they mess up every time i go unless my order is under 3 bucks, 0
This was our 2nd time at Oscars.  Our first experience was an "Oh Wow!".  Our 2nd time there was a bit of a disappointment.  To start things off, 0
Ate here yesterday. Didn't enjoy much about the dinner except that the chicken in the chicken and waffles was well cooked. Avoid this one., 0
Used to be our favorite family restaurant. Haven't been for a while. The service has gone downhill. Food is still delicious. Had to get our own small plates and refills took a while. Hoping they were just short staffed today., 0
Expected a much larger selection of draft beer! Also disappointed that the Mac and Cheese had a spicy nacho cheese taste when the menu said nothing to indicate that flavor. When I asked the waitress about it she said other tables mentioned to get it without the 'beer queso' .. which nobody would know about since it's not mentioned on the menu! Not enough meat on the steak sandwich and no feasible gluten-free options. It was a very clean restaurant - and was overall ok - but we won't be back., 0
Beers seemed to be a little higher priced than this lizard is used too. They do a have a pretty good tap. Lots of craft beers. Bit of a rocker bar. They we're blasting foo fighters. Nothing against foo and those that fight it but this is a bit of a sign. Also got the stare down from the regulars when I walked in. It's like they've never seen a 50 million year old lizard of death before., 0

Definitely an inconvenience and bunch of liars. They say that there's a reason for the tow and that there's a note. Bullsh*t. Twice in less than 3 months I'm dealing with this.... I'm over it. I can't deal with petty people and this company is exactly that. Terrible., 0
2.5 stars.  I stopped in here on a whim during my walk home last night, 0
Nothing makes me happier than getting a mani/pedi. Unfortunately, 0
I was so excited to try this place but i could not be more dissapointed. Carpaccio was a joke. Worst i have ever had. Stuck to the plate and it was paper thin.  So thin that you could barely taste it. No seasoning on my steak. Poorest prepared filet i have ever had. Good drinks but food was terrible. Will never go back. Bad service also.  No one asked me the entire night how the food was.  i had to ask the waiter 3-4 times for my drinks because he kept forgetting. Probably the lowest quality fine dining restaurant I have ever been to., 0

Went through the drive through today for two custard cones about 1:30pm. The gal taking orders at the drive through and taking payment was wearing rubber gloves. I questioned why she would be handling money with gloves as normally they wear gloves when they handle the food. When I paid she took my money and gave me change while wearing the rubber gloves. She handed me a stack of napkins and my receipt and said my cones would be there in a second. She then went over and scooped my two ice cream cones wearing the same gloves she was wearing to work the register. Normally employees will wrap a napkin around the cone but not her, 0
I would start by giving the nurses here 5 stars. I had two out patient surgeries and both times I had fantastic nursing care.  Now the bad-  Pre Op- I was given a packet and told to go from department to department getting my pre op stuff done. I went to cardiology for an EKG and sat for two hours. They have one machine for the hospital, 0
I've been slow on the reviews lately - blame it on the cold AZ winters (i.e., 0
This place almost sucks. I have never been impressed with the food. It gets really  crowded during happy hour due to food and drink specials. If not for the happy hour, 0
Horrible. Some friends of mine and I were here one night before going to Marquee and hit this place up. The sushi place was too busy so this looked like the next best thing. We started with 3 appetizers- the potato wrapped chorizo, 0
The front office and billing is terrible.  We were a new patient and a cash pay and told to pay the bill in total at visit.  We did pay and their office took the money and charged us on our card.  Then they billed us at home after the fact because they made a $4 error when we paid in person.  They insisted that we cover their error.  When we stated it was paid at the time and it was an error on their office, 0
With a name like Sexxpresso I was expecting the Hooter's version of coffee.  I got the Hooter's part but the coffee was horrible.  Espresso was somewhere between burnt and rancid.  Blech.  It'll take more than Hooter's to get me back.  I don't care what the schtick is, 0
Lunch here yesterday. Service was terrible and my friend was served her lunch without utensils. She asked for utensils and the waitress left and did not return. I got up and asked the hostess and she gave me attitude. I didn't get what I ordered but ate it anyway. The food was good. The fly buzzing our table was not. I'll never go here again. Bad service., 0
It's a buffet not a 5 star steakhouse but even taken with a grain of salt this buffet is way below par. A buffet usually gives a fairly ok roast but not here. Two slices from two separate roasts and I could literally not cut them. The crab legs look and taste gross and the eggs taste more like powdered egg product than egg. Tried the stir fry and it had no flavor. Why anyone has waitresses at a buffet I don't know but these ones are inattentive and gross. The orange pork was good as were the breadsticks, 0

The food and wine were good. The service was horrible.  Our reservation was for 8:30 p.m. and we did not get seated until almost 9:00 p.m.  Took another half hour to receive appetizer whereby we complained to manager.  After that our service improved., 0

I am actually rating the pet grooming a 1 star. I needed to find a place quickly for my dogs to be groomed because the paw Spa where I usually take my dogs to were fully booked for 2 weeks. I figured I would try "At Your Service grooming" since I always buy dog food from there. I made an appointment and they told me I could come right away. When I got there the room smelled so nasty and dirty like wet dog. It was extremely humid and as soon as we got there, 0
Large selection, 0
This is by far the worst fast food restaurant in town. Don't get me wrong. The food is decent. But the establishment is ridiculous! The drive thru lines are outrageously slow & long. The people at the window are RUDE and not helpful at all. And God forbid you need a condiment with your meal. They won't ask you if you want one and get irritated when you do ask. It's just as bad on the inside. Slow lines. I purposely won't come here just because of their terrible service and EXPENSIVE prices!!!, 0

I have given this place multiple chances but they've let my wife and I down for the last time.  Both my wife and I have had issues with employees being rude and not completing what we had paid for.  My latest experience was by far the worst.  When I arrived I was greeted and the employee tried to up sell me.  I said no it's a brand new vehicle i do not need those items.  He told me and I quote "not to spit that sh!t here".   I laughed it off as immaturity and moved on.  Upon completion I noticed that the items I paid for were not completed and what was done was half way completed.  Then to top it off we got home only to find multiple scratches across the top and sides of my roof.  This vehicle had 3000 miles and was not scratched.  I will never return to this place.  I'll just do it myself for now on., 0
We discovered after returning home that we left an item in the room. WE know exactly where it was when we left. After three phone calls to the hotel to see if it was turned in, 0
After reading about this fun new tapas place I convinced my finicky French fianc\u00e9 to try it out, 0
Last night was the first time I ever had food from park on Fremont. I thought it was awesome that they delivered downtown especially since the reviews were great. I ordered the San Diego burger and my wife had the steak salad. We also ordered a side of the fried pickles. I have to admit that I was not impressed. The meat on the burger was way too much and you couldn't really taste anything else. The steak salad was ok but definitely nothing to rave about. The fried pickles were ok but they were soggy and cold by the time we got them. Now I understand that having good delivered can and will affect the food quality but even having said that I don't know if I would ever actually eat there again because it was just mediocre and they don't have a lot of options on the menu., 0
Shit hole of a place to live, 0
Went here the other night with some girl friends after having some dranks. The fry bread was so salty. Both the sweet and savory. I thought I was getting a "Navajo taco" with green chilis and what I got was a gross burger patty with fry bread as a bun. When I've gone to kayenta, 0
I really hate giving bad reviews, 0

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating but the food was just okay. I'm a big fan of Ethiopian food and I've definitely eaten some REALLY good stuff in my day. I really wanted to like it here since they were so nice but the injera was cold and the food lacked flavor. It was also pretty overpriced for what you get. Super disappointing since it was the first time I introduced my dad to Ethiopian food and I had hyped up how good it was going to be. I left feeling bad for taking him there., 0
Read Tempe R's review. I felt I created an alter ego like Roger the Alien from Ameican Dad because he literally had the exact same experience as I did. Plus he said he's gone there twice without explanation so maybe we are in fact the same person that keeps changing personas.   Today it was 109 degrees and while I was waiting for my food...I did so outside because it was actually cooler than this muggy mess. How in the hell can they not have air conditioning...in Phoenix, 0
I think I must have gone on an off night. The food was not good. The chicken was very very dry and slightly difficult to eat. It was fast and easy which was what we were looking for at the time but the food was unappetizing. The service was great and friendly., 0
THis place has really lost so much fuel for me. I used to pump it up to those I knew who put it down. not anymore. If you cant beat them join them. j/k.  Seriously the last time I came in here I met up with my bf who went right after work. I was ignored ... not for 10, 0

Only reason I visited this place was because limited options for pizza in my area during late night. Next time I'll just opt for a frozen pizza in the oven.   Wings were terrible. Ranch is pre-packaged nasty stuff.   Never again!, 0

Stay away is all I can say.  So bad in every aspect.   Dillon's is the only place to go on the lake.  Do not waste your time or money.   Got sick from their horrific so called "breakfast buffet".  Nothing but a joke.  Absolute filth and neglect.  Just stay away., 0

We had a true EMERGENCY tonight and the woman who answered the phone not only seemed disinterested but she was annoyed. She first quoted me $150 an hour (which I wrote down amongst all of my notes from trying to reach a reputable plumber) but then as I was trying to see if she was going to get someone here faster than another company who gave me a 3 hour window, 0

Wow.  I don't think I've ever given a 1 before.  But this place deserves it.  Super Bowl Sunday.  We arrive and the place is probably 25-33% empty.  We are then informed that everything is by invitation.  Wouldn't have a problem with that, 0
I was very disappointed. I found this establishment on yelp as I needed a good halfway point between Tucson and Phoenix for a date. I thought a winery would be an excellent choice and made plans to go there. I called ahead of time to ensure they were open and I got a recording that stated they were open Saturday 11-4. I left a message just to be sure and asked them to call back as I was driving a considerable distance to meet there. I did not receive a call back but after checking the website and calling again the day of everything said they'd be open so I went down from Phoenix. I arrived to find the gates closed and chained but there were people walking around so I parked and tried calling again but there was no answer. I found an opening in the fence and went in to inquire if they hadn't unlocked yet. I was told they were closed for the summer and they don't know why I hadn't gotten a call back. They suggested that we could come back Sunday as they had a wedding scheduled. I don't know if that meant they wanted us to crash the wedding or if they were opening for that day because they would already be there., 0
It's in a pretty good location in DT Scottsdale, 0
I'm not quite sure how this restaurant rated as high as it does.  The rolls were bland and the AYCE deal was "meh".   The staff did what they could to make it a good experience making it the only reason I didnt give this place a 1.  This said please understand the AYCE covers only the sushi, 0

Got delivery from here a couple weeks ago. My brother-in-law wanted Chicago style deep dish pizza and so I yelped it and picked this place since they had good reviews and offered delivery in our area. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. First of all they took an hour and 40 minutes to deliver... I was warned on the phone that deep dish pizzas take longer to cook and so it could be up to an hour. But I really did not expect it to take that long (the place is only about a 5 min drive from my house).   First of all, 0
oohh i really wish they hadnt adopted our citie's shorthand for their lame club's name i actually waited in line w/ my brother to get inside this dump ughh it was...well...surreal? seemed like a bad dream hopefully that bad dream will never repeat itself, 0
Been to a lot of nail spas. I would say this one is one of the worst. To start they do not use plastic liners on their soaking tubs. Second although they do a decent job on your standard pedi. Im just not too impressed. They lacked the quality work of an experienced manicurist. We like getting our ingrowns removed and if your not skillful you can be in a world of hurt. The chairs are dated and I dont understand why the nice 42" flat panel tv is on the back of the customers. They have a nice 12" tube tv for the customers. But my advice if you like quality work this may not be the place for you. If you like cheap you get what you pay for. I wont even bother coming back., 0
They need more workers poor service had too wait on ordering and then had to wait on food way to long, 0

ive been here a total of 3x.  1st visit: AOK. Would have given 3 stars but they were sold out of the Saturday special which was $3 tanks.  2nd visit: NFL team shirts. Sold out.

Should change the name to Lobster Mehhh. I felt like I was at the food court in the mall when i saw how this place was set up. It would have been better if it were since the mall has more seating. Had the lobster roll combo that came with fries and a drink. The Lobster roll was not a traditional one in my eyes. It was filled with plenty of lobster but was not tossed in the mayo/scallion mix a Maine lobster roll would have. It seemed to have a vinegar based medley that overwhelmed any on the natural flavors. The item that was the best was the fries, 0

I have just moved to Arizona from California and I am looking to replace the Country bar I went to in California. This was my first country bar I had been too and driving up the fact that it was in a strip mall I honestly did not know how it was going to turn out. It was a Saturday and for the time that I was there I did not have to pay to get in which I liked of course. And you can't beat the 50 cent long necks or wells. However I wanted a jack n coke and found out that was $5.00. I then asked for the well and got two different drinks when I went back for a 2nd... So that threw me off. It has a good size dance floor but for me I think there is far to much two step compared to line dancing. They did play the dances I knew so I was able to experience it which was great. But really that's the biggest complaint for me is they need to make it even between dances. They also started playing hip -hop rap fairly early in he night I don't know if that's normal for the time frame but for me if I go to a country bar I want to listen and dance to country. Leave the hip hop for late in the night., 0
My boyfriend and I wanted a drink and some sushi and decided to check out Pallets because it's very close to our home. Being on Roosevelt Row we had high expectations for this restaurant but those hopes were dashed. Right away we were quite unimpressed with their paper menus that were stained presumably with food and drinks. At the time we went it was happy hour and the happy hour menu was nothing special, 0
For years I took my children to Dr. Sina. I did this despite Dr. Sina. I always loved her staff and at one point Dr. Cat who is no longer there.  Dr. Sina has a horrible bed side manner and at times is down right rude.  The final straw was when she said my child needed a baby root canal and crown.  We went to a new dentist fire a second opinion and all that was needed was a large filling. Also, 0

We had the sushi in the food court and it was inedible. The tuna smelled like they got it from a can and the rice the most disgusting rice I've ever eaten. My wife got the noodle soup and it was better but not exactly good. I should have demanded my money back but I didn't want to wait in line to do so. If the sushi was any indication of the rest of the food here, 0
I wasn't to keen on this place as soon as we pulled up.  There was construction in the main court yard.  There was a smell of pesticide in the air, 0
Wife brought home a half dozen vanilla cream donuts with ALMOST ZERO cream from this location.

I'm not really sure about my experience here. It has been a long time since I have been to a dermatologist. I was in and out so fast that I'm not sure if it was a good thing or what the heck just happened??!!  lol...  The receptionist (I think her name was Kate...maybe not) was efficient, 0

The NYNY is a very nice hotel conveniently situated on the four corners of the south end of the strip.  Easy access to MGM and Excalibur.  The rooms were clean and tastefully decorated.  With that being said, 0
This place it just O.K.  There was a wait to get in and when we got seated we got the high bar stool chairs and after an hour my feet fell asleep.    The service was TERRIBLE.  The waitress was difficult to find.  My boyfriend never had his drink refilled.  The food was below average but the prices were NOT.  I had a super huge Margarita that was great though and that was the only redeeming thing about the place.  Still it has a good location on the strip...but if you are looking for quality food...keep walking., 0

I have always liked Moes but the pricing is ridiculous.  They charge extra for everything.  I ordered a side of queso and it was the smallest container I have ever seen.  Shouting "Welcome to Moes" seems like a routine job to the employees as something they have to do- not genuine at all.  One lady that assembles the food always looks miserable and acts as if you are bothering her when picking your toppings.  Manager always has a smile and is quite nice but staff. portions and pricing will reconsider another visit for me., 0
Service slow. Food was partly cold and they didn't have the specials like the one my husband and I go to in Escondido, 0
I've honestly never had a good experience here. The waiters always seem to hate their jobs and the hostesses just stand there and watch TV. I just left there and got the unlimited soup and salad and our waitress only checked on us once after the food came out. We had to ask the hostess to go find her when we wanted a refills. She passed us multiple times without even looking at us and then we had to wait for her to remember about us for us to get the check. I wanted desert but I wasn't willing to wait more for it. Third bad experience. Won't give them another chance., 0

Ok let me start this review by saying I used to go to Misty's back in the day. I am happily married now and me and the wife just don't do the bars anymore. BUT on this rare occasion I decided to get a few friends together and go party at Z Girls club. We went a lil early to catch the "Burlesque" show. We had been there for about an hour and been drinking BUT because the show was about to start they came around and wanted the $5 dollar cover charge for the show. I was flabbergasted. How tacky is that....I can see charging people just coming in but you went around the whole fucking room to collect money from people that were already there WTF - business must be bad! So we paid because we didn't feel like leaving. Lets just say the show was crappy.....not what I expected and the girls were fat. We half assed watched the show and continued to drink. Music was ok but requests never seemed to get played??? We did drink a lil bit and one of my friends was a bit tipsy OK its a bar people!!! She took her shoes off while we were standing at the table and this bouncer/security geek told her to put her shoes back on. OK they were 5 inch stilettos and when she was shoving her foot in she kinda fell over a lil SO this ass decides to kick her out. OMG are you serious. She already stopped drinking and had a bottle of water in her hand. I had already closed my tab out and we were going to be leaving soon anyway but I couldn't believe he wanted us to go. I dropped way too much money in there for them to give us the boot for something like that. We weren't bothering anybody. I have a feeling they treated us like shit because we don't go there often. You could tell they treated the regulars better than the new faces. I don't know it was just a disappointing night. I have read all the other reviews and I agree with most of them. I know several people wont step foot in there because of the owner. I wish Phoenix would get a decent "girl" bar. OH BTW the really pretty bartender quit and the ones left are really old or really fat. I couldn't believe the bartender had this shirt on with her big belly hanging out!!!! LOL what a sight  Do yourself a favor - get your favorite alcoholic beverage and turn your radio up real loud and dance around your living room - you will have more fun :), 0
My friend and I were looking forward to having lunch here on our lunch break last Friday. I drove by the new restaurant and thought it was a good idea to try it out, 0

So far they're only succeding in pissing me off.  I'm trying to plan a large event here and have been emailing and calling for two weeks with very little response.   If you don't want my business, 0
Party of 10.. we got seated right away after a great time at Moon.  Decent american food. We ordered a bacon cheeseburger and clam chowder soup. Burger was kinda dry. Needed a lot of condiments. Clam chowder was average. It wasn't thick and flavorful as I would have liked it to be. Had a lot of potatoes. Should have called it potato soup. Other than american they have chinese food! Chinese as a late night snack AWESOME! My cousin order fried rice, 0
This place is very close to my work, 0
Not my favorite place. I went here with my sis and we split the veggie roll and another shrimp tempura roll and edamame beans. We didnt like any of it. The service was pretty good but other than all of the waters and bartenders being drop dead gorgeous i would not go back for food.., 0
I'm not sure why I've heard so many good things about this place as I was disappointed over all. For one, 0

Tried to stop in for lunch on Thursday and they were closed. It looks like the restaurant has been abandoned.  So sad! We will miss them and those tasty firecracker eggrolls!, 0
Overpriced.   Got lasanga and it was very small portioned.    Friend got the pizza and that was large.   Waiter was dull bland and boring. Gumdrop margarita didnt even have a gumdrop in it.  Not very tasty drinks. Lasagna was tasty even tho it was tiny.   Cool view of shark tank.    Waiter was a buzzkill, 0
Don't go. Friend and I went in for late night eats and a drink. No crowd at all. We took a seat and waited patiently. No service. 10 minutes later as Jeremiah and another employee talked and drank we were still waiting. Finally we just left. There was no reason we were not waited on. Guess we were not that important. Won't try it again., 0
I really wanted to love this korean restaurant because of the proximity to my house but I had better.  I ordered the kimchi fried rice and i was hoping it was just as delicious as Hodoris but it isn't.  I had four spoonfuls and pushed it off to the side.  I then tried the yuk gae jang which was decent but again not as good as Hodoris or Chodang. My husband ordered Kalbi which he only ate 1/2 of it since it was extremely fatty, 0
The waitress MARIA ROSANNA was horrible come on now? She act like she don't care about her job and I don't recommend her to anybody. MARIA ROSANNA find a different job because you SUCK, 0

Just came back from this Urgent care and it will be my last ...and entire life of doctors visit this doctor Valerie Jaskowski was by far the rudest ubnoxious doctor ever ..I dont know how this women became a care person because she is certainly NOT ! I took my daughter for care there ...when my daughter came out she said she was not sure why she got antibiotics she didn't get a urinary test to see whats going on and first thing she open the door to the room she loudly asked in front of the staff if she has a VG problem and continue talking ...when my kid came out she was mad and she said this women is rear unprofessional ...as the dr walked out I confronted her ...after confirming what she said to my child she start yelling at her that she is the expert over so many years and she know better your not a doctor she keeps yelling at my kid my kid asked her so why did I pay 95$ for if I dont get checked and the dr replied to her very food ...because I charge what ever I want this is my fee for my services ...I looked at her and told to stop yelling and she needs to control herself ..your not very professional and this not how you talk to a patient dont care how old she is u need to inform her and have a better tone ......horrible ...some people should not be doctors !, 0

GREAT FOOD but be sure to check your bill! I celebrated my bday there and was a disaster. NONE of the 15 people I was with would ever go back there. The waiter was so rude and slow; we had to get the bottles of wine and serve them ourselves. When my friend's bill came he charged extra bottles and had to change it 3 times (and he got upset on top). The day after I realized I ended up paying for 2 extra bottles. I went to see the owner Imad. He was rude and denied it; he let me go with a silly gift certificate. I spoke to other people about it and heard that's what they do! they rip you off (cause most people don't complain). So they rather make money and loose clients. Shame on them. DON'T GO THERE!, 0
Menu says Crap Puffs...that should have been my first clue.  Egg flour soup looked like snot.  Lemon chkn = grilled chkn pieces with goo!  There were three of us and two of us were served together.  When we finally decided that they had completely forgotten one meal and got up to leave (as we all shared the two meals and were finished eating) they brought the third meal!, 0
I came here a few months back and the food was really good. I came again today and that was not the case. The food was oily and the service sucked. Our waitress barely even spoke to us and it took her 20min to bring us out check after she glanced at us when we were done. She seemed super unenthusiastic to be at her job and definitely took it out on us. I don't think ill be back., 0
I only come because I'm new to Las Vegas and am scared to go elsewhere. My personal experience has been...eh. They're not that friendly, 0
My first experience in this restaurant was HORRIBLE. It was my classmate's 21 birthday and she wanted to have dinner at this restaurant because it was close to club marquee and we love sushi. This place was SH*T. The prices were too EXTREME for the small baby portions. I ate at so many sushi restaurants, 0
Friendly service. Got the fajitas. They were pretty bland. We got the fried ice cream for desert. It was either not fried or not fried this century. It was rock solid and was almost impossible to eat. All in all I would not return here., 0
I'm not happy with this location. They need to have store meetings just so that everyone is on the same page. I was looking for an item and two store associates helped me get it. When I go to check out, 0
On our second time eating at Tom Yum we had a very disappointing experience.  It was about 5:45 and the restaurant was not busy.  There were 3 of us ordering.  My husband got has meal first.  After a long wait my mother got her food.  My husband was over half way done with his meal before my meal was brought to the table.  When I looked at it I thought it did not seem to be what I ordered.  It was loaded with bean sprouts and my meal was supposed to have broccoli and no bean sprouts..  I looked at the menu and was sure it was wrong.  When we told the waitress she said they must have mixed up the order and would cook the right dish. So I sat and waited again. We were charged for my meal even though the other 2 diners at my table were finished before my food ever came.   I noticed at other tables people received their meals at different times too.. The whole experience was very poorly handled by the kitchen and servers., 0

We visited Mandalay Bay on our honeymoon.  My husband wanted to go to this attraction.  I was reluctant because I am against exhibits with animals kept in tiny unnatural spaces.  I agreed to go because he was doing stuff I was interested in as well.  Admission was about $18 a person.  The whole thing is a walk through that takes no time to complete.  I really did not think it was worth the money at all.  He did take some pictures but I think there are better hotel attractions to spend money on., 0
Went here with some friends after a lovely Sunday afternoon of giving my credit cards a work out at the mall. I was teased by fresh hot tea and some lovely steamed dumplings as starters. We ordered the shredded beef, 0

I live nearby and the 2 star rating is based on 10+ visits. Most unfavorable experience is with their waiters. I tip them regular base 15% and I expect much better service. I won't be their place anymore.   Things I have experienced with this place:  1) Go there lunch time around 1:30 PM for three times on week days, 0
Typical Vegas nightclub. Nothing to write home about. Samantha Ronson was spinning and thats the only reason this place gets a 2 and not a 1.  The 2 is because I was 86'd for being drunk.. I know its a "policy" and liability and that Vegas cracks down on kicking people out who have done nothing wrong but are just intoxicated. Seriously though, 0

My bro told me about this place to get me to start vaping and quit smoking. This place is near my part of town so I drove down there on 05/10/2013 to get me started on vaping. When I walked in I was greeted then a girl went to help me. I told her that I smoke and wanted to start vaping. She showed me the most expensive kit and I told her I was on a budget and when I have enough money I'll eventually upgrade. She acted like "come on buy the thing and go" type of look. As any first vapor would get I got the PSV 510 e-cig which looks like a cig. So she showed me how to fill it and the one I tried was working but she didn't check to see if everything works. I got home and tried charging my other battery so it will be set for when the one I'm vaping dies. The battery would not charge so the next week when I have money I go back down and tell them the battery was DOA and they acted like the lady who sold it would be talked to. Didn't happen anyway they replaced my battery and I bought a few more juices. A week later my battery won't work so I go back in with my receipt and the first thing out of the guys mouth is "you can't keep bringing back batteries expecting to get a new one for free" at this point I felt like there was no respect or customer service. Even though I was dissapointed I bought their ego kit which was $70 I did get a free 6ml bottle of e-liquid. At this point I think I gave up going there to buy e-juice and other stuff. I did some research and I now been buying stuff online from other vendors. Now as far as juices it seems like pink spot don't have great tasting juices at all since I went to a different vendor. Pink spot juice is not that flavorful and their flavors fade. I'm just going to say this pink spot has a nice shop but as far as customer service it sux and is a poor attitude. There is only 1 person I would actually talk to and he takes his time and helps explain stuff. So would I recommend this place to newbies no maybe veterans if they want to try new e-juice but that is about it., 0
I rarely give 2 stars for a restaurant but something needs to be brought up for attention. First I waited for half an hour to be seated because there is no one at the front desk. I had to go look to their kitchen and found waitress there and ask to be seated. Second, 0
Over priced. The only cool part was the location of the restaurant. If the Olive Garden is the best Italian restaurant in your home town, 0

Free with validation! This used to be my starting point for my downtown shenanigans. No more. Brought family here from out of town to do some gambling. Played the slots but lady luck wasn't on our side. We cashed out our vouchers at the cashier cage and gave my ticket for validation. He hands it back and says he can't do it. So per his instructions we go look for a slot attendant and there's no one in sight so I ask a pit boss. All we got were rude "I can't do it" attitudes. In a town so reliant on customer service Binion's needs to change they're attitudes because nothing else is drawing people back to this outdated casino., 0

We went there 9 years ago and were deferred because we had just moved to the Valley and were living in a studio. They stated that we didn't have a 'real' address (?) We were renting a studio down the street and wanted to take our time to get to know the area. We bought a house a few months later. Fast forward NINE YEARS LATER. We try to donate again and are deferred AGAIN because of the past issue. Even though we have our home address on our AZ driver's license, 0
We came here on a Friday night. My husband ordered a dirty martini and it was so dirty, 0
Medicore food at best. I had the Kobe Beef sliders and my hubby had the hawaiian pizza. My sliders tasted lke cheap cafeteria meat but the fries were good. Hubby said he had better pizza at pizza hut. The service was ok. Our waitress was a bit flirty for my taste and the manager who was cleaning tables kep staring at us like we stole something. Not impressed! This military family "Will not return"...!!!, 0

VERY ANTI LAW ENFORCEMENT!!!!! THEY HATE THE POLICE  Witnessed them actively disrespect local Phoenix Police Officers while they were investigating something. Any business that does that to their police officers will not get my business Anywhere in this country!!

I genuinely feel bad writing a negative review about this restaurant because I totally get it... being a server in a badly run, 0
The only way I will be back in here again is if I am being dragged in here with some friends. I would rather not visit again.   I think a "regular sized" forever 21 is too much for my ADD-like mind to handle. This was overwhelming. How in the hell can you find anything in here in less than an hour?? Not only did I visit the same section more than 3 times thinking I was in a different part of the store, 0
Came here on a weekday to find this place absolutely packed. I had heard good things and was excited to try the food. It took them about 20 minutes to come around and take our order in the first place and the food took another 30 minutes. We opted for the lunch special where I got the chicken pad thai. It was pretty spicy even though I'd asked for mild. The meat also didn't taste very fresh. Overall, 0
Food was good but the service was horrible especially the lady with short hair. ( oldest one )She was asking me how many I said 3 but 1 more is coming then she just walk away without saying anything and go put reserved sign on the table then she just disappeared I thought she would comeback and sit me down but she was doing something in the kitchen and I've been waiting for 20 mins until I can't wait anymore I walked to her and asked can I sit down she said we have a reservation wtf????!!!??u should have told me something ??? And I saw her shake her head ?? What did I do wrong?? She was so rude and unprofessional at all then I waited for another 5 mins she sat me down on the table that put reserved sign?!!?! Who the hell reserved so now I knew she fucking lie then after we ordered they brought out all the food I swear servers never came back and check if everything ok or do we want anything else..........never refill the drinks have to call and waive a hand to her which is I really don't wanna do but seriously damn my cup of water all empty!!!! No wonder why this's place mostly is slow.. Food is super awesome but service is horrible all the times!!!!! If I could find some place that have same quality meats I would never come back here again!!!!!!!!!!     0.5star for service not even 1  (to lady short hair)she could hv been better...:-(, 0

Been here twice. The first time the waitress spilled food on me and with no apology. I returned again another time just to appease my daughters. Again the waitress( a different one) was short with us and obviously in too much of a hurry to attend to our needs. But my real gripe was the glasses. They were filthy. All of them. I couldn't use them, 0

WORST. MEAL. EVER.   I wish I could give this place Zero stars.  My husband and I came into town for a business conference and the night of our arrival we went to the village to find something for dinner.   We glanced over the menu before taking a seat.  The dishes in print looked good...  We ordered a few dishes to share and each one was a half-step above inedible. The "vegetable" tempura was horrific.  Not the usual vegetables that you find in this dish -  Baby carrots, 0
Decided to get some pizza and garlic bites to go. I got the 12 pieces on the bites and wanted 2 sauces. The server assured me that there was 2 marinara sauces. There was only one. I asked if they had a garlic sauce and she said no, 0

Yes it's cheap but that's because it sucks.   I've only been to Vegas twice and one time I made the mistake of going cheap and staying here. From the outside the hotel looks like King Arthur and Andy Warhol had a baby and fed that baby Gerber shrooms. Its a super colorful and ugly castle. If you're five you might think it looks cool, 0
Worst mani  ever. She didn't sanitize the tools after she was done.  They all rinse them with water then put then into a box with a paper towel. I saw it and confronted her she lied and said she did sanitize. Someone come take their license away, 0

They are about to switch over to the new name of The D so I have no idea what to expect. That being said Fitzgerald's was never known as the Bellagio of Freemont Street. I do think that you should come to Las Vegas and if this is the only place available come anyway! Live it up, 0
It bothers me that I even have to give it one star. I don't know what happened over the last year. This used to be a great place with great food, 0

We got the Presidential Suite on the 51rst floor for a bachelor party.  The room was amazing. 3500+ square feet, 0
We went on a Saturday night. It was OK.  I hate giving bad reviews but this place was definitely not destination worthy.    My GF had the prime rib which was tender but bland.  I had the crab legs. They were pretty small. The "juice wasn't worth the squeeze" on a couple of the legs.  Both entrees came with a salad bar which had maybe 10 ingredients to choose from. Not impressive.  To top it off there was a fan running full blast right above our table. When we asked the waitress to turn it down she told us that the manager was the only person who knew how to turn it down and he was on vacation.  So our food got cold really quickly.   If you are in Cottage Grove and want a bar burger I'm sure this place will suffice but not much beyond that., 0

Horrible motel! I wish I would have read the reviews on here  The rooms are extremely filthy and unkept  The towels and bed sheets did not look clean at all even after I asked for replacements  I don't understand what type of establishment they are trying to run here!

My family and I had been seated and we waited for 15 minutes for someone to take our orders. No one even offered us a drink. My dad had called for someone to take our order but none of the servers gave us any recognition. We then walked out and no one even noticed. They obviously do not no how to serve their customers., 0

We had a terrible experience at this place tonight. We wanted to celebrate my mother-in-law's 89th birthday with a special night out. Had reservations for 7 people at 7:15pm.

Wow.... Really?!?  Expected so much more from this place just because it was in the Aria.  This is Vegas and there's tons of places to choose from so why not step your game up. Service was horrible from beginning to end. We were sat down promptly, 0
So maybe its because I live in Texas, 0
Atmosphere is run down. Booths with holes with a warehouse feel. Upon being seated recieved a crumpled paper menu (appeared to be a takeout menu) with writing all over it in pencil. Was told it was the previous restaurants owners disposable menu used to order from the sushi bar, 0
Our experience at notion with a lowercase 'n' began well.  I made reservations on their website, 0
Remind me to never come back here. The employees are crazy and the customers even crazier. Two stars cause I like the food.  Employee wanted to argue with me about cell phones. Customer wanted to argue with me about the health of beanie wells., 0
On rare occasions I eat at the cafe or coffee shops inside the Strip properties...this weekend I did it twice. The first time was at Planet Dailies. I was with some of my family members, 0
I really hope these aren't "Charlotte's best" wings. After all the positive reviews, 0
My husband visiited this place yesterday for lunch even though I told him of my poor experience.  He came back with an even worse story than mine! EEWWWW!  Lets just say that he'd be doing a service to the good people of Gilbert if he called the health inspector.  GORDON RAMSAY WHERE ARE YOU? I know lets send Man Vs. Food into this place, 0
I am from California and went there on Friday night and it only had DJ.  They charged me $25 for cover charge because I am not LV resident.  I paid and went in there and found no dance floor.  Everyone was dancing around their little tables.  I wouldn't call this is fun.  That's suck.   If you are out of State, 0

My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, 0
It looks like a lot of the higher reviews are for breakfast. So maybe I'm doing it wrong, 0
We drove 45 minutes to get to this haunted house.  Waited in line for an hour and 20 minutes.. All for it to be over in 15.  Do not waist your time.  Consists of a lot of rooms with people screaming in your ear or blowing on the back of your neck.  Not scary at all.  Pretty lame.  Even the "entertainment" while waiting in line was bad.  Should have known that's how the inside would be.  Save your money and go somewhere else!, 0
Worst place I have ever stayed by far! The customer service was absolutely terrible! First of all The room was a dump, 0
This is essentially a motel on a huge piece of property.  Carpet in the bathroom area, 0
Disappointed that they don't offer biodegradable cups, 0
Rocco's has some of the best buffalo wings I've ever eaten.  We love them at our house.  For some reason they don't offer celery or carrots and I wish that they did.  They wait staff is always attentive when I dine in.  They also have a great Greek salad.  I haven't been very impressed with their pizza or calzones.  The pizza is extremely greasy and a lot of the time the crust isn't cooked all the way through so it's nice and soggy.  I've ordered their calzones before and the insides are always cold and the marinara sauce they serve with it is a flavorless disappointment.  I will still continue to go there for wings and the Greek salad but as far as the pizza goes, 0
I regret not going back to Jean George's Prime restaurant.   I wouldn't  go back to Mastro's if you paid me. To be fair it wasn't because the service was bad because it was very good. Props to our waiter Troy.  If you're a steak-snob you're going to weep for the cow who gave his life to the second rate chef who doesn't know how to season a cut of meat. I ordered the 18oz bone-in filet which is a glorious piece of meat. It was the first time in my life I didn't finish a steak.  If you're like most people you'll have ONE, 0
Don't know what's going on here but the service and food used to be top notch - not so much anymore. Ordered two gluten free pizzas and a bucket of wings for pick up. I show up 15 minutes late and the pizzas aren't ready. So I wait 10 minutes and they go to box it up and one of the pizzas is MIA. I can see the staff looking for the second pizza and then I see one of the cooks pulling a GF pizza dough out to make the missing pie and I almost flip. You've got to be kidding, 0
Contacted Roberto 5 days ago and was given his cell phone number to send over photos and get a quote for a couch of mine that needed new cushions. Seemed very nice on the phone. Sent photos over right away with ideas on what I wanted done. Received no response so 2 days later I texted again asking if he had received the photos. He responded right away and asked what I would like done (even though I had already detailed that in first text) and that he had received the photos. Resent the details. Then again, 0
I must've ordered the wrong thing. Dangit. And I was so excited to try this place, 0
I've been to this location multiple times when visiting my folks in Henderson. Recently we made reservations for 8 at 7PM on a Saturday. The reason I'm just giving it a "Meh" is because of the wait time...although we had a reservation, 0
This is one of the most screwed up Wendys in Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, 0
Horrible all the way around. Pay the extra $10-$15 more per day and rent from the major guys., 0
Worst nail salon ever.   I made the mistake of buying a Groupon for a mani/pedi here without really doing any research. Not a smart move on my part. The place was totally dusty and there was no AC. Being that it was like 90 degrees that day, 0
Nice theater with spacious seating.  Our movie was for 7:10 but after almost 1/2 hour of previews we were wondering if our movie would ever start. One really BIG issue I had was how filthy the toilets were. There was poop stains on the seat, 0

Go on a relatively slow night on Mill Ave. Bouncer talks to girls for several minutes before letting you inside. No server or if there is one the wait is completely up in the air. Go to the bar to order a beer on draft, 0
Man is this place overrated (although apparently not on Yelp). My friends think the sandwiches are really great for some reason. They're not. They're perfectly average sandwiches you could make at home with a little effort. They're not bad any means, 0
This place is a low down dirty shame. It's a shame that service and ingredients were not just in short supply, 0
TERRIBLE. THIS WAS THE WORST SHIPPING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. i had an extremely important package & paid for it to be over nighted. They sent it to Glendale California INSTEAD of Glendale Arizona. Over nighted it from CA to AZ AGAIN - ON A SATURDAY @ MY WORK. WOULDNT CHANGE THE SHIPPING ADDRESS TO MY HOUSE FOR ME SO I WOULDNT HAVE TO SIT AT WORK ON A SATURDAY & THEY NEVER EVEN SHOWED UP! it's 5:56pm on saturday night & i just got off the phone with FedEx where I was finally informed I would rec'v this IMPORTANT package on MONDAY. Thanks FedEx. Will Definitely being using UPS for all our future daily business shipping needs., 0
I would consider any review above one star for Beckett's Table to be suspect.  We had reservations for 6 on a week night. Of course the table was late, 0

It's the ghetto version of pei Wei.  It's really cheap but nothing to be excited . I had higher expectation because the owner  also ones Saigon in chandler.   I wish the food is more authentic like Saigon., 0
I guess this is what you should expect poolside at Aria. Windy, 0
Place has terrible parking., 0
I was really ecstatic when they first built this gas station down the street from my home. I bought a house down the street in 2008. I was excited because there wasn't another gas station that was anywhere near as close as this one. But apparently the person who bought the franchise or the person who owns a gas station also knows that there's not a gas station anywhere close. Therefore it's not atypical to see a line of 10 to 15 people waiting to purchase something from the person behind the counter with a training badge that's obviously only been on the job for a few days. There is an extremely high turnover rate of employees at this location. I know cashiers are not making the big bucks but but I also know that the economy is not handing out jobs left and right. It's obvious that the management at this location isn't too concerned about their customers satisfaction  or their employees' happiness   I don't have anything negative to say about the people that are working behind the counter, 0
Too hyped, 0

First off - this is now 2.75 Cleaners (looks like they changed the sign outside).  Absolutely THEE worst customer experience we have EVER received.  DO NOT go here.  Because of the location, 0
This place is a shithole.. I will never go back... service was rude...the rooms are nothing special and try to find your way back to your room at 6:00am.. impossible !!! The layout of the hotel is very confusing and the staff not helpful at all...., 0
The office has the worse front desk staff and billing  ever experienced. The wait is almost always a minimum of 2 hours. They do not bill according to insurance and overcharge on copays. The office manager Chris is very rude and negative and should go to charm school. Unfortunately, 0
One of the most mediocre restaurants I ever had dinner. very expensive, 0
Not happy with them right now. Washer still making an awful noise and I hate it when mechanics and repairmen think we are dumb because we are women.   Does this washer sound like it is fixed to you?  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=4888691213446  The repairman Greg said all it needed was a some lube.   Worked for about 3 loads and now it is worse than it was before.   Thankfully, 0

Well I had that stayed here and the rooms were ok with a kitchen. They also had a 24 hr pool  which is pretty cool. The "resort" also offers shuttle service allover the strip and downtown. I just feel bad for anyone that buys this as a timeshare not realizing west Tropicana is pretty ghetto and not close to the strip. Yeah I think I would skip this if I was looking into this and get a room at Stratosphere or Excalibur cheaper, 0
Me and the wifey finally made it to this place. We are big seafood/oyster fans and as most of you know there are few options for good oysters in CLT area. Oysters were good but way pricey. Everything else was an epic FAIL. Service was weak. Bartenders and servers were lethargic. Draft beer was flat. We sat in bar area at a hightop and watched beer after beer get returned for same reason. Bartender did nothing to adjust CO2. He was more concerned with the FSU-NCSU football game. Wife ordered glass of Chardonnay  and the pour on the wine was very weak as well. Maybe a 1/4 glass full. Other food besides oysters were disappointing. Salad was dry and looked old and tasted bland. Left at 6: 45 on Saturday evening and the place had 12 people inside. Unless late night rocks it out this place won't make it. Disappointing way to start a Saturday night. Two stars only because oysters were fresh and did taste good., 0
If this is what you're into for donuts and coffee, 0
Waited 45 minutes after entering the room. Very rude in how they push their shots and lecture you. Choose a different place that is cleaner for your kids., 0
If I could give this no stars I would but it isn't an option.  Food was mediocre and the prices ridiculous for what you got.  Service was worse.  The menu said it had vegetarian options but all that meant was you pay for the same item minus the meat and you don't get any money taken off for removing the meat.  I ordered the vegetarian taco salad and it was atrocious.  It was a taco bowl that was over cooked and shredded ice berg lettuce, 0
If i could give this place less than one star I would.  First, 0
We had a membership a few years ago and it was fantastic. We rejoined a few months ago and are very disappointed. They seem to have the same selection of small quality shows every day. We used to see great shows all the time but no more. Seems they need to put the same energy they used to have back in to the service. If you are thinking of joining, 0

This is not the nicest area. Nor is this the nicest Safeway.  There's a gate you have to have a security guard open to get into the health and beauty selection.   I've been to a lot of Safeways in my day and gotta tell ya. That's a first for me.  And armed guard watching you while you pick up your unmentionables? Yep, 0
The husband asked for McD's tonight so I humored him and agreed to go. I figured DT wouldn't be a problem since they are normally pretty fast. The car infront of me at the speaker was placed on hold for every bit of 5 minutes. They ordered a single cone. Now it's my turn, 0
Very clean hotel.jacuzzi is very huge, 0
My two stars are based solely on the service, 0
Was not impressed at all.  The female bartender was nice but the male bartender was a dick.  I ordered a sandwich from the female bartender and 2 minutes later I hear the male bartender talking shit about what I ordered to other guys sitting at the bar (who he didn't seem to be friends with, 0
I went to Pearl this past weekend with 3 of my girlfriends.  We were looking for a restaurant that didn't have a long wait since we were hungry.  We learned a valuable lesson:  this is not the way to chose a restaurant!  The reason why there was no wait here was because the overpriced food isn't all that great!  I only gave this restaurant 2 stars because the food is the same quality if not less than the typical Chinese restaurant close to home, 0
Hate, 0
I was not impressed. Food quality was low and tasted cheap. I have no idea why ppl rave about it. I won't go back. Liberty is across the parking lot and a thousand times better plus they use local food., 0
Always get the fajita burrito with extra rice. My chipotle experiances have always been great except for this chipotle. The service is not super friendly, 0
This was not a pleasant experience. Marianne seemed "off". She was pleasant but slurred her words like maybe she was on pain meds or has been drinking. She would forget mid sentence what she was talking about. Very odd interaction. Then after, 0
This place is a royal rip off.   Because of the location on The Strip, 0
Nix was a decent burger joint located in downtown Charlotte. Their local beer draft selection wasn't very big but they did have some good ones. We went on a sat night and they weren't busy at all. It would be a great place to take a group of friends. The atmosphere was decent but the waitstaff was slow and inattentive.   Burgers weren't the best quality of beef and it showed. If you like a lot of topping choice though this is your place. The house made pimento cheese tasted like melted cheese dip. It was ok. Our experience wasn't that great. We wouldn't go back., 0
Typical Vegas nightclub. If you like spending hella money on drinks and getting pushed and shoved on the dancefloor and even in your vip area... go here.  Music is also typical mainstream, 0
I am writing this as a very angry customer.  I have been to this place many times and love the food and atmosphere.  Yesterday on my way home went thru the drive thru (1st time ever) and it was difficult to understand the worker and we went back and forth about the order for too long.  I waited and the food came out at an acceptable time.  I did not check my order and went home. (about 7 miles away).  When I got home I discovered that we did not have our complete order.  All that was in the bag was the chips and salsa...NOT THE 2 burritos I ordered.  I was pretty mad because now I had to drive all the way back and get this corrected.  Driving over I calmed down and thought this may be my error for driving off too quickly.  I entered the dining room and waited my turn.  I told the cashier the issue (even said it may have been my fault)and suddenly the drive thru clerk appeared with the 2 burritos.  I told the cashier that I wanted them re-made because it had been about 30 minutes and I did not want cold food.  At this point the drive thru clerk started to argue with me and told me this was my fault.  I was not about to argue about who's fault this was, 0
We decided to try Switch for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  It was at 2:30pm that we got there and the dining room was very empty, 0

Shame Shame Shame on you Hikari. I have used yelp for many years just for searching restaurant reviews but have not ever joined this site until now.  I have never ever been this upset at a business until i stepped into this one.  I would never ever set foot into this business again.  My family and i total of 7 paying adults came in for the ALL YOU CAN EAT.  My youngest daughter is only 2 years old which is the 8th person and only likes to eat a couple of California rolls which i did not think it was a problem to just give her some off of ours from the all you can eat order we are getting.  When ordering the server  taking our order said it was not OK to do that but if she ordered something from the kids meal then she can and so we did what she had told us.  We ordered something off the kids meal which was chicken and rice for over $8 which my daughter did not like at all and started eating a little of our California rolls which i mean just a couple of pieces of our food which we where told it was OK by our server.  Our server comes back to us looking like she made the biggest mistake ever goes and tells us that her lady manager said to her we cant do that and for her to tell us that our 2 year old daughter can not eat off of our plates.  The manager wanted to charge us the full kids buffet price of roughly over $16 dollars and don't forget she is just 2 years old.  We did not make this mistake that employee made this mistake by telling us something that is not true and as a professional manager of a restaurant they should have honored what the employee said and not put us into this kind of situation.  My whole family had never ever been so upset that a business would do such a thing to a 2 year old.  the manager wanted to charge us for a full order of California rolls for my 2 year old but we had told her that this is just for my daughter and not us and she cant finish the whole order of California rolls and don't forget we had already paid for a chicken and rice dish that my daughter did not like at all so she can eat a little off our plates because that was what our server said would be OK.  The lady manager had reduced it to half the order of California rolls for half the price but after putting up a fight and telling her that this was wrong and not our fault.  We purchased the half order of California roll because our daughter looked sad that she could not eat ours.  Now to tell you about everything else well you already know how we feel about the service.  We came in first and of course asked for a high chair and asked again and asked again then it finally came after asking 3X so you can see requesting service is just not there but bringing the food we ordered to our table is not a problem but requesting something simple obviously is. My water stayed empty for so long.  If you like quantity over quality then this is the place to go. The sashimi was not cut right from what i know it supposed to be cut in very small pieces not huge pieces.  I felt like i was stepping all over crumbs off the floor walking in. The place is old looking and a little on the depressing side to me.  Knowing we are this upset they still included the tip in the bill and this place doesn't even include any desert in the all you can eat menu so don't expect that.  I have been to one other AYCE up in Vegas when visiting and will be returning back to that one and never ever setting foot back in this one.  I would say that this place with my experience is not kid friendly at all.  Shame Shame Shame on you., 0
Meh.  Mediocre Mexican.  Overpriced, 0
Very low integrity bike shop. Which is now apparent from all of the other yelp reviews (unfortunately I realized this too late). If you don't feel like reading the whole story, 0

Home Depot lost their footing for the average person a long time ago when they obviously started focusing more on the contractor.  As usual I could not get any help even though there was staff around talking to each other.  Among other things I bought large bags of potting soil and hefted them onto the cart myself as well as in my car.  No offer for help the entire time I was there.  At checkout I realized I forget something and I knew it was 2 isles over and there was an extra staff person standing there but did they offer to get it for me?  Nope.  I had to hold everything and dash for the item.  This is why I primarily shop at Lowe's.  Home depot may be a fraction cheaper but unless Lowe's doesn't have what I need... I would just as soon shop some place more welcoming., 0
Not a pleasant experience... I like to find the positive in most anything, 0

***** Lunch buffet review *****  Bottomline: Don't come here for lunch.   While the variety of food may seem plenty, 0
Went Thursday night for dinner before the TSO concert. I had read reviews before we got there. A lot of them were right. Especially about the service or lack there of. We were seated and waited about 10 mins for our waiters to grace us with her presence. She didn't introduce herself or anything. I asked for a drink menu and was informed they didn't have one. We ordered margaritas and they were actually very good. 20 mins later she came to take our food order. Ordered fried pickles, 0
I feel like this buffet was nothing too special which made me sad. The Aria is such a pretty hotel with other nice places to hang out and eat and this was just less than what I expected. I should've taken my 30something bucks and just gone back to the spa and brought a pastry from Jean Phillipe with me. I was underwhelmed - the spread is not exciting at lunch. I guess I expected something new, 0
I'd leave 0 stars if possible. HORRIBLE service. Nobody working. Huge line and a general attitude of "I don't give a crap" from the supervisor. Avoid at all costs., 0
bad service from the get go, 0
Absolutely horrible service! They not only charged us for waters (the same price as a soda) without mentioning it to is when we ordered, 0
Came here for Thanksgiving dinner and it was terrible. We paid 65 a person plus a mandatory 20% service charge and felt robbed at the end. The food was cold and over salted. The seafood selection was limited to cold shrimp, 0

I haven't been to this place since the remodel. First off, 0
Food taste just like any other location. But what is different about this one is the horrible service.  I have only been there twice and both times I have got probably some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Taking 15minutes for a bean burrito? Then on top of that someone who storms off when you ask him for hot sauce then basically throws it at you when he finally gets it to you. Definitely the last time I'd ever go to this particular one. Wish I could do more than write a review but doesn't look like anyone's had any luck., 0
So far we are here 10 minutes w/o anyone attending to us. The waitress we had the other day with prompt and excellent svc (Livia) isnt here. Apparently shes the only one who actually works. I would give it 1 star but for her good svc last time. The chili, 0
I eat here all the time, 0
Had a business dinner here last week.  My review is short and sweet.  Food was good but nothing special.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere WAY too loud.  Had to shout across the table all night.  But the prices are insanely high.  Just ridiculously so., 0

Me and my wife stopped by the place because of a 20 dollar groupon that we bought because we were checking out that sweet theatre next door. So we went to there cafe. After being seated we were ignored for a good hour. Even trying to flag anyone down was impossible. The waiter just walked by us as if we weren't there. Finally a bus boy took our order. Salad bar was good. Then they messed up on my check and charged me full price on my card. Completely ignoring my groupon. I will never come here again. No wonder there so dead inside., 0
Very poor quality meat, 0
I didn't get food poisoning so they avoided a one star.  Didnt come close to meeting expectations. Food was alright.  I can get better mexican fare at my local Chavez supermarket.  Forget the asian section. Spongey fried fish. Dry ribs. Less than crispy skin on the duck. Onion rings, 0
I went to this place because of a flyer I received in the mail. It said you can come in for a free air pressure check and receive 2 free Diamondback tickets. I needed an oil change so I went in. I was disappointed when I went in and they said they never even had any. I hate false advertisement with a passion. I still got my oil change. I got bothered with the typical up sells which I didn't appreciate after the whole ticket mess. After I was done they couldn't even bring my car to me. I had to go find it and maneuver out of a tight space. Definitely not going to return., 0
Food was cold and the enchilada sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce., 0
We have wanted to try this place for awhile. Yuk I can't even say it was american Mexican sad to say we would have been better with Taco Bell. The service was poor and the enchilada sauce tasted like cheap canned sauce. We love a good taco shop this is not it. My fianc\u00e9 says they should be arrested for pretending to be a authentic Mexican place lol. The shredded beef chimichanga woah they fried the lettuce in the burrito. Never again, 0
Went here over lunch with a group from work and I don't think any of us were very impressed.  Unless you're looking for ordinary chicken strips and fries, 0

This is the first time ever I wrote a bad review but I am just that frustrated with Hertz CLT.  I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site, 0
I went here with my fianc\u00e9 and had the worst dining experience ever. In fact we had to go somewhere else to get a drink to wash it down because we both felt sick after.  I had gluten free pancakes and he had French toast with eggs and bacon.  The pancakes tasted like butter, 0
Not the best Italian food I have have., 0

This is the worst McDonald's I've been to. The service is always horrible. The only reason I ever go there is because it's the closest location to my home. Also it's obvious that the management is to blame. The workers are lazy and have no manners never say thank you. I don't usually write bad reviews but people need to know not to go here and this will be my last time too., 0
